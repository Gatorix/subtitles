00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:24,250
科塔
Kota.

2
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,250
在国内外的教育领域
In the area of education this city has created an identity for itself..

3
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,875
这座城市为自己创造了独特的形象
..nationally as well as internationally.

4
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,000
从一开始，马赫什瓦里教育
And right from the start, Maheshwari classes..

5
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:36,542
就在这条通往胜利的道路上高举成功的旗帜
..has been carrying the banner of success on this path to victory.

6
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,958
在30年的时间里
Within a span of 30 years

7
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:41,625
马赫什瓦里教育树立了一个伟大的目标——
Maheshwari classes has embarked upon a mission..

8
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,208
展望整个教育行业
..that envisions the whole world of education..

9
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,417
服务范围从标准八年级教育直至大学
..with services from standard eighth till university.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,750
在这种追求中，马赫什瓦里教育的师资力量
In this pursuit Maheshwari classes has to give credit to its team..

11
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:55,000
教学方法和以学生为中心的教育理念是至关重要的
..teaching methodology and student-centric approach.

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,333
我们非常注重学生的需求
We are now catering to the need of the students..

13
00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,125
无论是在学习周期中
..throughout their academic cycle..

14
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,417
还是已经步入职业生涯
..till their step into their professional life.

15
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,417
如此形成一个完整的教育枢纽
The complete educational hub.

16
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:07,917
千里之行，始于足下
The journey of thousand miles begins with a single step.

17
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:13,000
从只有一个教室开始，我们一路走来
The credit for having come this far after starting with one classroom..

18
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,042
有请我们的学生
..goes only to our students.

19
00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:16,360
吉安 · 米塔尔
Gyan Mittal.

20
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:19,946
 JEE高考状元，来听听他的看法
All India Rank one JEE Advanced, listen to his own words

21
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,625
我的成功完全归功于马赫什瓦里教育
All the credit for my success goes to Maheshwari classes.

22
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,708
这里是 IIT、JEE考试最好的教练
It is the best coaching for IIT JEE.

23
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:27,542
每年都有高分学员从这里走出来
Year after year the best results come from here.

24
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:33,708
在这不仅可以参加 JEE 考试，还可以参加 NEET、奥林匹克、 KVPY、 NTSE 等考试
Not only in JEE, but also in NEET, Olympiad, KVPY, NTSE and other exams.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,838
马赫什瓦里教育，我们将一起做出改变
Maheshwari classes, We will make a change together.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,214
科塔
Kota.

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,753
在国内外的教育领域
In the area of education this city has made a name for itself..

28
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,135
这座城市为自己创造了独特的形象
..nationally as well as internationally.

29
00:01:48,552 --> 00:01:51,385
从一开始，马赫什瓦里教育
And right from the start, Maheshwari classes..

30
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:55,009
就在这条通往胜利的道路上高举成功的旗帜
..has been carrying the banner of success on this path to victory.

31
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,259
在30年的时间里，马赫什瓦里教育树立了一个伟大的目标——
Within a span of 30 years Maheshwari classes has embarked..

32
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:01,344
您说的我们都清楚，先生
It's not as though we were unaware, sir.

33
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,594
我们甚至在4月份就申请了辅导班
We even sought admissions for coaching in April..

34
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:06,509
但那是在伊塔尔西本地
..but that was in Itarsi. Local.

35
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,219
即便是在那里，瓦伊巴夫的成绩也不错
Vaibhav was doing very well even over there.

36
00:02:09,594 --> 00:02:10,884
他是班上的前三名
He was amongst the top three..

37
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:14,177
但是到了11月份全国大考的时候
..but when the All India test series took place in November..

38
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,469
我们才开了眼界
..that's when our eyes opened.

39
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,344
先生，瓦伊巴夫的朋友皮尤什是你的学生
Sir, Vaibhav's friend Piyush is your student.

40
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:23,177
他在学校的成绩落后于瓦伊巴夫，你可以向他确认
He lagged behind Vaibhav in school. You can confirm from him.

41
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:25,427
可现在就连他也跑在了瓦伊巴夫前面
Even he shot ahead of Vaibhav...

42
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,010
先生，瓦伊巴夫是个非常用功的学生
Sir, Vaibhav is a very hardworking student.

43
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:33,802
他很刻苦，但伊塔尔西缺乏科塔的教学设施
He even studies a lot but Itarsi lacks the facilities of Kota.

44
00:02:34,385 --> 00:02:36,219
那里只有一个小培训班
Only one small institute exists there.

45
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:40,677
只有“成功”和“王牌”是小型的，戈埃尔班今年有400名学生
Only 'Success' and 'Ace' are small. Goel-classes has 400 students this year.

46
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,885
是的，我儿子瓦伊巴夫正在上戈埃尔的课
Yes, sir. My Vaibhav was attending Goel classes.

47
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,260
-他是戈埃尔的学生? -是的
He was attending Goel? - Yes.

48
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,552
那他的化学一定很差
Then he must be pretty weak in chemistry.

49
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:50,469
他不可能跟上我们的进度
He won't be able to cover it alone.

50
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:55,385
不，先生，我儿子很聪明，他在高中的成绩是90%
No, sir. The boy is smart. He scored 90 percent in high school.

51
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,469
-相信我，他一定能跟上来 -不，他不会
Trust me sir, he will be able to follow. - No. He won't.

52
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:03,219
超过70万的印度学生在高中能得90%
Pan India more than 7 lakh students score 90 percent in 10th grade.

53
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,416
仅在CBSE（中央中等教育委员会）就有超过20万人
More than 2 lakhs in CBSE alone.

54
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,804
可是印度理工学院有多少座位？
And how many seats do they have in IIT?

55
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,447
只有5273个
5273 only.

56
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:15,156
如果得90%就能上印度理工就好了
If only the students with over 90 percent appear for IIT..

57
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:18,030
即便如此，其中的99%
..even then 99 percent of those

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,096
都是考不上的
won't make it.

59
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,652
先生，部长写了这封信您看一下
Sir, the Minister forwarded this letter.

60
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,186
他还打了电话给我
He even called me.

61
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,788
这就是我当面拒绝的原因
That's why I am refusing in person.

62
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,609
我不会给你任何承诺，但这是为你儿子好
Look, I won't make tall promises but it would be beneficial to Vaibhav..

63
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:38,404
等四月份12年级开学时再来吧
..to join us when the 12th grade batches start in April.

64
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,138
和其他人一起
With all the others.

65
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,036
佛祖保佑
Jai Shree Krishna

66
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,479
你能和皮尤什聊聊吗？
Could you talk to Piyush?

67
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:11,313
能聊的时候应该都能收到录取通知书了
We should have taken admissions back then only.

68
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,438
你们俩本来可以在一起的
Both of you would have been together.

69
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:17,647
不管怎样，如果这里不行，也许别的地方可以
Anyways, if not here then maybe somewhere else.

70
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:20,581
但是现在这里是最好的
But nowadays this is the number one.

71
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,844
你开你车
You better focus on driving

72
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:23,605
插什么嘴
Smartass.

73
00:06:23,772 --> 00:06:25,355
你们去塔万迪萨博哪里?  “神童教育”对吧？
Where in Talwandi? 'Prodigy?'

74
00:06:32,397 --> 00:06:34,105
你来科塔多久了，兄弟？
How long have you been in Kota, brother?

75
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:39,063
孩子，我来科塔的时候它还是一个城市，而不是一个工厂
Son, I've been in Kota since the time it used to be a city, not a factory.

76
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,938
当时的培训班没有制服
Back then coaching classes did not have any uniforms..

77
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:48,980
而且都集中在科塔一个叫做“维根纳加”的小地方
..and this environment was confined to a small locality of 'Vigyan Nagar.

78
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,938
多么恰当的名字! 不是吗，先生？
What an apt name! Ain't it, sir?

79
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:55,272
是的，阿加瓦尔的一些教育机构曾经就在那里
Yes, some Agarwal classes used to be there.

80
00:06:55,355 --> 00:07:00,688
一些? 阿加瓦尔先生曾经是这里的统治者，先生
Some? There was a time when Mr.Agarwal used to rule, sir.

81
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,772
现在可能有很多的导师，但他是唯一真正的教父
There may be many dons today, but he is the only true Godfather.

82
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,522
科塔工厂就是由他建立的
This Jurassic park was established by him.

83
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:13,772
他虽然不叫柯里昂，但他是所有人的教父
His name may not be Corleone but he is Godfather to all.

84
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:17,147
他被称为科塔的斯蒂芬·霍金斯
He is called the Stephen Hawkins of Kota.

85
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:19,229
不是霍金斯，是霍金
Not Hawkins. Hawking.

86
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,480
哈?-霍金，国王
Huh? - Hawking. King.

87
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,063
对，是的，他是国王
Yes, yes. He is the king.

88
00:07:23,938 --> 00:07:26,063
他自己的孩子可能没考上印度理工学院
His own children may not have made it to IIT..

89
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:29,147
但是他让成千上万的孩子成功考进去了
..but he has got thousands of others through.

90
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,789
虽然他不能走路，但他让上万的家庭能够自食其力
Though he couldn't walk by himself but has helped lakhs run their household.

91
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:37,605
就是因为他，这个城市的每间屋子都有租客
Sir, its because of him every other house in the city has a PG..

92
00:07:37,772 --> 00:07:39,355
然而每个街角都是一团糟
..and a mess at every corner.

93
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,188
而且也是注定如此
And it has to be.

94
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,355
因为每年有超过20万的学生来到这里
As every year more than 2 lakh students come here.

95
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:48,063
随便扔一块石头，肯定会砸到学生的
Toss a stone blindly.. ..it's bound to hit a student.

96
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,772
你可别真扔啊
Hey! But don't toss one.

97
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,105
这不是一个城市，而是一个巨大的旅馆
This is not a city, sir. But rather a very big hostel.

98
00:07:56,604 --> 00:08:01,128
在这里，人们关注的并不是哪个培训机构能公布教学大纲
Here the battle is not whether an institute could post the solutions or not

99
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,480
而是哪个机构能够率先做到
But instead, which institute did it first.

100
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:08,438
这里的每个人都疯了
Everyone here is crazy, sir.

101
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,438
到处都在谈论
Everywhere there is discourse..

102
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:13,938
哪个机构向高分学生收费的问题
..about which institute charged fees from the topper..

103
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,272
高分学生是从哪个机构出来的
..which institute really educated him..

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,605
哪个机构只是买了他的头衔
..and which one simply bought off his rank.

105
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:21,272
哪个老师被谁挖走了？
Which teacher was poached by whom?

106
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:24,730
哪个教员辞职自己创业了？
Which faculty quit to start on his own?

107
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,522
反过来又是谁离开了他的教育机构？
And who in turn is quitting his institute?

108
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,022
好好学习吧！
Study a little!

109
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:31,188
专心开车，兄弟
Focus on your driving, brother.

110
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,980
这里有点像“大老板”
It is a kind of 'Big Boss' running here.

111
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,688
你看“大老板”了吗?-是的
Do you watch Big boss? - Yes, I do.

112
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:37,583
这里没人看
Nobody watches it here.

113
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,837
这是印度唯一一个
This is the only city in India..

114
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:45,250
三星打不过诺基亚的城市
..where Nokia dominates Samsung.

115
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:49,180
如果一定要说的话
If I must add, sir..

116
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:53,563
来这里的学生可能有些不会被选中
..all the students who come here may not get selected..

117
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:57,147
但是一个没有被选中的学生
..but a student who doesn't get selected from here..

118
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:59,396
本就不该被选中
..was never meant to be.

119
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:31,688
去忙你的吧，我在这等着
Get your work done. I'll wait.

120
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,813
可以的，先生
Yes. It's done, sir.

121
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,147
你确定？
Sure?

122
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,647
绝对没问题
We will get it done, sir.

123
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,230
要有信心，我姐夫开办这个学院时只有一个教室
Be confident. My brother-in-law started this institute with just one room.

124
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:51,730
你看看现在
And look at it today.

125
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:54,897
确实很了不起，但是他能跟上进度吗
that's all impressive but will he be able to manage on his own?

126
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:58,646
怎么会跟不上呢？ 他高中考试得了90%，这可不是开玩笑的
Why not? He scored 90 percent in the boards. That is not a joke.

127
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,688
这孩子很聪明
The boy is sharp .

128
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:06,980
但是我听说印度理工学院只有5273个座位，所以..
But I heard IIT has only 5273 seats. So..

129
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,771
但是先生，你只需要一个
But sir, you only need one.

130
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:13,298
瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

131
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,462
他只是想招你进去
Just because he is willing to enroll..

132
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:17,147
并不意味着你一定要在这补习
..doesn't necessarily mean that you have to accept.

133
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:20,230
今年最好呆在家里做好准备
Better stay at home and prepare this year..

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,813
在12年级的时候直接去马赫什瓦里教育
..and aim for Maheshwari in 12th grade.

135
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:28,980
爸爸，即使我必须要等12年级才能去马赫什瓦里教育
Dad, even if I have to take admission in Maheshwari for the 12th grade..

136
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:31,266
那就先让我在这补习吧
..let me study in here only.

137
00:10:31,656 --> 00:10:33,712
我在家里没办法学习
I can't do it at home.

138
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,022
给他登记，把学习资料给他发一份
Enroll him and hand him the material.

139
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:47,021
-分到哪个组? -IIT JEE（印度理工学院联合入学考试） A10组
Which batch? - IIT JEE A10.

140
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,980
A10？
A10?

141
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:52,313
-你们一共有多少组? -只有十组，先生
How many batches do you have in all? - Only ten, sir.

142
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:53,730
我们没有太多的分组
We don't have too many batches.

143
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,646
少教，教好
Teach less but teach well!!

144
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,397
爸爸，皮尤什告诉我，靠后的组就不会得到什么关注了
Dad, Piyush was telling me that lower batches don't get any attention.

145
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,730
谁说的？
Says who?

146
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,563
-我们没人关注吗? -有的，先生
Do we give attention or not? - We do, sir.

147
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,772
-我曾在A7组 -他在 A7
I myself was in A7. - He was in A7.

148
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,063
先生，收钱可以，但请确保分组靠前
Sir, charge the entire fees if you wish but please ensure a better batch.

149
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:17,688
是这样的，先生，两年的全部费用无论如何都要收的
Look, sir. Entire fees for 2 years will be charged anyways.

150
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,772
但是他的分组暂时改不了
..but he will still be in batch A10.

151
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,230
这是我姐夫的政策
It's brother-in-law's policy.

152
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:23,510
但分组不是永久性的
But this batch won't be permanent.

153
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:25,313
改组考试将在两个月后进行
Reshuffling tests will take place after two months..

154
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,063
你考个不错的成绩
..and you will do well in it.

155
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,563
这样分组就提前了
That's it. Batch changed.

156
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,230
这是你的学习资料，制服暂时没有现货
This is your material. Uniforms are not in stock.

157
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:44,605
后天你就可以拿到了
You will get it by day after tomorrow.

158
00:11:44,813 --> 00:11:47,605
有三所学校可供选择
And you have a choice of three schools. You can enroll yourself in any.

159
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,355
这些学校中哪一所是好学校？
Which of these is a good school?

160
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,188
这有什么关系? 他又不用去
How does it matter? He doesn't have to attend.

161
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:54,772
我们与这三家学校都有合作
We have a tie-up with all three.

162
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:59,688
-好的，我先去把这个收起来 -好的
Okay. I'll go and put this away. - Yes.

163
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:49,821
你好
Hello.

是的，皮尤什

165
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:55,863
是的，你终于有时间给我打电话了

166
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,321
我是瓦伊巴夫

167
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,279

168
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:03,404
这是我的科塔号码，存一下吧

169
00:13:04,738 --> 00:13:06,196
是的，今天
Yes. Today.

170
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,113
不，不在马赫什瓦里，是神童教育
No, not in Maheshwari. Prodigy.

171
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:13,654
为什么要感谢上帝？
Why thank God?

172
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:15,613
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

173
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,238
他们在马赫什瓦里教了这么多东西，这是件好事
It's a good thing they teach so much at Maheshwari.

174
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:19,946
是的
Yes.

175
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,084
那个一直让我做租客的女士很好，她非常好
The lady who kept me as PG is nice. She is very nice.

176
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:26,251
她说我就像她的儿子邦蒂
She told me I'm like her son Bunty.

177
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,632
别管那个了，我们见个面吧
Oh, never mind that. Let's meet.

178
00:13:34,492 --> 00:13:36,867
开课之后我就不能来维根纳加了
Once studies begin I won't be able to come to Vigyan Nagar.

179
00:13:37,314 --> 00:13:38,439
要我过去吗？
Shall I come?

180
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:41,588
哦，我明白了
Oh, I see.

181
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,610
那就明天？
Tomorrow then?

182
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,421
好的，如果你明天没有额外的课就告诉我，我们见个面
Ok. Let me know if you don't have extra classes tomorrow. Will meet.

183
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,041
喂？
Hello?

184
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:54,834
喂？
Hello?

185
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,001
我可以进来吗？
May I come in?

186
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:16,792
我是米纳，神童，A5组

187
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,267
你看到楼下的储藏室了吗?-看到了
You've seen the storeroom downstairs? - Yes.

188
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,584
那是我的房间-知道了
That's my room. - I see.

189
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:25,417
你离开时是不是没关净水机？
You left the RO turned on downstairs. What..?

190
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,334
是的，没有水
Yes. There was no water,

191
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:30,834
所以我想我忘记关了，对不起
so I guess I left it turned on. Sorry.

192
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:34,709
用完后把插头拔掉，否则阿姨会很不高兴的
Remove the plug after you use it. Else aunty gets very upset.

193
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:35,751
哦！
Oh!

194
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,834
阿姨很严格吗？
Is aunty very strict?

195
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:39,959
今天早上她对我说话还挺客气的
She spoke to me very sweetly this morning.

196
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:42,167
她在家长面前当然表现很和蔼了
She is bound to speak nicely in front of parents.

197
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,480
家长离开后才是她的真面目
She should have the guts to speak nicely once they've left. Right?

198
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,334
我有一个双向插座，你也可以用
I have a two way socket. You can have it.

199
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:52,959
插座，为什么？
Socket. Why?

200
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:54,542
等你的室友来的时候，你们一定每天晚上都会打架
When your roommate comes he will fight every night..

201
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:57,167
手机充电只有一个插头
..for phone charging. There is only one plug.

202
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,708
不，我一个人住这里
No, I will stay here by myself.

203
00:14:59,047 --> 00:14:59,829
一个人？
All alone?

204
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,297
是啊
Ya.

205
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,667
房租会很贵
The rent will be quite a bit.

206
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,542
如果你有资源，为什么不去马赫什瓦里？
Why didn't you go to Maheshwari if you have the resources?

207
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,626
在马赫什瓦里要得到入学许可并不容易
It is not so easy to get admission in Maheshwari.

208
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,834
是吗? 我被录取了
Isn't it? I got admitted.

209
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:17,376
在马赫什瓦里?-是的

210
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,026
那为什么..
Then why...

211
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,876
这里的学费要低得多，而且他们还用印地语教学
The fee here is far lower and also they teach in Hindi.

212
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,416
另外，杰图·拜亚也在这里
Also, Jeetu Bhaiya is here.

213
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:24,876
杰图·拜亚？
Jeetu Bhaiya?

214
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,667
你怎么会不知道杰图·拜亚？
How come you don't know Jeetu Bhaiya?

215
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:29,709
你是从哪条路来的? 他的广告牌到处都是
By which route did you come? His hoardings are all over the place.

216
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,834
他是科塔最好的物理老师
He is the best teacher of physics in Kota..

217

在非学术界排名第三
..and number three at Unacademy.

218
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,291
非学术界？
Unacademy?

219
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,791
'非学术界'是印度最大的教育类'猩猩'
It is India's biggest education ape.

220
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,209
猩猩？
Ape?

221
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:43,876
你都不知道'猩猩'? 那你还上什么印度理工学院？
You don't know ape? Then how will you make it through to IIT?

222
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,709
你应该知道手机里面的一个个小方块……
You know the tiny boxes in mobiles. If you send something..

223
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:48,792
应用程序
Oh! App.

Yes. Ape. Jeetu Bhaiya has uploaded the entire syllabus of JEE on it.

225
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:54,626
你可以随时学习，甚至老师也可以从中学习
You can study anytime you wish. Even teachers learn from it.

226
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:58,416
坦率地说，杰图·拜亚就是没有参加竞选
Frankly, just that Jeetu Bhaiya isn't contesting the elections..

227
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,042
否则他一定是最好的候选人
..else he would have been the best candidate.

228
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,959
你是杰图·拜亚的粉丝?-当然
So you are Jeetu Bhaiya's fan? - Absolutely.

229
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,001
那个人值得粉丝拥护
That man is deserving of fans.

230
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,876
他一刻不停地解答有关国际物理学的论文

印度所有顶尖的物理老师

232
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:25,751
都把他们的问题汇总起来找他解答

233
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:41,584
他的工资是10的7次方以上
His salary is more than 10 to the power of 7.

234
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:56,417
然而，他很开朗、和蔼并且平易近人
Yet he is cheerful, affable and light-hearted.

235
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,751
等等，净水机没有水
Just a minute. Just a minute. Water did not come out of the RO.

236
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:05,626
那你是怎么喝的水？
Then how did you drink?

237
00:17:11,084 --> 00:17:12,834
这是乌代的房间
This is Uday's room.

238
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:16,751
他来自乌代布尔，但他告诉阿姨他来自巴特那
He is from Udaipur but he told aunty he is from Patna.

239
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:18,416
为什么？
Why?

240
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:22,084
我不知道
That I don't know.

241
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,626
你没问吗？
Didn't you ask?

242
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,584
我为什么要问这个？考试又不考
Why would I ask! It's not a syllabus question.

243
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,876
"一个人陈述，另一个人点头，大师说两个人都是聪明人"
'One said and the other agreed. Nanak says both are wise.'

244

施万吉女士非常棒

249
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:45,565
她是乌代的朋友，但跟我更有感情
She's Uday's friend but has more affection for me.

250
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,209
乌代整天在她那学习

他很能学习，甚至都不来上课

252
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,417

253
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,334
米纳

You are like a son to aunty, right?

259
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:10,917
从走廊传来的声音在这里可以听到

I am Shivangi. Uday's girlfriend but have told aunty that I am his cousin.

262
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,751
冰箱可能是公共的，但我不是
The fridge may be public, I'm not.

263
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:23,167
所以你可以来着打水
So do come, fetch water and leave.

264
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:25,167
但没有必要闲聊
There is no need for small talk..

265
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,792
除非你有物理和化学的问题
..unless you have doubts in physics and chemistry.

266
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,292
但是只有在米纳解决不了的时候才可以问我
And that too only if Meena is unable to clear it.

267
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,167
解题标准价是半小时两块泡芙
Doubt solving expert. The standard rate is two puffs for 30 minutes..

268
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,084
一小时三块
..and three puffs for one hour.

269
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,292
只有物理和化学吗? 你的数学一定很差
Only physics and chemistry? You must be weak in math.

270
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,917
我的数学最好，生物最差
I was strongest in math. It's bio that I was weak in..

271
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:46,167
但是我要学医，因为我爸爸是印度理工学院毕业的
..but I am doing medical because dad is an IITian.

272
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:51,126
你爸爸是印度理工毕业的啊? 哇塞！
Your dad is an IITian? Even dads are IITians?

273
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,959
太棒了！
That's great!

274
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:54,626
他想让你进入医学界
And he wants you to get into medicine.

275
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,042
让家庭成员的职业富有多样性
There should be variety in the family.

276
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:57,959
一定是这样的
Correct.

277
00:18:58,084 --> 00:19:00,167
-考虑真周全-周全个屁
IITian thinks correctly. - Variety my foot!

278
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:03,126
爸爸是理工学院的，所以他了解那里
Dad is an IITian, that's why he knows the truth about IIT.

279
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,417
他不能把他唯一的女儿送到那些贪婪的
He can't send his only daughter amidst the lusting engineers..

280
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,876
充满了雄性激素工程师中去
..who are brimming with testosterone.

281
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,708
他不能接受减数分裂
He won't be able to endure the meiosis.

282
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:12,167
我穿了你的短裤，我的还在洗，没关系吧
I wore your bermudas. I hope it is okay. My clothes are in the wash.

283
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,542
没关系，我以后也穿你的
It is okay. I shall wear yours someday.

284
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,009
行，你穿正合适
Actually, they will suit you.

285
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:38,292
食堂7:30开餐，早点去
The mess starts at 7:30. Go early to eat..

286
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:41,084
去晚了就没有奶酪了，而且咖喱里只剩下菠菜
..else cheese will be gone leaving only spinach in the curry.

287
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:42,542
我们一起去吧
Let's go together.

288
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,084
不，我在禁食我得早点睡觉
No, no. I am fasting. I have to sleep early.

289
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,292
我早上6点有课
I have classes at 6 AM.

290
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:48,084
早上吃炸甜面圈
I'll have Poha n Jalebi early morning.

291
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,583
上课？
Class?

292
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:50,667
这么早？
So early?

293
00:19:51,334 --> 00:19:52,167
但是我的时间表是……
But my time-table..

294
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,667
杰图老师跑得比时间表快
Jeetu Bhaiya runs faster than the time-table.

295
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:55,792
你会知道的
You will have it too.

296
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,584
你在哪个组？-A10
Which batch were you alloted? - A10.

297
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:02,292
你接受了? A10？
And you accepted it? A10.

298
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:06,167
是的，迪帕克先生说没问题
Yes. Deepak sir said it won't be a problem.

299
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:08,917
为什么？
Why?

300
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,209
为什么? A10怎么了？
Why? What's wrong with A10?

301
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,885
怎么了? 先生，且不说联合入学考试
Wrong? Sir, leave aside JEE advance..

302
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:15,001
他们甚至没有准备好普通考试
..they don't even prepare one well for MAINS exams.

303
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,292
毫无疑问没有任何额外课程
No extra classes. No doubt session. No DPP.

304
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,251
时间也会被浪费
Also time gets wasted.

305
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,542
这都是谁告诉你的？
Who provided you all these insights?

306
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:27,584
听着，你来得已经很晚了，我们破例录取了你
Look, you came very late as it is. We admitted you.

307
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:29,792
现在你觉得分组靠后，想改分组
Now you feel the batch is wrong. Change the batch.

308
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:33,251
不是你想怎样就怎样的，孩子，这是你的第一天，积极一点
It's not what you think. It's your first day. Be positive.

309
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,792
快去学习吧，所有组都一样的
Just start studying. The batch makes no difference.

310
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,376
先生，如果分组没有区别的话就把我调到别的组
Sir, if it makes no difference then transfer me.

311
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:38,751
哪个组都行
To any other batch.

312
00:20:39,084 --> 00:20:40,792
先生，如果我就是A10组的水平
And sir, if I am worthy of A10..

313
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,459
那我就待到改组
..then I shall end up there after the reshuffling.

314
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,958
不不不，绝对不可能
No. No. Not possible.

315
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:50,583
这是我们这的规矩，我们不会给予神童的学生任何特殊待遇
It's a rule. We don't give special treatment to anyone in Prodigy classes.

316
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,626
无论是学生还是老师
Be it a student or faculty.

317
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,459
但是，先生，A10...-杰图先生！
But, sir, A10.. - Jeetu sir.

318
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:55,708
你好，先生
How are you, sir?

319
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,917
你好吗?-很好，很好，请坐
How are you? - Good. Good, sir. Please sit.

320
00:20:58,001 --> 00:20:59,376
姐夫昨天很想你
Brother-in-law was missing you yesterday.

321
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,959
杰图最近都没来
Jeetu never comes over.

322
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:02,084
他还打电话给你
He even called you.

323
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,501
姐姐准备了烤鹰嘴豆绒
Sister prepared baked chickpea fluffs.

324
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,001
这正是我没去的原因
That's precisely why I didn't come over.

325
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,209
你姐做饭真难吃
Your sister is a very bad cook

326
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:09,167
直说还很尴尬
Moreover it's awkward to tell her.

327
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,167
真的，迪帕克
This is absolute truth, Deepak.

328
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:17,756
这确实是事实
This indeed is true.

329
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:19,316
去上你的课，孩子
You go to your class, son.

330
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,751
这是物理的入学试卷
This is the entrance test paper for the physics faculty.

331
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,001
你要的
You asked for it.

332
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:27,292
太好了，先生! 太好了! 这纸也很好，先生
That's wonderful, sir! Wonderful! The paper is very good, sir.

333
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:29,083
那就赶紧把我的加班费付一下
Then clear my payment, sir.

334
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:32,376
加班费?-我上个月上了很多额外的课
Payment? - I took so many extra classes last month.

335
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,959
我给你发信息了
I messaged you.

336
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,876
还没付吗?我们马上安排
Hasn't it been cleared as yet? Will get it cleared, sir.

337
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:40,726
那是你的事，如果我周五之前拿不到钱
Yes, it's up to you. If I don't get paid by Friday..

338
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:41,917
我就关机走人
..I'll just switch off the phone and leave.

339
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:42,709
先生
Sir..

340
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,126
有58个国家提供落地签证
There are 58 countries that offer visa on arrival.

341
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,167
我随便去一个
I could be in any of them Then keep looking for me.

342
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:48,667
带我一起去吧，先生
Take me along if you go, sir.

343
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:51,501
如果你走了，我姐夫一定会杀了我的
If you leave because of me, brother-in-law will kill me anyways.

344
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,459
你姐夫才不会呢
Brother-in-law won't let you leave.

345
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:55,167
他还想办神童国际学校
He still wants to start up Prodigy International school..

346
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:57,458
工程学院和大学
..Engineering college and Universities.

347
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,792
他需要你来剥削打工人的工资呢
And he will need someone over there who can cut people's salaries.

348
00:22:01,126 --> 00:22:02,209
先生-给你姐夫带好
Sir. - Say hello.

349
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,126
-是的-先生
Yes. - Sir.

350
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:05,083
-先生，我需要和你谈谈-什么事？
Yes. - Sir, I need to talk to you.

351
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:07,751
-你捣什么乱?-没事
Why are you troubling sir? Sir, it's nothing.

352
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:08,709
等一下，迪帕克
Just a second, Deepak.

353
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:10,042
老师，我叫瓦伊巴夫 · 潘迪
Sir, my name is Vaibhav Pandey.

354
00:22:10,251 --> 00:22:11,542
我昨天报名参加了十一年级的培训
I enrolled in the 11th grade batch yesterday.

355
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:14,501
他来的晚，现在他想升分组
Sir, he is a late admission. Now he wants to upgrade his batch.

356
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,208
等等，老师，他都没让我说完
No, sir. He won't let me tell you the whole story.

357
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,376
听着，瓦伊巴夫·潘迪?-是的，先生
Listen. Vaibhav Pandey? - Yes, sir.

358
00:22:18,501 --> 00:22:20,001
你喜欢求人吗？
Do you enjoy begging?

359
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,251
首先，别再求我了
First of all. Stop begging.

360
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,459
如果你想要达到某个目标，那就努力去实现
If you want something work hard and snatch it.

361
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,251
你现在就是A10了，接受吧
The batch you have now is your truth.

362
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:31,083
两个月后会进行一次测试
A test will take place in two months.

363
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:32,292
努力一下，你的分组就上来了
Make an effort and you will improve.

364
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,876
但是其他人都经历了入学考试
But all the others got batches through entrance exam.

365
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,459
我连入学考试都没有
I didn't even get to take that That is also a truth.

366
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,334
老师，我绝对不是A10的水平
Sir, I definitely deserve a better batch than this.

367
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:43,542
为什么要等两个月? 现在就给我做个测试都可以
Why later? Give me a test now. I am willing to sit for it.

368
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:44,667
您随便问
Ask me questions, sir.

369
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:49,042
好吧
Okay.

370
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:55,234
这有五十道题，明天之前答完
Here are fifty questions. You've until tomorrow. Solve these.

371
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:57,667
你的分组就根据这次成绩来定
The batch you earn after this will be final.

372
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:01,709
怎么了？
What happened?

373
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:03,751
你为什么要插手这件事，老师？
Why are you getting involved in this matter, sir?

374
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,584
-你自己的时间都会被浪费掉-谢谢你，先生
Even your time will be wasted. - Thank you, sir.

375
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,785
现在有一个先例了，其他孩子也会要求同样的待遇
Now seeing him other kids will also demand the same.

376
00:23:10,209 --> 00:23:11,876
你要给多少孩子特殊待遇？
How many kids will you test?

377
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,626
又不是每个孩子都来找我，只有他提出来了
Not everybody demands. Only he did.

378
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:19,417
我们走着瞧，别忘了我的钱
We shall see. Don't forget the payment.

379
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:21,501
好的，没问题
Yes. Your payment will..

380
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,792
这题太难了
I'm not getting this, buddy.

381
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:19,708
吃完泡芙之后，你才说你不会？
After finishing the puffs you say you aren't getting it.

382
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,417
之前看题的时候感觉我会做
Seeing the figure I felt I will be able to do it.

383
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,376
这是啥题啊？
What kind of a question is this?

384
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:29,834
一个人向泡泡机中吹气，要有多少气才能吹出稳定的气泡? 
How hard does one blow into the bubble maker to make a stable bubble?

385
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,751
这题老师从来没教过
This hasn't been taught.

386
00:24:38,402 --> 00:24:39,693
你真不会吗，兄弟？
You really can't do it, bro?

387
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,542
天啊！
God!

388
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,751
皮尤什也不接我电话
Even Piyush isn't answering my call.

389
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,501
我该怎么办? 我被困住了
What should I do? I am trapped.

390
00:24:49,376 --> 00:24:50,751
施万吉也走了
Shivangi too has gone.

391
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:54,834
你都没有学过力学，为什么还要接这套题呢
Why did you agree to this paper when you hadn't studied mechanics?

392
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:56,001
我当时必须要有点魄力才行
I had to be heroic over there.

393
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,376
四个小时我连三道题都没解出来
I can't solve three questions in four hours.

394
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:01,709
而且如果就此放弃又很丢脸
And I will be humiliated if I take this with me.

395
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,626
我们走吧
Let's go then.

396
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:12,251
去哪里？
Where?

397
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:15,209
我吃了你的泡芙，就要解决你的问题
I had the puffs. So the questions will be solved..

398
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,792
不管是我解决还是别人解决
..whether I solve them or someone else does.

399
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,208
来吧
Come.

400
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,792
我还要准备我自己的考试，没有多少时间
I have to prepare for my own Board exams and I have little time.

401
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,459
-你在学什么?-重组
What are you studying for? - Reshuffling.

402
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:36,126
- 你还有两个月的时间呢！-没错
You still have two months to go. - Exactly.

403
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,751
这怎么可能两个月就学完
How will this get done so soon?

404
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:51,334
我也是11年级的学生，还没有学过这些
I too am in 11th grade. We haven't been taught all of this as yet.

405
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,084
你可以问我之前学过的东西
You can ask me anything from before this.

406
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,333
我们11年级的时候学过，但是我都已经忘了
They taught us in the 11th grade. But I've forgotten everything.

407
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,402
你可以问我在这之后学的东西
You can ask me anything that comes after that.

408
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:02,917
“没有悲伤，没有大麻，也没有朗姆酒”
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

409
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:06,209
“我的世界充满了朋友”
"My world is made up of friends."

410
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:11,709
第一题选b，第二个题选a，第三个题选c
The first is B. The second is A. The third is C.

411
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:15,083
这么快，兄弟? 请把答案也写下来，多谢
So soon, brother? Please write the solution as well, brother. Please.

412
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,084
你说这是杰图老师出的题？
You said Jeetu sir set the paper. - Yes.

413
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:21,626
这太简单了，别浪费我的时间
This is too easy. Don't waste my time.

414
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,792
我告诉过你，不是吗? A1的学生非常自私
I told you, didn't I? Students of A1 are very selfish.

415
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:32,001
这太简单了？
This is too easy?

416
00:26:32,084 --> 00:26:35,751
“没有悲伤，没有大麻，也没有朗姆酒”
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

417
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:39,542
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

418
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:45,458
“我以前在书上读到过，现在写在墙上了”
"I had read it in books. Now it is written on the walls."

419
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:49,167
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

420
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,917
当然，兄弟，让我看看，你想让我解决哪个问题？
Sure, bro. Show me. Which question do you want me to solve?

421
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:02,959
给我看看问题，别给我看选项
Just show me the questions. Not the options.

422
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:06,126
解决每个问题
It's just that every question has a journey..

423
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,542
都是一场没有地图的旅行
..which we have to take ourselves without a map.

424
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,792
兄弟，请解第三题
Brother, solve the third one.

425
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,042
我浪费了两年时间来帮别人解题
I wasted two years to do this.

426
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,167
我不会在最后一年还犯同样的错误
I won't make the mistake in the drop year.

427
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,167
我们只需要问一道题，就十分钟
We are only asking you to solve one question. It will take ten minutes.

428
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:21,542
如果我花十分钟为别人解答十个问题
If I take ten minutes to solve ten questions for others..

429
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:25,126
那我就要用一年中的一个月来帮别人解答
..then it will take me one month of the year to clear other's doubts.

430
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:29,251
对我来说，这就是一个'做'和'死'的选择题，我选择'做'
It's a 'do' or 'die' situation for me. And I want to do 'do'.

431
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,454
走吧，再见
Please leave. Please leave. NOW!!

432
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,584
检查一下，答案是8
Check it. The answer is 8.

433
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,584
但是兄弟，所有的选项都在 θ 和 cos θ 中
But bro all the options are in sin theta and cos theta.

434
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:41,501
是吗? 那你换道题
Oh, yeah? Show me another question.

435
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,959
是的，这题看起来很熟悉
Yes, this appears familiar.

436
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,333
-我想我能解决-那来吧兄弟
I think I can solve it. - Then do it, buddy.

437
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:55,542
我已经连续两天死记硬背了
I've been cramming non-stop for two days.

438
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,876
如果我今天再不和我女朋友聊天，她就会和我分手
If I don't speak to my girl today she'll break up with me.

439
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:00,501
请理解一下
Please understand.

440
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,583
是吗宝贝，他真是这么说的吗？
Really, bae. Is that what he said?

441
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,126
然后呢？
What happened after that?

442
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,334
明天再来，我明天帮你解决
Come back tomorrow. I'll solve it for you tomorrow.

443
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:09,917
明天白天来吧
Come during the day tomorrow.

444
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:13,083
有了！答案是根号3/4，检查一下
Ya! Got it. Root 3/4. Check it.

445
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:15,542
前三个选项都是图形
The three options are in form of graph.

446
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:21,667
那第四个选项呢?-以上都不对
And what about the fourth? - None of the above.

447
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,417
那就对了，答案是D
Then that must be it.

448
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:26,417
就这，你瞅瞅，多简单
You see? I solved it, didn't I?

449
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:50,334
你被绿了，是吗？
Your girlfriend betrayed you, didn't she?

450
00:28:51,417 --> 00:28:52,417
这种事时有发生
It happens.

451
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,709
没有，我母胎单身
No. I never had a girlfriend.

452
00:28:57,209 --> 00:28:59,209
那一定是你父母要离婚了吧？
Your parents must be getting divorced?

453
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,333
对吧? 不是吗？
Right? No?

454
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,667
-要不你就是同性恋 -哇兄弟，你是同性恋
Or you must be gay. Wow, bro! You are gay.

455
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,209
-我的第一个同性恋朋友 -滚犊子
My first gay friend. - What nonsense are you speaking?

456
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,292
那是什么原因呢？
Then what is the reason?

457
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:17,417
为什么像你这样一个脆弱无助的男孩
What's the reason that a fragile and helpless boy like you..

458
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:20,584
会在期中的时候来到科塔？
..left his home, school and all else mid semester to come to Kota?

459
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:24,752
很显然你不是天才
You are not a genius. That much is obvious.

460
00:29:25,584 --> 00:29:29,584
米纳，他没告诉我们，但是这家伙一定有一段黑暗的过去
Meena, he isn't telling but this guy has a dark past.

461
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,792
乌代！
Uday.

462
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,042
你就不能找个别的时间捉弄人吗
Can't you find a better time for ragging?

463
00:29:33,626 --> 00:29:35,167
我们有一道题解不出来了
We can't solve one question.

464
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,334
如果你能给我们讲讲机械力学，那你就讲一讲
If you can tell us something about mechanics then tell us..

465
00:29:37,417 --> 00:29:38,876
否则麻烦你安静两分钟
..or else remain quiet for two minutes.

466
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:46,251
我不懂力学，但第三个问题的答案是 c
I don't know about mechanics but the answer to the third one is C.

467
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:51,417
你这绝对是瞎蒙的
That's plain guesswork.

468
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:54,126
不是，我看过这个问题
I am not guessing. I have seen this question.

469
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,167
是的，我也很熟悉
Yes, it appears familiar to me as well..

470
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,417
但我已经忘了怎么做了
..but I've forgotten how it is done.

471
00:29:58,876 --> 00:30:01,251
如果有人能给我讲一下就好了
It is okay. If anyone explains a little to me once..

472
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,542
你想再出去问一圈吗？
We got ourselves embarrassed just now. You want to go again?

473
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,333
我以为人们来到科塔就会成为天才
I thought people come to Kota and become geniuses.

474
00:30:08,834 --> 00:30:10,001
淦！
Jackasses!

475
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,876
好主意！
Idea!

476
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:17,001
同学们，我们今天要解一个比较棘手的题
Kids, we will solve a tricky question today..

477
00:30:17,126 --> 00:30:20,084
如果这道题不使用这个技巧
..and if you don't use the trick in this question..

478
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,751
就会很难解
..it will be difficult for you to solve this question.

479
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:24,792
如你所见，这里有方块和弹簧
As you can see a block and spring system has been used here.

480
00:30:24,876 --> 00:30:28,042
我以V0速度
Here I have projected the back block..

481
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:33,751
将后面的方块移到到前面。-就是这个。
..towards the front block with V0 velocity. - This is the one.

482
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:35,292
弹簧会自动的……
The spring with the natural ability.

483
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,709
往前一点
Go a little forward. A little forward. A little forward.

484
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:41,251
现在你必须用质心来解这个问题
Now you have to solve this with center of mass.

485
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,501
如果你用质心来解这个问题...-是的，这就是答案了
If you solve this with center of mass.. - Yes, this is the answer.

486
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:47,001
我们被题干的描述干扰了
We were fooled by the change of language of the question.

487
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:52,584
当我们必须取质心时，我们用了地面作为参考系
We took the frame of reference of ground when we had to take center of mass.

488
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:57,084
你看看，米纳，我可不像你，你忘了
You see, Meena. I'm not like you. You forget.

489
00:30:57,376 --> 00:30:59,792
我的讲座可以随时观看
My lectures can be revised anywhere and at any time.

490
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:01,459
嗯，好
Yes. Alright.

491
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:04,083
怎么了？
What?

492
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,583
如果有一道题是雷斯尼克 · 哈利迪出的
If one problem is from Resnick Halliday..

493
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,083
那其他的题可能也都是来自某一本书
..then all the others too can be from some book or the other.

494
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,516
不要仔细读，先留意图形
Don't start reading the text. Look out for the figure first.

495
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,876
如果你找到了对应的，那就读一下问题，这样可以节省时间
If you find the figure, then read the question. It will save time.

496
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:32,876
我找到那个气泡了！
I found the bubble one!

497
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:37,584
表面张力等于……-以后再读，先抄下来
Surface tension equated with.. - Read it later. Just copy it now.

498
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:43,459
再拿些书来
Bring more books.

499
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:03,376
这叫什么事啊
These are bad times.

500
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,917
我们还得偷偷溜出去学习
We have to sneak out for studies.

501
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,083
求上帝把我们从印度理工拯救出来吧
God save us from IIT.

502
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:36,126
“没有朋友的生活有什么意义? ”
"What good is a life with no friends?"

503
00:32:47,459 --> 00:32:49,876
我中枪了救救我 - 救我
I've been shot.Help me.. -- Revive me.

504
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,783
杀了他，杀了他
Kill him. Kill him.

505
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:53,825
他躲在灌木丛里
He's hiding in the bushes.

506
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,059
过来帮帮我
Come help me.

507
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:57,709
我怎么过去？
How do I come?

508
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,376
快点过来
Please come now.

509
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:02,583
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

510
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:08,417
“它由你的爱和你的崇拜组成”
"It is made up of your love and your worship."

511
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:12,001
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

512
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:17,626
“我见过几千人，但只有四个好朋友”
"I have met several thousand but I have only four good friends."

513
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:22,583
“这是每个人的路，这是每个人的呼唤”
"This is everyone's path. This is everyone's calling."

514
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:27,667
“没有朋友的生活有什么意义? ”
"What good is a life with no friends?"

515
00:33:28,126 --> 00:33:32,084
“别迷路，别走散了”
"Don't get lost. Don't get separated."

516
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:34,417
“别再迷路了”
"Don't get lost again."

517
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,751
拿去，全都拿去
Take them. Take them all.

518
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:38,959
我要这书有何用
These books are of no use.

519
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:40,708
我还想为了她考上印度理工
The one for whom I wanted to crack IIT..

520
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,917
她竟然和一个小贩跑了
..she eloped with a commerce guy.

521
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,001
我们只需要解题
We only need the solution.

522
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,459
这是旧版本啊？
Old edition?

523
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:50,834
没问题，没问题，没问题
It will do. It will do. It will do.

524
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:54,501
拜拜，兄弟
Bye. Bye. Bye, bro.

525
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:04,792
“没有悲伤，没有大麻，也没有朗姆酒”
"No sorrow, no cannabis or your rum."

526
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,751
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

527
00:34:10,126 --> 00:34:14,459
“我以前在书上读到过，现在写在墙上了”
"I had read it in books. Now it is written on the walls."

528
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:17,875
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

529
00:34:19,292 --> 00:34:23,125
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

530
00:34:23,876 --> 00:34:27,167
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

531
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:31,584
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

532
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:37,469
你有钥匙！
YOU have the keys!!

533
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:40,826
太棒了
Oh yeah!!

534
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:54,875
“我以前在书上读到过，现在写在墙上了”
"I had read it in books. Now it is written on the walls."

535
00:34:55,042 --> 00:34:58,292
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

536
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:03,125
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

537
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:08,042
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

538
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:13,084
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

539
00:35:13,834 --> 00:35:17,459
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

540
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:22,376
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

541
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:27,209
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

542
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,834
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

543
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:36,500
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

544
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,417
够了
Enough already.

545
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,750
解出这么多题一定不是A10组的水平了
You will surely get a better batch than A10 with this much.

546
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,709
这都是抄来的的，让我自己解几个
This is copied. Let me solve a few myself.

547
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:52,417
嘿，兄弟，别告诉杰图老师这些都是你抄的
Hey, bro. Don't tell Jeetu Bhaiya that you copied all these.

548
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:54,542
别为了这几道题
You will waste the whole night's efforts..

549
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,917
让这一晚的努力全白费了
..just for a couple of questions.

550
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:00,376
我要去睡觉了
I am going to bed now.

551
00:36:01,042 --> 00:36:02,292
你还不睡吗？
How much longer will you remain awake?

552
00:36:03,209 --> 00:36:04,542
差不多了，再让我看一会
It's almost done. Only a little longer.

553
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,792
- 祝你好运-好的兄弟，谢谢了
Good luck. - Yes, bro. Thank you.

554
00:36:16,376 --> 00:36:17,542
- 再见-好
Bye. - Yes.

555
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,167
这些都是你做的？
You did all of these?

556
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,251
是的，先生，我花了一整晚
Yes, sir. It took me all night.

557
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:56,750
你是怎么解的？
How did you do this one?

558
00:36:58,126 --> 00:36:59,376
第三题
The third one?

559
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:03,792
我们不用地面，而是用质心作为参考系
Sir, Instead of ground we had to use center of mass as the frame of reference.

560
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,709
然后答案就出来了
Then it got done.

561
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:09,125
正确
Correct.

562
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:12,584
这个题呢？
This one?

563
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,667
先生，这道题的第一部分很简单
Sir, the first part in this one was very easy.

564
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:20,125
第二部分改变了惯性运动
In the second part the movement of inertia was changed.

565
00:37:20,459 --> 00:37:22,084
然后就有答案了
Then it got done.

566
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,084
这个？
This one?

567
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:34,334
在这个过程中要把空气吹成气泡，然后表面张力
In this one had to blow air into a bubble. Then the surface tension..

568
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:36,959
加倍了-加倍了，是的，老师
You must have doubled it. - Doubled. Yes, sir.

569
00:37:37,126 --> 00:37:38,792
那你一定把它等同了-是的，先生
Then you must have equated it. - Yes, sir.

570
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:41,334
正确
It's correct.

571
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:43,625
你的方法是正确的-谢谢老师
Your method is correct. - Thank you, sir.

572
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:47,376
但答案是错误的
But the answer is wrong.

573
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,167
典型的计算错误
Classic calculation mistake.

574
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:53,125
无独有偶，沙玛先生的解题方法中也犯了同样的错误
Coincidentally Sharma sir's solution has the same mistake.

575
00:37:54,042 --> 00:37:57,542
最后一版，第98页，第17题
In the last edition. Page number 98, problem number 17.

576
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:03,001
我给他发了邮件，他会在下一版中更正的
I mailed him. He will correct it in the next edition.

577
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,084
你知道为什么剩下的8道题你解不出来吗？
Do you know why you couldn't solve the remaining 8 questions?

578
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,750
因为这8道题是我设计的
Because those 8 questions were framed by me.

579
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,792
其他问题的答案都在这本或那本书里
The solutions for the other questions are in one book or another.

580
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:22,501
那些你已经解决的问题
Those you have solved.

581
00:38:24,126 --> 00:38:25,709
你不可能一个晚上就做到这种程度
You couldn't complete these by yourself in one night.

582
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,125
谁和你一起做的？
Who was with you?

583
00:38:31,126 --> 00:38:32,292
谁和你一起？
Who was with you?

584
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,584
我最后一次问你，这些题都是你解出来的吗？
I'm asking you for the last time. Did you solve these?

585
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,626
不是的
No, sir.

586
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:41,667
我只解出了基础题
I had only solved NCERT so far.

587
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:43,500
昨天的勇气呢？
Didn't you know this yesterday?

588
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,709
昨天你的行为就像科吉利瓦（德里首席部长）
Yesterday you were acting like Kejriwal.

589
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,167
给我一个机会吧，我一定会做到的
Give me one opportunity, sir. Give me a chance. I will do it.

590
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,334
结果怎么样？
What happened?

591
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,667
对不起，先生
Sorry, sir.

592
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:55,250
你知道指标、教室、教材
Do you know for whom quota, coaching, material..

593
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:58,709
. . DPP，试卷和现成的计算器这些都是为谁设计的吗？
..DPP, sheets and ready reckoner are designed for?

594
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:01,417
-给学生-给骗子！
For the students. - For rankers.

595
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:07,709
不是给我们的，我们只是复印，而我们得到了什么？费用！
It's not for us? We only copy. What do we have? Fees.

596
00:39:08,709 --> 00:39:10,875
校长就靠着你们这些学生
The rankers get facilities from fees charged to students like you..

597
00:39:11,042 --> 00:39:12,417
还有像我这样的老师来赚钱
..and people like me make an earning.

598
00:39:13,376 --> 00:39:15,209
像你这样的人来到科塔
Guys like you come to Kota.

599
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:18,209
9年级玩口袋妖怪，10年级玩吃鸡
Playing pokemon in 9th grade.. ..and PUBG in 10th grade and

600
00:39:18,542 --> 00:39:19,750
11年级来到科塔
Kota in 11th grade.

601
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:23,584
为什么? 等沙玛先生问了再说
Why? We will answer when Mr. Sharma asks.

602
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,542
你们正在科塔准备IIT 和 NEET的考试
You are preparing for IIT and NEET in Kota.

603
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,792
它看起来很酷，只是一时的流行
It looks cool. It's a fad.

604
00:39:28,376 --> 00:39:30,667
你看报纸上的广告，还有路边的广告牌
You read the ads in newspapers and see the hoardings..

605
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:32,209
保证100% 的学生都能考上
..that state 100 percent selection guaranteed.

606
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:34,584
我们也作出了100% 的入学保证
We claim the same. 100 percent selection guaranteed.

607
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:38,459
现在你也看到了，你来到这里根本就没有保证
You see that and you come here. There is no guarantee.

608
00:39:41,084 --> 00:39:42,500
我不是在训斥你，我在给你讲道理，坐下
I am not reprimanding you. I am opening your eyes. Sit.

609
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:44,625
坐
Sit.

610
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:49,001
你来到科塔是为了什么？
You came to Kota, didn't you? Why?

611
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:50,417
来学习
To study, sir.

612
00:39:50,542 --> 00:39:53,000
你也可以在家学啊？科塔有什么不一样的？
You could have studied at home. What will Kota do?

613
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,834
想想，给你时间思考一下
Think. Think. This will take time.

614
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:03,917
科塔提供了一个环境，因为到处都是学生
Kota provides an environment. Since there are students everywhere..

615
00:40:06,459 --> 00:40:12,000
有竞争和焦点，所以我们应该能考上
..there is competition and focus. So we ought to get selected.

616
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:13,417
如果你没考上呢？
And what if you don't?

617
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:16,834
老师，即使没考上也没关系
Sir, even if one is not selected it doesn't matter.

618
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,501
学生必须要完成12年的学习
One has to study for the 12th grade, sir.

619
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,334
来这里学习没有任何损失，老师
It gets done from here. There is no loss, sir.

620
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:24,209
有，有损失，这就是人们无法理解的
There is. There is a loss. That's what people don't understand.

621
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,084
2年后你们离开科塔
Children leave Kota in 2 years..

622
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,792
但是科塔这么多年从来就不缺少学生
..but Kota doesn't leave the children for years.

623
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,959
来到科塔会怎样? 它把你和世界隔离开来
What does Kota do? It isolates you from the world.

624
00:40:33,542 --> 00:40:36,167
那么哪个政府垮台了……
Then it doesn't matter in life which government crashed..

625
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:37,564
谁和谁结婚了，谁赢得了 IPL
..who got married to whom and who won the IPL.

626
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:39,588
这些都不再重要了
None of it matters in life.

627
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:45,167
父母，兄弟姐妹，朋友和亲戚，所有的一切都离你而去
Parents, siblings, friends and relatives. Everything is left behind.

628
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,167
剩下你一个人在这里
And you are left here alone.

629
00:40:47,626 --> 00:40:50,792
还剩下什么? 印度理工，翻来覆去都是印度理工
What is left? IIT. You keep harping about IIT over here.

630
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:54,876
在你这个年纪，当你如此渴望某样东西的时候
When you desire something so much at your tender age..

631
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:56,250
只有两种结果
..there are only two outcomes.

632
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,125
考上了，你就平静了，舒服了
If you get in then you have peace. You're chilled.

633
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:04,250
如果没考上，那就只有嫉妒，仇恨和自我怀疑
And if you don't get in you wind up being jealous, rancour and self-doubt.

634
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,000
人在失去信心之后
One loses confidence, brother.

635
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:10,619
就会认为自己是世界上最失败的人
Then a person deems himself a bigger loser than the world does.

636
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,709
一旦失去了信心，无论你进入一所多么好的大学
After that no matter how good a college you get into..

637
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:18,917
你都不会喜欢，因为它不是印度理工学院
..you don't like it because it is not IIT.

638
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,459
七年！四年毕业，三年工作
Seven years. 4 years of graduation and 3 years of working.

639
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,959
这种创伤需要7年的时间才能痊愈
It takes 7 years to come out of this trauma.

640
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:31,084
你知道印度对欺诈罪的惩罚吗？
Do you know the punishment for fraud in India?

641
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:36,542
最高判7年，正因如此，从今以后，不要再作弊了
7 years. So henceforth stop all this fraud.

642
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:40,917
这里不是你的学校，得高分就能获得老师的关注
This is not your school where you impress someone to get more marks.

643
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,625
在这里，我和你要齐心协力才能让你考上印度理工
Here you and I have to get together to help you get selected.

644
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,542
靠抄袭和死记硬背，你是不可能考上的
You won't achieve that in this manner. By copying and cramming.

645
00:41:52,584 --> 00:41:54,000
电影里都是骗人的
What they show in the films is wrong.

646
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:55,917
通过死记硬背考上了
People getting selected by cramming.

647
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,584
查图尔考不上印度理工，兰乔才行
It's not the Chaturs who go to IIT. Only Ranchos do.

648
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,042
你看过《三个白痴》对吧？
You have seen 3 Idiots, haven't you?

649
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:09,084
不要再纠结你的分组了，接受吧
Don't be afraid of the batch. This is your truth. Accept it.

650
00:42:09,542 --> 00:42:10,750
好的，老师
Yes, sir.

651
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,450
啥啥不会
0/10 for knowledge

652
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,334
你一个晚上就把《机械力学》全部复习了一遍，这也是事实
It is also true that you brushed up entire Mechanics in one night.

653
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:38,042
所以，你肯定是一个斗士学生
So, you are certainly a fighter student.

654
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,542
这正是一个老师想要的
And that is all a teacher wants.

655
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,425
啥啥不会，态度还行，孺子可教，升级A5
0/10 for knowledge, 10/10 for efforts

656
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:56,626
你来晚了，所以有些落后
You joined late hence you are lagging behind.

657
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:58,334
但你并不孤单
..but you are not alone.

658
00:42:59,126 --> 00:43:02,334
我们将战斗到最后一刻，战胜理工学院
We will fight right up till the last moment and crack IIT.

659
00:43:03,251 --> 00:43:04,376
好吗？
Okay?

660
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,292
回答是或不是
Say yes or no.

661
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:09,626
是，先生
Yes, sir.

662
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:12,876
去吧
Go.

663
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:15,167
把这个交给接待员，她快下班了
Give this to the receptionist. She will leave anytime.

664
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:16,417
好的
Yes, sir.

665
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:22,334
先生
Sir.

666
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,917
剩下的8道题应该怎么解？
How do I solve the remaining eight questions?

667
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:27,959
来吧，还有很多人有同样的问题
Come. The repeater batch has the same topic going on.

668
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:30,334
来吧
Come on.
