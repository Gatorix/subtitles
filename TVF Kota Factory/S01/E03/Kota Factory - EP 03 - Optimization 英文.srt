1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,200
You done? - Yes. Almost.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,910
Hurry up. Hurry up.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,330
Today we'll reach early and take the front row.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,330
After so long I've completed the DPP.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,450
Batla sir is right.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,620
If one knows inorganic the questions get solved instantly. - Yes.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,370
Lord knows why they teach SPDF orbital.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,330
They should begin with Inorganic.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,910
That ways student's confidence will get a boost. - Yes.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,250
For the first time I could finish the DPP in fifteen mins.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,910
I finished in twelve.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,410
Well, it's possible you made some mistakes in haste.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,330
Wait for it to be discussed. - Really?

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,910
Well, alright. We shall see.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,910
The one who has more correct answers..

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,330
..has to treat the other to Shreeji's onion puffs.

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,910
It's a bet. - It's a bet.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,290
You will lose. - Come. Come. Come.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,040
You have to do something. It took you 15 minutes.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,660
One should take time but do it perfectly.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,790
Vaibhav Pandey!

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,540
Yes, aunty.

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,000
Vaibhav Pandey. - Yes, aunty.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,620
Your fan was left on yesterday. - No, aunty. The fan was off.

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,700
It was on! - Maybe it was left on.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,790
Aunty, the fan was off. - Don't tell lies.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,450
I could hear the fan on full speed all the way up.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,910
Aunty, when the sound of our fan can't be heard our room. - Yes.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
How can the sound of our fan be heard in your room?

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
Don't apply your physics in this matter..

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,500
..because if the fan is left on again..

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,500
..I shall apply my math and increase 200 rupees in the rent next month.

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,200
Bunty!

34
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,500
Aunty. List..

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,500
Old hag! She is demanding money whilst brushing her teeth.

37
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,250
So give her the money. - It's not about the money.

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,700
Lalita Pawar!

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,790
In dad's presence she was acting like Nirupa Roy.

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,160
He is like my Bunty.

41
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,540
I like.. Damn!

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,250
Even if I have to sleep with the fan off..

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,830
..I won't give her an excuse to increase the rent.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,660
Okay. You can think about Tarka later.

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,660
Let's sit in the first bench now and show them.

46
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,620
Only ten minutes left in class.

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,620
Everybody pay attention.

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,910
This is a very important exception.

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,660
It was asked in JEE 2005.

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,200
Silver Iodide is an ionic compound still it's not soluble in water.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,830
Why? Because Fajan's rule applies here.

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
What was it? - No ionic compound is completely ionic..

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,750
..and no covalent compound is completely covalent.

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,080
Very good!

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,620
Right, Meenal. You see..

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,130
Just like that your rank just rose by 500

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,700
and you move from Computer Science in IIT BHU to Metallurgy IIT Bombay.

58
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,080
Look, its Inorganic that improves rank.

59
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,540
What was your rank, sir?

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,950
What? DPP.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,040
Yes, yes. Let's do DPP.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,500
All of you bring it out. Come on.

63
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,500
Get this repaired.

64
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,250
This is most important. - Yes, sir.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Please continue.

66
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,250
These are the faculty feedback forms.

67
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,370
Fill if you care to and return them in two days.

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,790
And only five days remain towards the third installment.

69
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,120
And the next lecture will also be given by Batla.... sir.

70
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,830
As you might be knowing Bansal sir has gone to Romania for the Math Olympiad.

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,620
Abroad? - Yes.

72
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,810
And you. Get a haircut.

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
Where are you loitering?

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,660
Yes. So, let's do the DPP. - Yes, sir!

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,700
Good! I like excited state.

76
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,080
Good!

77
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:46,120
Yes. So, the first answer is A.

78
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,580
The second answer is C.

79
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,660
The third answer is D.

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
The fourth answer is

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,540
B.

82
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,830
The sixth answer is C.

83
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,540
B.

84
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,080
C.

85
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,000
Now write your marks on the DPP.

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,950
And keep them away for revision.

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
And what about the 15th, sir.

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,700
That is a chocolate problem.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I included that exclusively for the A1 batch. You skip it.

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,750
Okay, sir. - Sir! Sir!

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,000
Sir, how can the answer to the 14th question be C?

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,910
Sir, this cannot become a compound.

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,450
The octet rule will break here.

94
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,250
Yes. You are absolutely correct.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,120
So? - This is an exception, son.

96
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,830
Exception?

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,250
But, sir, rules cannot break in science.

98
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,790
Who told you that?

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,000
Exception is the rule of chemistry.

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,330
Got it?

101
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,910
Come on. Let's start salt analysis. Sit down. Sit down.

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,660
Sit down.

103
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,790
Okay, so. Pay attention. Everybody listen.

104
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,790
It's very important.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
Why are you laughing? You got three answers correct.

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
You got two. Puffs.

107
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,370
We took this very lightly, bro.

108
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,700
Thought it's a piece of cake . It isn't. - Yes, bro. It's certainly not a piece of cake.

109
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,950
It is extremely spicy today, bro.

110
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,540
Water.

111
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,910
Water.

112
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,620
Brother. Water.

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,620
Here. Have this.

114
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,870
Hold this.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,450
Easy. Easy.

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,870
Okay?

117
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,750
May I have it all? - You may.

118
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,370
Just give me the wrapper. - Thank you.

119
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,620
Wrapper?

120
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,950
He must be eco-friendly.

121
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,500
Very promising.

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,750
No, no. These are not wrappers. They are my trophies.

123
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,620
My fourth chocolate problem.

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,950
You can solve the chocolate problem?

125
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,000
You are in A6, aren't you? - So?

126
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,830
Not just me. Five others have also done it.

127
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,870
What are you saying? - Exactly, don't do it. It is only for the A1 batch.

128
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,200
Give me the wrapper.

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,500
Bro.

130
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,950
So, how much.. Not that it matters to me.

131
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,450
How much do you score in Inorganic DPP?

132
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,200
In inorganic?

133
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,700
About 12 or 13.

134
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,870
You?

135
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,660
13 or 14 types.

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,040
Yes. 13 or 14.

137
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,040
Very promising! Very promising!

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450
These people can solve the chocolate problem.

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,790
What is different in their A6 from our A5?

140
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,950
The color of the walls. The width of the benches.

141
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,870
The number of fans.

142
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,790
Also, the faculty.

143
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,620
Why?

144
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,370
Come. I'll tell you.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,540
Come. Come. Come.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,910
What are you doing? Are you insane?

147
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,580
Give him zero. Zero.

148
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,870
If Batla's teaching isn't up to the mark..

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
..what will we give him in the feedback form?

150
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,790
We will give him a zero, won't we?

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,250
Awarding bad marks and humiliating thereafter suits teachers, not students.

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,410
That too from A5.

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,200
You dork! If we don't give bad feedback..

154
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,580
..he only will continue to teach.

155
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,040
Then how will you learn inorganic?

156
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,040
Teachers are equal to parents.

157
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,790
Then you should give them feedback too.

158
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,040
Dad, you are not up to the mark as a father.

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,410
Hereafter uncle will sleep in your bedroom.

160
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,040
That doesn't make sense. Cool down.

161
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,080
Go and switch on the fan.

162
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,250
The fan won't be switched on today.

163
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,000
But I am feeling a little hot.

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,160
Fill the form first. Then the fan will be switched on.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,330
I am going to drink water.

166
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,120
Meena!

167
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
There was this 'Dwapar' era..

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,370
..when Gurus like Dronacharya used to be respected.

169
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,120
And here is this era.. - Hey! Even Arjun fought Dronacharya.

170
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,120
Even your Ramayana is weak..

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,410
..where as Dronacharya sir was like the best teacher ever.

172
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,830
Bestest teacher ever!

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,830
And yet he fought with him. Why?

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,540
For seizure of a plot.

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,120
And you, Meena, can't even fill a single feedback form against Batla for JEE.

176
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,120
If it were me, I'd have leapt from here.

177
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,080
Go ahead. Give him bad marks. I won't do it.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,410
Okay.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,750
Okay. Fine. Fine.

180
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,330
You'll also rot in some private engineering college like that Batla of yours.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,540
Bloody non-IITians.

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,790
Hey!

183
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,580
What's going on? - Nothing, aunty.

184
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,950
I felt a spray of water.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
You are playing holi with drinking water?

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,830
You are right, aunt. - No, aunty. We were simply.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,830
300 rupees will be increased.

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,830
Aunty. Aunty. - Bunty!

189
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,950
Aunty, listen to me. Aunty!

190
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,120
I am just like your Bunty.

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,080
Mummy!

192
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
I will fill water from the neighboring institute.

193
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,870
But will not pay this witch! Bloody grouch.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,040
Take this. I've signed it.

195
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,160
Fill what you want in it. Son of a witch!

196
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,410
Sorry, pal. - It's okay, bro.

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,870
'Only a cloud understands the thirst of the Earth.'

198
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,410
Hey, Kumar Vishwas! Come. - Where?

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,000
Come along.

200
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,410
We have given it..

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,370
..but Batla will only be removed when everyone gives bad feedback.

202
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,250
"What good is a life with no friends?"

203
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,500
Take this, bro. I filled the form.

204
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
Remove that scoundrel Chauhan!

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,580
The faculty's name is Batla.

206
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,580
Chauhan sir teaches in A2, not in A5.

207
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,950
Oh crap! I've fallen till A5?

208
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,290
"Not by maps, not by religion or by need."

209
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,450
"My world is made up of friends."

210
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,910
"Made up of your love, your sound and your worship."

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,870
"My world is made up of friends."

212
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,000
Just a minute.

213
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,040
No. Neither will I give a negative feedback and nor will let you give it.

214
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,870
Why? Is he your uncle? - Yes!

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,540
He is your uncle? - Yes.

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,250
Family? - Yes. Family.

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,540
Look, bro. Teaching style.. Batla? - Zero.

218
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,000
Two. Two. Let's give the poor chap two.

219
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
Doubt solving. - Zero!

220
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
One. One. One.

221
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,870
Personality. - Zero!

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Zero. Zero. Zero.

223
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,500
And punctuality. - Nil.

224
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,000
Sorry. I revise my periodic table once daily before lunch and after dinner.

225
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,330
That's nice.

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,830
Very nice!

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,410
The form? - Oh, feedback form!

228
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,850
I am doing well in Inorganic so, no need for me to fill it up.

229
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,830
Well, bye. I have to revise all the atomic radii too.

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,750
Let's go, Vaibhav. Come.

231
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,750
We are in A5 but we are not destined..

232
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,580
..to be able to solve the chocolate problem like the A6 students.

233
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,000
What did you say?

234
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,250
Very nice initiative!

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,290
Batla should be changed.

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,330
In fact, every teacher in this coaching class should be changed.

237
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,950
No, no. This coaching industry should change.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,330
Exam pattern, syllabus, curriculum. Pedagogy should change.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,330
IIT should change. This whole educational system should change.

240
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
And for that..

241
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,330
..patriarchy should change.

242
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,160
What do you think, Shivangi?

243
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,160
I think you should attend class first.

244
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,370
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. Inorganic.

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,290
What is AWS under inorganic?

246
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,160
Awasthi. Will he teach us now? - What? Batla is gone?

247
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
He acted very respectable.

248
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,700
He isn't gone. He has been removed.

249
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,620
Uncle.

250
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,790
Mr. Batla. - Hi.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,540
How are you? - Yes. Sit. Sit. Sit.

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,000
So, tell me. What brings you here?

253
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,500
I just wanted to talk to you, sir.

254
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,790
Yes, yes. Tell me. - Sir, I've lost A5.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes. - If you could let me give extra classes to resolve doubts..

256
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,910
Doubt classes that too of Inorganic? Who will attend, sir?

257
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,750
Just don't decrease my salary. I will do anything.

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,540
Give me a junior class if you wish.

259
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,500
I can even teach 8th grade physics.

260
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,700
How can you say that, sir? You are respectable to us, sir.

261
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,580
Not true, sir. The other subjects are respected..

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,580
..when inorganic demands the most hard work. - Yes.

263
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,450
One has to revise every morning.

264
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,660
Yet the others have better salaries.

265
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,370
Look, sir. Math and Physics are taught by IITians.

266
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,000
Pay less to them and other institutes poach them.

267
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,750
That's why brother-in-law pays them so much.

268
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,250
What can I do in this matter, sir?

269
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,250
I could only offer your nephew a scholarship. Did I or didn't I?

270
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,040
Yes, sir.

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
When in fact, he didn't deserve it.

272
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,040
But, sir, even if I was to be removed Mr. Rao. would've been a respectable replacement.

273
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,830
Or maybe that teacher of A6. Parminder.

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,120
Even he would have been a better option.

275
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,120
But sir, you replaced me with my junior.

276
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,830
You know what, sir? He is a psycho.

277
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,830
He doesn't know anything. He used to attend my lectures.

278
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,620
In that case, sir, even you made a mistake, didn't you?

279
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,500
Junior and senior don't matter in inorganic, sir.

280
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,540
Someone had to be retained. So, we did.

281
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,620
And that poor chap will be a psycho.

282
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,370
He too has been idling at home for the past 4 months.

283
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,370
He can idle another four months. He owns two hostels.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,790
Tell me something, sir. If he was a true teacher..

285
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,910
..wouldn't he join some coaching institute by now?

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Why are you making fun of the poor chap, sir?

287
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,950
Even you are aware no institute poaches Inorganic faculty.

288
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,500
Up! Stand up quickly!

289
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,500
What have you studied till date if you don't know this exception?

290
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Call your family today and tell them you won't be able to crack IIT.

291
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,800
And if you don't have the courage to tell them, then download 'tic tok'.

292
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,500
Many jerks like you dance there and even earn more than they deserve.

293
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,910
I'll be your first customer. Take this!

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,410
You scored four out of fifteen.

295
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,790
Sir, do you discuss the chocolate problems? - Yes, yes.

296
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,040
Of course I do. - So what is the reason for this exception...

297
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,030
But only with A1 batch students.

298
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,830
..because they don't ask stupid questions like A5 students.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,830
These are facts, information. But no!

300
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,700
"We want logic."

301
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,290
Sir, why do notes only come in 100 and 50 rupee denominations?

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,660
Why not 75?

303
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,870
Why did Ranbir choose Alia? Why not Deepika?

304
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,250
Simply memorize what's written and be done with it.

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,830
But no! "We want logic. We want to be toppers."

306
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,330
"Sir, do you know why I am a topper from A5 and not from A1?

307
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,450
Because I am an ass."

308
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,560
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,830
If you want to learn inorganic then you do as I tell you.

310
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,830
Keep memorizing it. That's that!

311
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,830
No questions asked.

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
Everyone got it!? - Yes, sir!

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,160
Say it aloud. - Yes, sir!

314
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,330
I can't hear you. - Yes, sir!

315
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,790
Good!

316
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,500
Now some questions from JEE '97.

317
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,700
We shall solve them.

318
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,200
They're really important for you guys.

319
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,200
Remove your note books.

320
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,000
Sir, we have a request.

321
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,000
Have you paid the installment? - We paid it, sir!

322
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,830
We paid it long ago.

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,330
Okay, talk.

324
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,580
Sir, you..

325
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,500
Sir, can the Inorganic faculty be changed once again?

326
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,500
Yes.

327
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,910
Why not?

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
Fill the feedback form next year.

329
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,500
It'll be changed.

330
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,790
Sir. Next year will be too late, sir.

331
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,950
Why don't you reinstate Batla sir?

332
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,620
You worthless chaps should never be given the feedback forms.

333
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,620
The toppers never make any fuss.

334
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,950
Get out!

335
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,250
They want to be IITians.

336
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
Meenal is also frustrated, sir.

337
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,290
What happened to her? - Hee-haw. Hee-haw.

338
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,040
Call Meenal.

339
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,790
You idiot! Give it to me!

340
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,420
I've told you so many times you should know topper's phone numbers by heart.

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,450
Hello. Oh sweet child Meenal.

342
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,850
(sobs)

343
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,700
Is there any... problem with the new sir?

344
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,370
(sobs)

345
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,830
Tell me, child.

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,660
Yes, sir. A little bit.

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,660
Then why did you wait? You are this year's topper.

348
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,230
Topper?

349
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,140
- Girls topper.

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,250
If anything happens, you should message me immediately.

351
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,410
That's why you have my personal number.

352
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,200
Yes, sir. I changed my phone so, your number got misplaced.

353
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,200
Take it down.

354
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,000
9-8-6-2...

355
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,190
I'll give it to you later.

356
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,910
Okay.

357
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,290
Put Awasthi in the foundation course.

358
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,250
Tell me. Which sir would you like?

359
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,120
The teacher from A6.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,330
Yes. The teacher from A6.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,790
The teacher from A6.

362
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,040
Par...min...der.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
Okay - Yes.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Okay.

365
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Look. She is this dude's girlfriend..

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,540
..but who all are chasing her? All the boys in Kota?

367
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,410
The boys from where? - Boys in Kota!

368
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,830
But dude's girlfriend refuses everyone except 'the dude'.

369
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,120
So what does that make the dude? - Exception.

370
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,000
And what does that make the girlfriend?

371
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,830
Innocent. She fell for that jerk!

372
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,410
We must understand the gist of the matter.

373
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,540
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

374
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,080
Very good! This is fun.

375
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,000
So the dude sees me outside the class and says Inorganic chemistry is dangerous.

376
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,450
It is very complicated.

377
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,830
I will quit.

378
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,620
I said, brother, your girlfriend is also complicated.

379
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,140
Do you leave her?

380
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,710
No. What do you do with her? You pay her attention.

381
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,910
You focus on her. You talk to her nicely.

382
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,370
Shona. Mona. Babu. Jadu. Tona.

383
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,120
What else do you call?

384
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,250
Look at that. On hearing it even the Bajrang dal at the back is attentive.

385
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,830
Hello. Sit straight.

386
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,160
Yes.

387
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,370
You find it very amusing, bro.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,700
Stand up.

389
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,620
You have a girlfriend?

390
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,580
You don't. That's not surprising.

391
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,750
Sit down.

392
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,040
Just as our brother here is alone, similarly boron is alone.

393
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,870
Boron is short of electrons but nobody is giving it.

394
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,910
So, what will we do?

395
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,540
Will it remain alone?

396
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,870
Is our brother sitting alone? No.

397
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,290
Brother found a monkey just like him.

398
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,790
What did he find? - Monkey!

399
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,160
Friend. Only I will say monkey.

400
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,040
So the boron finds boron like itself..

401
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,450
..and forms a bond with it.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,200
Not James Bond. Bond.

403
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,040
When two friends make a bond what is it called?

404
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,500
It will become a banana, sir.

405
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,830
Very good answer!

406
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,080
It will form a banana bond.

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,910
The educated people call it three-center to two electron bond.

408
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,080
What is it called? - Three-center to two electron bond!

409
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,910
No need to remember that. It will not help you clear IIT.

410
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,660
What do we want to clear? - IIT!

411
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,040
Very good!

412
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,540
So you two. Have you formed a bond?

413
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,160
Have you formed a bond?

414
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,000
Come on. Write in your book.

415
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,870
When two atoms combine to form a bond of similar type..

416
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
..due to lack of electrons, the bond is known as banana bond.

417
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,660
Children, if there is any question on banana bond, we will do it?

418
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,410
Yes, sir!

419
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,790
That means banana bond? - Is not a problem.

420
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,660
The bell has rung.

421
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,660
Everyone will complete their sheets and bring them in tomorrow.

422
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,080
Those who don't complete it will get a punch from me. Okay?

423
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,950
Bye. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Let's have a song.

424
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,950
A song, sir.

425
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,950
Yes, sir. A song, sir.

426
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,660
Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.

427
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,950
Silence!

428
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,750
Are you here to listen to songs? I sing songs?

429
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
Is this 'Indian Idol'?

430
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,000
Is this why your parents pay your fees?

431
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,830
Sing a song, sir. Sing a song.

432
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,080
He explains so well. He made it so easy.

433
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,700
Apart from being the best teacher he is the best singer also.

434
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,370
The boys from A6 said so.

435
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,370
But they never said he makes you laugh so much too. - That's right.

436
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,250
I swear if he wasn't a teacher he would surely do stand up comedy.

437
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,370
Praise the lord. Its like we got the 'Jeetu Bhaiya' of Inorganic chemistry. - Yes.

438
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,950
I remember the whole lecture vividly.

439
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,200
I won't have to refer to my notes to do the DPP.

440
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,330
It's nice. He teaches us while singing. That's how the class should be.

441
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,120
Today my brain has opened to chemistry.

442
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,120
It's already open. - It has opened today.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,870
The door is already open.

444
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,120
Clean all the cobwebs from here.

445
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,040
Move the suitcases and throw away all the garbage.

446
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,660
Welcome, prince.

447
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
It seems to me I'll have to cut money from your security now.

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
What happened now, aunty? - What is this?

449
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,750
The floor.

450
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,700
What is on the floor? - You.

451
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
You are being a wise ass.

452
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,450
What kind of stains are those? Crispy. Crispy.

453
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,450
Even lizol can't remove these.

454
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,790
I am warning you. I am warning you I don't want even a scratch on my Kota marble.

455
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,160
This is not Kota marble. It is Kota stone.

456
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,250
What did you say to my face?

457
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,370
Aunty, hereafter we shall take more care of your marble than our books.

458
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,370
Oh, no.

459
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,370
Hereafter we will have daily cleaning here..

460
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,370
..and you will have to pay 500 rupees per month for it.

461
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,080
Let's go.

462
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,370
Hey! - Get out of my way. You don't even shower.

463
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,030
'Aunty, give me hot water.'

464
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,940
Filthy rascals.

465
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,000
I wish I had a feedback form for this Tarka as well.

466
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Never mind Supankha. You are a hero.

467
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,290
If it hadn't been for you neither would the inorganic teacher change..

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,910
..nor would my luck.

469
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
Brother, I will give you my first two chocolates as offerings.

470
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,040
Its alright, junior.

471
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,160
Come on, children. Remove your sheets. We shall begin now.

472
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,200
I will tell you the answers. Check your answers.

473
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,000
The first. Very easy question. It's a shame to even discuss it.

474
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,000
The answer is A. Mark it and move on. Tally it.

475
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,700
Tell me the second. B. ZnS.

476
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,200
Which of you have done the third? It is a very easy question.

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,040
We shall solve it orally. Its a shame if you use your pens.

478
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,200
The answer is B.

479
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,250
What is this? Such easy questions. Time waste.

480
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
Even more basic question. C is the answer.

481
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,470
If you got this wrong, get yourself checked.

482
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,090
Question number 4.

483
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,690
The answer is B. Very basic.

484
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,750
The answer is C. I did it in the last class.

485
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,660
You should have no problem.

486
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,620
Sixth question. Let's go to the eighth question. - Sir!

487
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,200
Sir. How can the answer to question 7 be A? - Son, that..

488
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,750
It should be C, shouldn't it? - Let's complete this and then I will..

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,410
No, no, sir. Tell me this first.

490
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,250
Sir, aluminum is from the boron family.

491
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,620
It doesn't have electrons either.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
So, it will form a bond with another one like itself.

493
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,410
So it will make a banana bond.

494
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,080
What is this coordinate covenant bond?

495
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,660
That is the exception, son. I taught you that in class.

496
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,040
But, sir, the banana bond is an exception in itself.

497
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,410
Son, this is an exception to the exception.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,750
Class, what did I say was the first rule of chemistry?

499
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,500
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

500
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,500
Let's move on.

501
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,040
The eighth question. D.

502
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,540
Don't take stress. We will solve the chocolate problem.

503
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,540
Hey, bro! What's up? - Scram!

504
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,540
Scram! Scram! - Go.

505
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,540
Is he crazy?

506
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,160
Meena, get out of this illusion.

507
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,540
We are not going to get chocolate.

508
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,000
Do you understand? We won't be able to do anything.

509
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,000
We won't be able to do anything no matter how many teachers are changed.

510
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,950
I made enquiries.

511
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,160
The A6 batch students have also taken a corresponddence course of our institute.

512
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,250
The scoundrels have the solutions before the DPP is discussed.

513
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,080
They get chocolate but they don't score marks in the test.

514
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,540
That's why they are still in A6.

515
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,540
Why don't we take private classes outside the institute for inorganic.

516
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,500
Really? - Yes.

517
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,410
And what will we gain from it?

518
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,950
What will we gain from it? What will we gain?

519
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,950
They will teach us well, won't they? Even these people are teaching us well.

520
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,200
Meena, the problem is not with the teachers.

521
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,080
The problem is with this nasty subject!

522
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,330
It is an utterly boring subject!

523
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,540
There are only facts that have no logic.

524
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,000
There are more exceptions than the number of rules in the name of logic.

525
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,080
In the first octet rule they say there should be only 8 electrons..

526
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,330
..but then any number of electrons are making compounds.

527
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,450
Four. Six. Seven. Eight. Ten.

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,000
And Twelve. - Yes.

529
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,160
One atom has so many models.

530
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,950
First they teach you Dalton's model.

531
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,080
The moment you understand it they say, "Oh, this is incorrect."

532
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,450
Alright. Let's say they made a mistake once.

533
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,120
Then they teach you Thompson plum pudding model. Even that is wrong.

534
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,370
Then they teach you Rutherford model. Even that is incorrect.

535
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,200
Then why are you teaching us?

536
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,410
Make it first. Sit down and make it.

537
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,290
No, no, no. We will teach you.

538
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,950
We will teach you. Bohr's model.

539
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,000
Heisenberg model.

540
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,200
None of them are entirely correct.

541
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,910
These people are making fools of us by calling it exception.

542
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,370
This is not an exception. It is an excuse. Pure excuse.

543
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,540
They don't have a theory that gives you all the answers.

544
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,540
And how could they have a theory? Tell me. How could they have it?

545
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,540
Geniuses like Einstein and Newton gave theories.

546
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,870
They never read this moronic subject.

547
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,120
There's no logic.

548
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,040
All they have is exception, exception and exception.

549
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,120
'Inception' did not confuse me as much as exception has.

550
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,540
Every atom acts and reacts as it pleases here.

551
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,580
The oxidation state of all of them changes.

552
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,790
Plus two. Minus seven. Plus three. Minus half.

553
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,160
Even the oxidation state of oxygen is not fixed.

554
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,790
When your own elements don't give a damn..

555
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,660
..then why make a happy periodic family? Why?

556
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,790
Learn from math. Learn.

557
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,450
Zero to nine is fixed once and for all. Final.

558
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,160
But here, their elements aren't fixed till date.

559
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,700
Something new crops up every year.

560
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,120
Boom! Number 113 is the number picked in this year's lucky draw.

561
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,540
We shall call it! Nikenugium. No, no, no. Nikeniugium!

562
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,750
Damn it! It is easier to recite a Sanskrit mantra.

563
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
Newton gave us three laws. Three.

564
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,620
Half our physics is covered with it..

565
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
..but here, there is a new rule for every question.

566
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,080
Admit it. Admit that you are not logical like physics and math.

567
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,790
Okay. Eat some.. - No!

568
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,500
Tell me something. It is simple.

569
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,250
What will happen if you toss an apple in the air?

570
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,450
It will fall. - It will fall? It will fall?

571
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,790
But it will fall in physics. It won't fall in chemistry.

572
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,250
What will happen in chemistry? There will be steric hindrance.

573
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,080
If that's not enough then resonance, inductive effect.

574
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,790
Everything will happen. Anything can happen here.

575
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,200
They don't even name the colors simply.

576
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,450
It's not green. It's apple green. It's not red. It's crimson red.

577
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,910
It's not pink. It's hot pink!

578
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,750
That's why only girls are so good at chemistry.

579
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,290
They make you do nonsense.

580
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,250
Flame test. Salt analysis. Titration. Brown ring test.

581
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,450
Rotten eggs smell. Why should I smell a rotten egg?

582
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,450
Why? I am a Brahmin!

583
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,830
Atomic size trend. Ionization potential trend.

584
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,830
Electron-affinity trend. Electron -negativity trend. Horizontal trend.

585
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,830
Vertical trend.

586
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,000
You can call something a trend when you can predict something with it.

587
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,830
If anything is happening anywhere and anytime like 'Thugs of Hindustan'..

588
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,200
..then how can they call it a trend?

589
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,450
How can they call it that?

590
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,750
I am telling you, Meena.

591
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,750
Chemistry is not a subject. It is subjective.

592
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,750
I did so much for this subject.

593
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,620
Assignments, notes, flash cards. I sat in the front row.

594
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,160
Changed three teachers. Changed the studying strategy.

595
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,410
But what is the end result? Zilch!

596
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,540
He wouldn't stop, Jeetu Bhaiya.

597
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,200
That's why I brought him to you.

598
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,200
You have understood it correctly.

599
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,950
The problem is not with the teacher, it's with the subject.

600
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
There must be some reason you find physicists only in universities..

601
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,160
..while you find chemists at every corner.

602
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,830
You understand that you cannot memorize so much, right?

603
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,040
Fine. - But how does that solve the problem, Bhaiya?

604
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,290
It isn't? - No.

605
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,120
I thought it was simple.

606
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,160
Okay, let's say you have to go on a date.

607
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,250
You have a girlfriend? - No.

608
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,120
Let's assume you have a hot girl like Katrina.

609
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,040
Ma'am is punctual. She calls you at 8 o'clock sharp.

610
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,950
If you're going on a date you will take a gift for her, won't you?

611
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,910
Champagne, bouquet.. - Teddy bear. Pink.

612
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,080
Your ideas are very different.

613
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,660
Anyway, let's assume you take a teddy bear.

614
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,040
You bump into a thief on the way.

615
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,040
He snatches the teddy bear and runs.

616
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,250
What will you do? - How can he run away?

617
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,790
I will catch hold of him and punch him.

618
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,500
Of course. Ideally that's what you should do.

619
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,200
But the thief is fast.

620
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,040
And you have two gifts in your hands. Then?

621
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,040
Then we scream aloud. Someone will surely help.

622
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,250
That could be one approach.

623
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,200
Maybe it will work. What will you do?

624
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,290
I will forget about the gift..

625
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,160
..and rush with the remaining two gifts.

626
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,700
So, rush!

627
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,200
I told you it is simple. IIT is the hot gal.

628
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,750
Sure. The bouquet and champagne are math and physics..

629
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,080
..while the teddy is inorganic chemistry..

630
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,580
..which we are unable to get hold of.

631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,910
But, Bhaiya, the real life girlfriend wants the teddy.

632
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,250
I won't get admission into IIT without inorganic.

633
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,200
Who says so?

634
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,080
Who is the IITian in this room?

635
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,040
Do you think I memorized chemistry like a jackass?

636
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,290
Before you study for an exam, study the exam.

637
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,660
What do you think? How much do you need to score during those six hours to get into top five IITs?

638
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,660
90 percent for top five.. - No, no. Are you insane? 95 percent.

639
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,580
95 percent.

640
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,370
How will you face this savage world?

641
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,830
It will eat you alive! 40 percent.

642
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
Only 40 percent for top five?

643
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,910
Only 40 percent for top five IIT?

644
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,910
You are kidding, aren't you, Bhaiyar?

645
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,540
There are many things apart from memes on the internet.

646
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,660
Go and watch videos of Unacademy. Strategy for IIT JEE.

647
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,910
JEE toppers and scientists take time out to make some videos for you.

648
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,450
At least do that much. Is your Jeetu Bhaiya going to solve everything?

649
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,390
Even if omit 60 percent of the syllabus..

650
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,750
..you still stand a chance to get into IIT.

651
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
The syllabus for inorganic chemistry might be vast.

652
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,160
So, let it be.

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
How much weightage does it carry in our exam?

654
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,040
How much weightage would chemistry carry in our exam? Tell me.

655
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,290
Chemistry would be one-third. - 33 percent.

656
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,080
One third of that would be.. - 11 percent.

657
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,790
Think about it.

658
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,870
Do you want to chase 11 percent..

659
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,580
..and ruin the crease on your trousers..

660
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,700
..or focus on 89 percent?

661
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,870
Score 40 percent and then enjoy in a good IIT for four years.

662
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,830
Bhaiya, I shall burn up all the sheets of Inorganic today.

663
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,250
End of story! - That's wrong.

664
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,950
Yes. It is knowledge. It is a sin.

665
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,370
Sell it as waste paper.

666
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,950
You will get some money. Eat some snacks with it.

667
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,950
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, one can improve one's rank with inorganic, right?

668
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,480
Inorganic improves the rank of those who are actually getting a rank.

669
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,950
But in your case, it will leave you rankless.

670
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,330
So, the best way to tackle problems like these..

671
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,700
..is not to get involved. Just take the fast lane.

672
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,250
Do you understand? Come on, you guys. Leave. Leave.

673
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,290
Go.

674
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,080
Why do you look so confused, Meena?

675
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,040
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, the other day you said..

676
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,250
..if you have a problem in life you confront it.

677
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,290
Make your problem a dare. Make your dare a habit and forge ahead.

678
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,500
Today you are saying to let Inorganic go if we don't know it.

679
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,540
Son, Inorganic chemistry is an exception.

680
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,540
Come on. Leave.

681
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Thank you, Bhaiya.

682
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,160
Objective in the exams should not be to solve all the problems..

683
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,040
..but to solve the maximum number of questions.

684
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,870
If the problem is very confusing and time consuming, they you can skip it.

685
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,750
If you have any time remaining then get back to it.

686
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,620
Bear in mind, not every problem is meant to be solved.

687
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,370
Vaibhav Pandey! - Aunty?

688
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,800
I've told you so many times not to put so many clothes..

689
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,200
..in the second hand washing machine.

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
Do you think about electricity and water?

691
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,040
Aunty.

692
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,250
How are you?

693
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,480
Take this. This is your extra charge.

694
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,200
And I shall give it to you every month.

695
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
Just don't disturb me for the entire month.

696
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,200
Thank you.
