- 好了嗎? -馬上來
You done? - Yes. Almost.

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,910
快點，快點
Hurry up. Hurry up.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,330
今天我們早點到，坐前排
Today we'll reach early and take the front row.

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,330
我終於做完了DPP試卷
After so long I've completed the DPP.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,450
巴特拉先生說得對
Batla sir is right.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,620
無機物學的好，冇有問題解不了 -是的
If one knows inorganic the questions get solved instantly. - Yes.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,370
天知道他們為什麼教原子軌道
Lord knows why they teach SPDF orbital.

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,330
就應該從無機物開始
They should begin with Inorganic.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,910
這樣學生的自信心一定能夠得到提升 -是的
That ways student's confidence will get a boost. - Yes.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,250
這是我第一次在15分鍾內做完DPP
For the first time I could finish the DPP in fifteen mins.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,910
我十二分鍾就做完了
I finished in twelve.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,410
有可能冇有仔細讀題
Well, it's possible you made some mistakes in haste.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,330
- 走著瞧 - 真的嗎？
Wait for it to be discussed. - Really?

14
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,910
好吧，我們走著瞧
Well, alright. We shall see.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,910
分數低的人
The one who has more correct answers..

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,330
要請對方吃泡芙
..has to treat the other to Shreeji's onion puffs.

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,910
那就來賭一把
It's a bet. - It's a bet.

18
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,290
-你會輸的 -快走吧
You will lose. - Come. Come. Come.

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,040
你應該加快速度了，這題用了你15分鍾
You have to do something. It took you 15 minutes.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,660
花點時間冇問題，但要做得完美
One should take time but do it perfectly.

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,790
瓦伊巴夫潘迪！
Vaibhav Pandey!

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,540
是的，阿姨
Yes, aunty.

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,000
瓦伊巴夫潘迪-什麼事？
Vaibhav Pandey. - Yes, aunty.

24
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,620
你的風扇昨天冇關-不，阿姨，風扇關了
Your fan was left on yesterday. - No, aunty. The fan was off.

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,700
冇關! -也許是你冇關
It was on! - Maybe it was left on.

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,790
阿姨，風扇關了-不要說謊
Aunty, the fan was off. - Don't tell lies.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,450
我能聽到風扇的聲音
I could hear the fan on full speed all the way up.

28
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,910
阿姨，在我們的房間聽不到風扇的聲音 -嗯
Aunty, when the sound of our fan can't be heard our room. - Yes.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
在你的房間裏怎麼可能聽到聲音？
How can the sound of our fan be heard in your room?

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
別跟我說你那些物理學理論
Don't apply your physics in this matter..

31
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,500
如果你晚上再不關空調
..because if the fan is left on again..

32
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,500
我就用我的數學理論，給你下個月的房租漲200盧比
..I shall apply my math and increase 200 rupees in the rent next month.

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,200
邦蒂！
Bunty!

34
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,500
阿姨……
Aunty. List..

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,500
走，走，走
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,500
老巫婆! 她一邊刷牙還要一邊要錢
Old hag! She is demanding money whilst brushing her teeth.

37
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,250
那就把錢給她-這不是錢的問題
So give her the money. - It's not about the money.

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,700
拉裏塔 · 帕瓦爾！
Lalita Pawar!

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,790
在我爸麵前，她錶現得像妮露帕 · 羅伊
In dad's presence she was acting like Nirupa Roy.

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,160
"他就像我的兒子"
He is like my Bunty.

41
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,540
"我喜歡..." 該死！
I like.. Damn!

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,250
即使我不得不關著風扇睡覺
Even if I have to sleep with the fan off..

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,830
我也絕不會給她漲房租的借口
..I won't give her an excuse to increase the rent.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,660
好吧，先別想這個了
Okay. You can think about Tarka later.

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,660
我們去前排搶個位置，讓他們看看
Let's sit in the first bench now and show them.

46
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,620
還剩10分鍾下課
Only ten minutes left in class.

47
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,620
大家註意了
Everybody pay attention.

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,910
這是一個非常重要的例外
This is a very important exception.

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,660
這是 JEE 2005年真題
It was asked in JEE 2005.

50
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,200
碘化銀是離子化合物，但它不溶於水
Silver Iodide is an ionic compound still it's not soluble in water.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,830
為什麼? 因為這適用於法楊原則
Why? Because Fajan's rule applies here.

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
什麼是法楊原則?-冇有離子化合物是完全離子的
What was it? - No ionic compound is completely ionic..

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,750
冇有一種共價化合物是完全共價的
..and no covalent compound is completely covalent.

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,080
非常好！
Very good!

55
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,620
是的，米娜爾，你看
Right, Meenal. You see..

56
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,130
就這樣你的排名就上升了500
Just like that your rank just rose by 500

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,700
從印度理工的計算機科學轉嚮孟買冶金學
and you move from Computer Science in IIT BHU to Metallurgy IIT Bombay.

58
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,080
看到了吧，無機物可以幫你提高排名
Look, its Inorganic that improves rank.

59
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,540
你的排名是多少，先生？
What was your rank, sir?

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,950
什麼?DPP？
What? DPP.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,040
好的，那讓我們來看 DPP
Yes, yes. Let's do DPP.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,500
你們都拿出來，快點
All of you bring it out. Come on.

63
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,500
把這個修好

00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,250
有一件很重要的事情 -是的，先生
This is most important. - Yes, sir.

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
請講

66
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,250
這是教師反饋錶
These are the faculty feedback forms.

67
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,370
兩天之內填好交上來
Fill if you care to and return them in two days.

68
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,790
另外距離第三期付款隻剩下五天了
And only five days remain towards the third installment.

69
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,120

還有你，去理個發
And you. Get a haircut.

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,120
你是哪個班的？
Where are you loitering?

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,660
好了，我們看一下DPP吧 -好的，先生！
Yes. So, let's do the DPP. - Yes, sir!

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,700
很好! 我喜歡興奮狀態

76
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,080

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,950
然後把它們保存好以後複習
And keep them away for revision.

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,080
15題是怎麼回事，先生
And what about the 15th, sir.

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,700
那是額外的獎勵題
That is a chocolate problem.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
這題是給A1的學生出的，你可以不用看
I included that exclusively for the A1 batch. You skip it.

90
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,750
好的，先生 -等下，先生
Okay, sir. - Sir! Sir!

91
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,000
先生，第14個問題的答案怎麼可能是C？
Sir, how can the answer to the 14th question be C?

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,910
這不能變成化合物
Sir, this cannot become a compound.

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,450
不符合八隅體規則
The octet rule will break here.

94
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,250
是的，你完全正確
Yes. You are absolutely correct.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,120
- 所以呢?-這是個例外，孩子
So? - This is an exception, son.

96
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,830
例外？
Exception?

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,250
但是，先生，科學不能打破規則
But, sir, rules cannot break in science.

98
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,790
誰告訴你的？
Who told you that?

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,000
例外是化學的規律
Exception is the rule of chemistry.

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,330
明白了嗎？
Got it?

101
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,910
來吧，我們開始分析鹽，坐下吧
Come on. Let's start salt analysis. Sit down. Sit down.

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,660
坐下

103
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,790
好了，註意了，大家都聽著

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,790
這很重要
It's very important.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,330
你笑什麼? 你隻答對了三道題
Why are you laughing? You got three answers correct.

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,000
你才對兩個，請客吧
You got two. Puffs.

107
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,370
我們都答的很認真
We took this very lightly, bro.

108
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,700
我還以為這是小菜一碟，但其實不是 -是的，兄弟，這當然不是小菜一碟
Thought it's a piece of cake . It isn't. - Yes, bro. It's certainly not a piece of cake.

109
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,950
今天特別辣

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,870
拿著這個
Hold this.

115
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,450
放鬆放鬆
Easy. Easy.

116
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,870
好嗎？
Okay?

117
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,750
可以都給我嗎?-可以
May I have it all? - You may.

118
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,370
把包裝紙給我就好 -謝謝
Just give me the wrapper. - Thank you.

119
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,620
包裝紙？
Wrapper?

120
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,950
他一定是個環保主義者
He must be eco-friendly.

121
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,500
非常有前途
Very promising.

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,750
不，不，這不是普通的包裝紙，是我的獎杯
No, no. These are not wrappers. They are my trophies.

123
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,620
我解決的第四個獎勵題
My fourth chocolate problem.

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,950
你能解決獎勵題嗎？
You can solve the chocolate problem?

125
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,000
你在 A6，是嗎?-那又怎樣？
You are in A6, aren't you? - So?

126
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,830
不僅僅是我，還有其他五個同學也做到了
Not just me. Five others have also done it.

127
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,870
你說什麼? -冇錯，跳過這題，這是給A1學生出的
What are you saying? - Exactly, don't do it. It is only for the A1 batch.

128
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,200
把包裝紙給我
Give me the wrapper.

129
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,500
兄弟
Bro.

130
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,950
你多少……我不是很在意的哈
So, how much.. Not that it matters to me.

131
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,450
你在無機DPP考試中得了多少分？
How much do you score in Inorganic DPP?

132
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,200
無機物？
In inorganic?

133
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,700
12、13分吧
About 12 or 13.

134
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,870
你呢？

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,660
13、14分那樣子

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,040
是的，13、14分
Yes. 13 or 14.

137
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,040
非常有前途! 非常有前途！
Very promising! Very promising!

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450
他們可以解決獎勵題
These people can solve the chocolate problem.

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,790
A6和我們A5有什麼不同？
What is different in their A6 from our A5?

140
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,950
牆壁的顔色，長凳的寬度
The color of the walls. The width of the benches.

141
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,870
粉絲的數量
The number of fans.

142
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,790
還有教職員工
Also, the faculty.

143
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,620
怎麼了？
Why?

144
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,370
來吧，我知道了
Come. I'll tell you.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,540
來來來
Come. Come. Come.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,910
你在幹什麼? 你瘋了嗎？
What are you doing? Are you insane?

147
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,580
給他零分，零分
Give him zero. Zero.

148
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,870
如果巴特拉的教學不合格
If Batla's teaching isn't up to the mark..

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
我們會給他什麼樣的反饋？
..what will we give him in the feedback form?

150
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,790
給他零分，對吧？
We will give him a zero, won't we?

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,250
判低分和羞辱學生是老師的事情，而不是學生
Awarding bad marks and humiliating thereafter suits teachers, not students.

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,410
這也是來自A5的
That too from A5.

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,200
你這個笨蛋! 如果我們不給出糟糕的反饋
You dork! If we don't give bad feedback..

154
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,580
他隻會繼續教下去
..he only will continue to teach.

155
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,040
那你怎麼學無機物呢？
Then how will you learn inorganic?

156
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,040
老師和家長是平等的
Teachers are equal to parents.

157
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,790
那麼你也應該給他們反饋
Then you should give them feedback too.

158
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,040
爸爸，你不是一個稱職的父親
Dad, you are not up to the mark as a father.

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,410
以後隔壁王叔叔睡在你的臥室裏
Hereafter uncle will sleep in your bedroom.

160
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,040
冇道理的，冷靜點
That doesn't make sense. Cool down.

161
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,080
去把風扇打開
Go and switch on the fan.

162
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,250
風扇今天不開了
The fan won't be switched on today.

163
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,000
但是我覺得有點熱
But I am feeling a little hot.

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,160
先填反饋錶，然後打開風扇
Fill the form first. Then the fan will be switched on.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,330
我要去喝水
I am going to drink water.

166
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,120
米納！
Meena!

167
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
這是一個領先的時代
There was this 'Dwapar' era..

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,370
像德羅納查裏亞這樣的大師在過去備受尊敬
..when Gurus like Dronacharya used to be respected.

169
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,120
這就是這個時代……-嘿! 就連阿俊都和德羅納查裏亞打過仗
And here is this era.. - Hey! Even Arjun fought Dronacharya.

170
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,120
你連《羅摩衍那》都冇學好
Even your Ramayana is weak..

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,410
德羅納查裏亞先生是有史以來最好的老師
..where as Dronacharya sir was like the best teacher ever.

172
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,830
史上最好的老師！
Bestest teacher ever!

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,830
但他還是和他打了起來，為什麼？
And yet he fought with him. Why?

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,540
逮捕陰謀
For seizure of a plot.

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,120
而你甚至不能在反饋錶上給巴特拉老師打低分
And you, Meena, can't even fill a single feedback form against Batla for JEE.

176
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,120
如果是我，我會從這裏跳下去
If it were me, I'd have leapt from here.

177
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,080
你自己給他低分吧，我不幹
Go ahead. Give him bad marks. I won't do it.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,410
好吧
Okay.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,750
好吧，好吧
Okay. Fine. Fine.

180
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,330
你也會像巴特拉一樣，爛在一些私立工程學院裏
You'll also rot in some private engineering college like that Batla of yours.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,540
考不上印度理工的渣渣
Bloody non-IITians.

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,790
嘿！
Hey!

183
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,580
怎麼了?-冇什麼，阿姨
What's going on? - Nothing, aunty.

184
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,950
水灑出來了
I felt a spray of water.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
你們用飲用水過潑水節呢？
You are playing holi with drinking water?

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,830
是的，姨媽 -不，阿姨我們隻是……
You are right, aunt. - No, aunty. We were simply.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,830
罰款300
300 rupees will be increased.

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,830
阿姨，阿姨-邦蒂！
Aunty. Aunty. - Bunty!

189
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,950
阿姨你聽我說，阿姨！
Aunty, listen to me. Aunty!

190
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,120
我就像你兒子邦迪……
I am just like your Bunty.

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,080
媽！
Mummy!

192
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
我以後去旁邊的研究所取水
I will fill water from the neighboring institute.

193
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,870
我才不會付錢給這個老巫婆! 該死的
But will not pay this witch! Bloody grouch.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,040
拿著，我已經簽了名
Take this. I've signed it.

195
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,160
你想怎麼寫就怎麼寫吧，混蛋！
Fill what you want in it. Son of a witch!

196
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,410
對不起 -冇關係，兄弟
Sorry, pal. - It's okay, bro.

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,870
“隻有雲才能理解大地的渴望”
'Only a cloud understands the thirst of the Earth.'

198
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,410
嘿，庫馬爾維什瓦斯! 來-去哪裏？
Hey, Kumar Vishwas! Come. - Where?

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,000
來吧
Come along.

200
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,410
我們已經給了零分
We have given it..

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,370
但是隻有當每個人都他打零分時，巴特拉才會被解職
..but Batla will only be removed when everyone gives bad feedback.

202
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,250
“冇有朋友的生活有什麼意義? ”
"What good is a life with no friends?"

203
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,500
拿著，兄弟，我填好了
Take this, bro. I filled the form.

204
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
趕走那個惡棍肖漢！
Remove that scoundrel Chauhan!

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,580
教員的名字是巴特拉
The faculty's name is Batla.

206
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,580
肖漢先生是A2的老師，不是 A5
Chauhan sir teaches in A2, not in A5.

207
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,950
哦，糟糕! 我掉到 A5了？
Oh crap! I've fallen till A5?

208
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,290
“不是根據地圖，不是根據宗教或需求”
"Not by maps, not by religion or by need."

209
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,450
“我的世界是由朋友組成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

210
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,910
“由你的愛，你的聲音和你的崇拜組成”
"Made up of your love, your sound and your worship."

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,870
“我的世界是由朋友組成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

212
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,000
等一下
Just a minute.

213
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,040
不，我不會給出負麵的反饋，也不會讓你給出負麵的反饋
No. Neither will I give a negative feedback and nor will let you give it.

214
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,870
為什麼? 他是你叔叔嗎?-是的！
Why? Is he your uncle? - Yes!

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,540
他是你叔叔?-是的
He is your uncle? - Yes.

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,250
家人?-是的，家人
Family? - Yes. Family.

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,540
兄弟，教學風格……巴特拉? -零分
Look, bro. Teaching style.. Batla? - Zero.

218
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,000
兩分吧，給這個可憐的家夥打個兩分
Two. Two. Let's give the poor chap two.

219
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
解答能力 -零！
Doubt solving. - Zero!

220
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
一分，一分
One. One. One.

221
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,870
個性 -零！
Personality. - Zero!

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
零，零，零
Zero. Zero. Zero.

223
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,500
還有守時-零
And punctuality. - Nil.

224
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,000
對不起，我每天午飯前和晚飯後都要背誦一次元素周期錶
Sorry. I revise my periodic table once daily before lunch and after dinner.

225
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,330
很好
That's nice.

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,830
非常好！
Very nice!

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,410
錶格?-哦，反饋錶格！
The form? - Oh, feedback form!

228
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,850
我在無機化學課上學得很好，所以不需要填錶了
I am doing well in Inorganic so, no need for me to fill it up.

229
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,830
再見，我還要複習所有的原子半徑
Well, bye. I have to revise all the atomic radii too.

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,750
我們走，瓦巴夫，來吧
Let's go, Vaibhav. Come.

231
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,750
我們在 A5，但我們不是命中註定
We are in A5 but we are not destined..

232
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,580
能像 A6的學生一樣解決獎勵題
..to be able to solve the chocolate problem like the A6 students.

233
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,000
你說什麼？
What did you say?

234
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,250
非常好的主動性！
Very nice initiative!

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,290
巴特拉應該換了
Batla should be changed.

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,330
事實上，這個培訓班的每一位老師都應該換掉
In fact, every teacher in this coaching class should be changed.

237
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,950
不，不，這個行業應該改變
No, no. This coaching industry should change.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,330
考試模式、教學大綱、課程設置
Exam pattern, syllabus, curriculum. Pedagogy should change.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,330
理工學院應該改，整個教育體係都應該改
IIT should change. This whole educational system should change.

240
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
為此……
And for that..

241
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,330
應該改變父權製
..patriarchy should change.

242
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,160
你覺得怎麼樣，施萬吉？
What do you think, Shivangi?

243
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,160
我認為你應該先上課
I think you should attend class first.

244
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,370
A1，A2，A3，A4，A5.
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. Inorganic.

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,290
無機物下的 AWS 是什麼？
What is AWS under inorganic?

246
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,160
阿瓦斯，以後他教我們嗎?-什麼? 巴特拉走了？
Awasthi. Will he teach us now? - What? Batla is gone?

247
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
他走得很體麵
He acted very respectable.

248
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,700
他不是離開的，而是被離開的
He isn't gone. He has been removed.

249
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,620
叔叔
Uncle.

250
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,790
巴特拉先生-你好
Mr. Batla. - Hi.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,540
你好 -好，坐，坐，坐
How are you? - Yes. Sit. Sit. Sit.

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,000
什麼風把你吹來了？
So, tell me. What brings you here?

253
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,500
我隻是想和你談談，先生
I just wanted to talk to you, sir.

254
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,790
嗯，你說吧-先生，我不能繼續在A5授課了
Yes, yes. Tell me. - Sir, I've lost A5.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,500
是的-如果您能讓我上額外的課來解決疑問的話……
Yes. - If you could let me give extra classes to resolve doubts..

256
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,910
對無機化學課程也有疑問嗎? 誰會來上課，先生？
Doubt classes that too of Inorganic? Who will attend, sir?

257
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,750
隻要不降低我的工資，我什麼都願意做
Just don't decrease my salary. I will do anything.

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,540
給我一個低年級的班
Give me a junior class if you wish.

259
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,500
我還可以教八年級的物理
I can even teach 8th grade physics.

260
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,700
你怎麼能這麼說? 我們都很尊敬你
How can you say that, sir? You are respectable to us, sir.

261
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,580
不是這樣的，先生，當無機化學需要刻苦學習時
Not true, sir. The other subjects are respected..

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,580
其他學科才會收到尊重-是的
..when inorganic demands the most hard work. - Yes.

263
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,450
每天早上都要複習
One has to revise every morning.

264
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,660
然而其他人的工資更高
Yet the others have better salaries.

265
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,370
聽著，先生，數學和物理老師都是理工學院畢業的
Look, sir. Math and Physics are taught by IITians.

266
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,000
如果給他們錢少了一定會跳槽的
Pay less to them and other institutes poach them.

267
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,750
這就是姐夫付給他們高薪的原因
That's why brother-in-law pays them so much.

268
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,250
我又能怎麼樣呢，先生？
What can I do in this matter, sir?

269
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,250
我隻能給你侄子提供獎學金，對不對？
I could only offer your nephew a scholarship. Did I or didn't I?

270
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,040
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
事實上，他並冇有得獎學金的資格
When in fact, he didn't deserve it.

272
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,040
但就算是要換掉我，饒先生也是個不錯的替代者
But, sir, even if I was to be removed Mr. Rao. would've been a respectable replacement.

273
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,830
或者是 A6的老師帕敏德
Or maybe that teacher of A6. Parminder.

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,120
即使是他也會是一個更好的選擇
Even he would have been a better option.

275
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,120
但是，你卻用我的下屬代替了我
But sir, you replaced me with my junior.

276
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,830
他就是個神經病
You know what, sir? He is a psycho.

277
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,830
他什麼都不懂，還經常來聽我的課
He doesn't know anything. He used to attend my lectures.

278
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,620
那樣的話，你自己也有問題，不是嗎？
In that case, sir, even you made a mistake, didn't you?

279
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,500
初級和高級在無機化學裏無關緊要
Junior and senior don't matter in inorganic, sir.

280
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,540
總得有人留下，所以我們就留下了他
Someone had to be retained. So, we did.

281
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,620
那個可憐的家夥肯定是個神經病
And that poor chap will be a psycho.

282
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,370
在過去的四個月裏，他也一直在家裏無所事事
He too has been idling at home for the past 4 months.

283
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,370
他還能再空閒四個月，他有兩家旅館
He can idle another four months. He owns two hostels.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,790
告訴我，先生，如果他是一個真正的老師
Tell me something, sir. If he was a true teacher..

285
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,910
他現在不是應該加入什麼教師學院了嗎？
..wouldn't he join some coaching institute by now?

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
你為什麼要取笑這個可憐的家夥，先生？
Why are you making fun of the poor chap, sir?

287
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,950
就連你都知道，冇有一所學院會挖角化學老師
Even you are aware no institute poaches Inorganic faculty.

288
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,500
站起來! 快點站起來！
Up! Stand up quickly!

289
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,500
如果你不知道這個例外情況，那麼到今天為止你都學了什麼？
What have you studied till date if you don't know this exception?

290
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,000
今天打電話給你的父母，告訴他們你考不上印度理工
Call your family today and tell them you won't be able to crack IIT.

291
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,800
如果你冇有勇氣告訴他們，那就下載個抖音
And if you don't have the courage to tell them, then download 'tic tok'.

292
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,500
許多像你這樣的混蛋在那裏麵跳舞，甚至賺得還不少
Many jerks like you dance there and even earn more than they deserve.

293
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,910
我第一個給你點贊
I'll be your first customer. Take this!

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,410
15道題才得4分
You scored four out of fifteen.

295
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,790
先生，你們講解過後麵的超綱題嗎?-是的
Sir, do you discuss the chocolate problems? - Yes, yes.

296
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,040
我當然知道-那麼這個題例外的原因是什麼
Of course I do. - So what is the reason for this exception...

297
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,030
但我隻和A1的學生討論
But only with A1 batch students.

298
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,830
因為他們不會像A5學生那樣問愚蠢的問題
..because they don't ask stupid questions like A5 students.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,830
"這些都是事實，但是不行"
These are facts, information. But no!

300
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,700
“我們需要邏輯”
"We want logic."

301
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,290
"先生，為什麼紙幣隻有100和50盧比的麵額？"
Sir, why do notes only come in 100 and 50 rupee denominations?

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,660
"為什麼冇有75？"
Why not 75?

303
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,870
"為什麼蘭比爾選擇了阿莉亞? 為什麼不是迪皮卡？"
Why did Ranbir choose Alia? Why not Deepika?

304
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,250
你隻要記住就可以了
Simply memorize what's written and be done with it.

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,830
但是不行! “我們要邏輯，我們要成為頂級人物”
But no! "We want logic. We want to be toppers."

306
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,330
“先生，你知道為什麼我是 A5而不是 A1的嗎？
"Sir, do you know why I am a topper from A5 and not from A1?

307
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,450
因為我是蠢驢”
Because I am an ass."

308
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,560
咿哈! 咿哈! 咿哈！
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,830
如果你想學好無機化學，那就照我說的做
If you want to learn inorganic then you do as I tell you.

310
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,830
繼續背，就這樣！
Keep memorizing it. That's that!

311
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,830
毫無疑問
No questions asked.

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
大家都明白了嗎?-是的，長官！
Everyone got it!? - Yes, sir!

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,160
大聲說出來-是，長官！
Say it aloud. - Yes, sir!

314
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,330
我聽不見-是，長官！
I can't hear you. - Yes, sir!

315
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,790
很好！
Good!

316
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,500
現在我們來看一些97年的真題
Now some questions from JEE '97.

317
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,700
我們可以解出來的
We shall solve them.

318
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,200
這題對你們來說真的很重要
They're really important for you guys.

319
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,200
打開你的筆記本
Remove your note books.

320
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,000
先生，我們有個請求
Sir, we have a request.

321
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,000
你付分期付款了嗎?-我們付了，先生！
Have you paid the installment? - We paid it, sir!

322
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,830
我們很久以前就付清了
We paid it long ago.

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,330
好吧說吧
Okay, talk.

324
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,580
先生，你..
Sir, you..

325
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,500
先生，化學老師還能換人嗎？
Sir, can the Inorganic faculty be changed once again?

326
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,500
可以
Yes.

327
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,910
為什麼不呢？
Why not?

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
明年填寫反饋錶
Fill the feedback form next year.

329
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,500
就可以換了
It'll be changed.

330
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,790
先生，明年就太晚了，先生
Sir. Next year will be too late, sir.

331
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,950
你為什麼不讓巴特拉複職呢，先生？
Why don't you reinstate Batla sir?

332
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,620
你們這些冇用的家夥就不配填反饋錶
You worthless chaps should never be given the feedback forms.

333
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,620
頂尖的學生都冇大驚小怪
The toppers never make any fuss.

334
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,950
出去！
Get out!

335
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,250
就這還想考印度理工
They want to be IITians.

336
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
米納爾也很沮喪，先生
Meenal is also frustrated, sir.

337
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,290
她怎麼了
What happened to her? - Hee-haw. Hee-haw.

338
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,040
給她打電話
Call Meenal.

339
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,790
你這個白癡! 給我！
You idiot! Give it to me!

340
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,420
我告訴過你很多次了，你要把這個號碼牢記在心
I've told you so many times you should know topper's phone numbers by heart.

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,450
你好哦，可愛的孩子米納爾
Hello. Oh sweet child Meenal.

342
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,850
(哭泣)
(sobs)

343
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,700
新來的化學老師有什麼問題嗎？
Is there any... problem with the new sir?

344
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,370
(哭泣)
(sobs)

345
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,830
告訴我，孩子
Tell me, child.

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,660
是的，先生，有一點
Yes, sir. A little bit.

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,660
那你還等什麼? 你是今年的頭牌
Then why did you wait? You are this year's topper.

348
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,230
頭牌？
Topper?

349
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,140
- 女生頭牌
- Girls topper.

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,250
如果有什麼事，你應該立即給我發信息
If anything happens, you should message me immediately.

351
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,410
所以你才有我的私人電話
That's why you have my personal number.

352
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,200
是的，先生我換了手機，所以你的號碼弄丟了
Yes, sir. I changed my phone so, your number got misplaced.

353
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,200
來，記好
Take it down.

354
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,000
9862...
9-8-6-2...

355
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,190
我一會兒給你
I'll give it to you later.

356
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,910
好吧
Okay.

357
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,290
把阿瓦斯換到基礎班
Put Awasthi in the foundation course.

358
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,250
告訴我，你想要哪個先生？
Tell me. Which sir would you like?

359
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,120
來自 A6的老師
The teacher from A6.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,330
是的，A6的老師
Yes. The teacher from A6.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,790
來自 A6的老師
The teacher from A6.

362
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,040
帕... 米... 德
Par...min...der.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
好的-好的
Okay - Yes.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
好吧
Okay.

365
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
聽著，她是這家夥的女朋友
Look. She is this dude's girlfriend..

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,540
但是誰在追她? 所有科塔的男孩？
..but who all are chasing her? All the boys in Kota?

367
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,410
哪裏來的男孩?-科塔的男孩！
The boys from where? - Boys in Kota!

368
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,830
但是這家夥的女朋友拒絕了所有人，除了“這家夥”
But dude's girlfriend refuses everyone except 'the dude'.

369
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,120
那這家夥算什麼?-例外
So what does that make the dude? - Exception.

370
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,000
那他的女朋友是什麼？
And what does that make the girlfriend?

371
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,830
無辜的，她愛上那個混蛋了！
Innocent. She fell for that jerk!

372
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,410
我們必須了解這件事的要點
We must understand the gist of the matter.

373
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,540
任何有化學反應的地方都有什麼?-例外！
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

374
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,080
非常好! 這很有趣
Very good! This is fun.

375
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,000
所以那家夥在課堂外看到我，說無機化學是危險的
So the dude sees me outside the class and says Inorganic chemistry is dangerous.

376
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,450
這非常複雜
It is very complicated.

377
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,830
我不幹了
I will quit.

378
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,620
我說，兄弟，你的女朋友也很複雜
I said, brother, your girlfriend is also complicated.

379
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,140
你會離開她嗎？
Do you leave her?

380
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,710
- 不會，你要怎麼做?-你會時刻關註她
No. What do you do with her? You pay her attention.

381
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,910
你把註意力集中在她身上，好好跟她說話
You focus on her. You talk to her nicely.

382
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,370
肖納，莫娜，巴佈，傑杜，托納
Shona. Mona. Babu. Jadu. Tona.

383
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,120
還會叫什麼？
What else do you call?

384
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,250
看看，這個聽到這個，連坐在後排聽課的教師都很專註
Look at that. On hearing it even the Bajrang dal at the back is attentive.

385
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,830
你好，坐直了
Hello. Sit straight.

386
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,160
是的
Yes.

387
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,370
你覺得這很有趣，兄弟
You find it very amusing, bro.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,700
站起來
Stand up.

389
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,620
你有女朋友嗎？
You have a girlfriend?

390
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,580
你冇有，情理之中
You don't. That's not surprising.

391
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,750
坐下
Sit down.

392
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,040
正如這位小老弟是孤獨的，同樣，硼也是孤獨的
Just as our brother here is alone, similarly boron is alone.

393
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,870
硼缺少電子，但是冇有人給它
Boron is short of electrons but nobody is giving it.

394
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,910
那麼，我們該怎麼辦？
So, what will we do?

395
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,540
它會繼續獨自存在嗎？
Will it remain alone?

396
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,870
- 我們的兄弟一個人坐著嗎?-不
Is our brother sitting alone? No.

397
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,290
哥哥發現一隻和他一模一樣的猴子
Brother found a monkey just like him.

398
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,790
他發現了什麼?-猴子！
What did he find? - Monkey!

399
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,160
朋友，隻有我會說猴子
Friend. Only I will say monkey.

400
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,040
所以硼和自己是一樣的
So the boron finds boron like itself..

401
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,450
並與之形成一種聯係
..and forms a bond with it.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,200
不是詹姆斯 · 邦德，是連接
Not James Bond. Bond.

403
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,040
當兩個朋友結合在一起，這叫什麼？
When two friends make a bond what is it called?

404
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,500
它會變成一根香蕉，先生
It will become a banana, sir.

405
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,830
非常好的回答！
Very good answer!

406
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,080
它會形成一個香蕉鍵
It will form a banana bond.

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,910
學者們稱之為三中心到兩個電子鍵
The educated people call it three-center to two electron bond.

408
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,080
它叫什麼?-三個中心對兩個電子鍵！
What is it called? - Three-center to two electron bond!

409
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,910
不需要記住這個，它不會幫助走進印度理工
No need to remember that. It will not help you clear IIT.

410
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,660
我們的目標是什麼?-印度理工
What do we want to clear? - IIT!

411
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,040
非常好！
Very good!

412
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,540
那麼你們兩個，你們有聯係嗎？
So you two. Have you formed a bond?

413
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,160
你們之間有聯係嗎？
Have you formed a bond?

414
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,000
來吧，寫在你的書上
Come on. Write in your book.

415
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,870
當兩個原子結合形成類似的鍵時
When two atoms combine to form a bond of similar type..

416
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
由於缺乏電子，這種鍵被稱為香蕉鍵
..due to lack of electrons, the bond is known as banana bond.

417
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,660
孩子們，如果有任何關於香蕉鍵的問題，我們會做嗎？
Children, if there is any question on banana bond, we will do it?

418
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,410
會！
Yes, sir!

419
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,790
也就是說香蕉鍵?-冇問題
That means banana bond? - Is not a problem.

420
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,660
鈴聲已經響了
The bell has rung.

421
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,660
回去記得做作業，明天再交上來
Everyone will complete their sheets and bring them in tomorrow.

422
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,080
那些冇有完成的人會挨我一拳，好嗎？
Those who don't complete it will get a punch from me. Okay?

423
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,950
- 再見-先生! 先生! 先生! 我們來唱首歌吧
Bye. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Let's have a song.

424
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,950
一首歌，先生
A song, sir.

425
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,950
是的，先生，一首歌，先生
Yes, sir. A song, sir.

426
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,660
求你了，先生求你了……
Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.

427
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,950
安靜！
Silence!

428
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,750
你是來聽歌的嗎? 讓我唱歌？
Are you here to listen to songs? I sing songs?

429
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
這是《印度偶像》嗎？
Is this 'Indian Idol'?

430
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,000
你們父母花錢送你來是聽歌的嗎？
Is this why your parents pay your fees?

431
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,830
還讓我唱首歌……
Sing a song, sir. Sing a song.

432
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,080
他解釋得很清楚，很簡單
He explains so well. He made it so easy.

433
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,700
不僅是個好老師，也是個不錯的歌手
Apart from being the best teacher he is the best singer also.

434
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,370
A6的同學都是這麼說的
The boys from A6 said so.

435
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,370
但是他們從來冇有說過他還很幽默-冇錯
But they never said he makes you laugh so much too. - That's right.

436
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,250
我發誓，如果他不是老師，一定能上脫口秀大會
I swear if he wasn't a teacher he would surely do stand up comedy.

437
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,370
太好了，我們得到了無機化學的傑圖·拜亞-是的
Praise the lord. Its like we got the 'Jeetu Bhaiya' of Inorganic chemistry. - Yes.

438
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,950
我清楚地記得整堂課
I remember the whole lecture vividly.

439
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,200
我不需要參考我的筆記就能完成DPP
I won't have to refer to my notes to do the DPP.

440
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,330
真不錯，他一邊教我們唱歌，這才是課堂應該有的樣子
It's nice. He teaches us while singing. That's how the class should be.

441
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,120
今天，我的大腦開始産生化學反應
Today my brain has opened to chemistry.

442
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,120
門已經開了 -我今天開悟了
It's already open. - It has opened today.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,870
我說門已經開了
The door is already open.

444
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,120
把這裏的蜘蛛網清理幹淨
Clean all the cobwebs from here.

445
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,040
把箱子挪開，把所有的垃圾都扔掉
Move the suitcases and throw away all the garbage.

446
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,660
少爺回來了
Welcome, prince.

447
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
在我看來，我要從你的押金裏麵扣除一些衛生費了
It seems to me I'll have to cut money from your security now.

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
這又是怎麼了，阿姨?-這是什麼？
What happened now, aunty? - What is this?

449
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,750
地闆
The floor.

450
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,700
地闆上是什麼?-你
What is on the floor? - You.

451
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
別跟我耍小聰明
You are being a wise ass.

452
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,450
- 這是什麼汙漬? -脆皮
What kind of stains are those? Crispy. Crispy.

453
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,450
即使是蜥蜴也不能去除這些汙漬
Even lizol can't remove these.

454
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,790
我警告過你，我不想在我的科塔大理石上留下任何痕跡
I am warning you. I am warning you I don't want even a scratch on my Kota marble.

455
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,160
這不是科塔的大理石，這是科塔的石頭
This is not Kota marble. It is Kota stone.

456
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,250
你再說一遍？
What did you say to my face?

457
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,370
阿姨，以後我們對你的大理石要比對我們的書更加小心
Aunty, hereafter we shall take more care of your marble than our books.

458
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,370
哦，不
Oh, no.

459
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,370
以後我們每天都要打掃這裏
Hereafter we will have daily cleaning here..

460
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,370
你每個月要付500盧比
..and you will have to pay 500 rupees per month for it.

461
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,080
我們走
Let's go.

462
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,370
嘿!-讓開，你甚至都冇洗澡
Hey! - Get out of my way. You don't even shower.

463
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,030
阿姨，您這也冇熱水啊
'Aunty, give me hot water.'

464
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,940
骯髒的流氓
Filthy rascals.

465
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,000
我希望我能有這個阿姨的反饋錶
I wish I had a feedback form for this Tarka as well.

466
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,120
別管這個了，你現在是個英雄
Never mind Supankha. You are a hero.

467
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,290
如果不是因為你，化學老師也不能換
If it hadn't been for you neither would the inorganic teacher change..

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,910
我的運氣也不會
..nor would my luck.

469
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
兄弟，我會把我的前兩個超綱起獎勵作為供品給你
Brother, I will give you my first two chocolates as offerings.

470
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,040
別客氣，老弟
Its alright, junior.

471
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,160
來吧，孩子們，把你們的試卷打開，我們現在開始
Come on, children. Remove your sheets. We shall begin now.

472
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,200
對答案
I will tell you the answers. Check your answers.

473
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,000
第一題，非常簡單的問題，說都不想說了
The first. Very easy question. It's a shame to even discuss it.

474
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,000
答案是A，記好了，然後繼續下一題
The answer is A. Mark it and move on. Tally it.

475
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,700
第二題選B
Tell me the second. B. ZnS.

476
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,200
你們誰做過第三題？ 這是一個非常簡單的問題
Which of you have done the third? It is a very easy question.

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,040
這題口算就能解決，你要是用筆算那就太不應該了
We shall solve it orally. Its a shame if you use your pens.

478
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,200
答案是B
The answer is B.

479
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,250
這是什麼? 這麼簡單的問題簡直浪費時間
What is this? Such easy questions. Time waste.

480
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
非常基礎的問題，答案是C
Even more basic question. C is the answer.

481
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,470
如果你做錯了，好好檢查一下自己吧
If you got this wrong, get yourself checked.

482
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,090
第四題
Question number 4.

483
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,690
答案是B，非常基礎
The answer is B. Very basic.

484
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,750
答案是C 我上節課講過
The answer is C. I did it in the last class.

485
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,660
你們應該冇問題
You should have no problem.

486
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,620
第六個問題，讓我們回到第八個問題-先生！
Sixth question. Let's go to the eighth question. - Sir!

487
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,200
先生，第七題的答案怎麼可能是A?-孩子，那個……
Sir. How can the answer to question 7 be A? - Son, that..

488
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,750
它應該是C，不是嗎? -我們先對答案，等下我再講解
It should be C, shouldn't it? - Let's complete this and then I will..

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,410
不，不，先生，先告訴我
No, no, sir. Tell me this first.

490
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,250
先生，鋁是硼家族的
Sir, aluminum is from the boron family.

491
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,620
它也冇有電子
It doesn't have electrons either.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
因此，它會和另一個類似它自己的物質形成一種聯係
So, it will form a bond with another one like itself.

493
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,410
所以它會形成一個香蕉鍵
So it will make a banana bond.

494
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,080
這個並列的契約是什麼？
What is this coordinate covenant bond?

495
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,660
這是個例外，孩子，我在課堂上教過你
That is the exception, son. I taught you that in class.

496
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,040
但是，先生，香蕉鍵本身就是一個例外
But, sir, the banana bond is an exception in itself.

497
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,410
孩子，這是個例外
Son, this is an exception to the exception.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,750
同學們，我說過化學的第一法則是什麼？
Class, what did I say was the first rule of chemistry?

499
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,500
任何有化學反應的地方都有什麼?-例外！
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

500
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,500
我們繼續
Let's move on.

501
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,040
第八題
The eighth question. D.

502
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,540
別緊張，我們會解決超綱題的
Don't take stress. We will solve the chocolate problem.

503
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,540
嘿，兄弟! 怎麼了?-滾開！
Hey, bro! What's up? - Scram!

504
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,540
滾！ 滾！-快走
Scram! Scram! - Go.

505
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,540
他瘋了嗎？
Is he crazy?

506
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,160
米納，別再幻想了
Meena, get out of this illusion.

507
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,540
我們不會解開獎勵題的
We are not going to get chocolate.

508
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,000
你明白嗎? 我們什麼也做不了
Do you understand? We won't be able to do anything.

509
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,000
不管換多少老師，我們也做不了什麼
We won't be able to do anything no matter how many teachers are changed.

510
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,950
我打聽了一下
I made enquiries.

511
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,160
這批 A6級的學生也參加了我們學院的相關課程
The A6 batch students have also taken a corresponddence course of our institute.

512
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,250
在做dpp之前，他們就已經學過了
The scoundrels have the solutions before the DPP is discussed.

513
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,080
他們有巧克力，但是他們在考試中冇有得分
They get chocolate but they don't score marks in the test.

514
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,540
這就是他們仍然在A6的原因
That's why they are still in A6.

515
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,540
我們為什麼不去找個化學私教呢
Why don't we take private classes outside the institute for inorganic.

516
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,500
- 真的?-是的
Really? - Yes.

517
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,410
那又能怎樣呢？
And what will we gain from it?

518
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,950
找私教又能怎樣？
What will we gain from it? What will we gain?

519
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,950
能幫我們提高成績，不是嗎?
They will teach us well, won't they? Even these people are teaching us well.

520
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,200
米納，問題不在於老師
Meena, the problem is not with the teachers.

521
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,080
問題在於這個討厭的學科！
The problem is with this nasty subject!

522
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,330
這是一個無聊透頂的學科！
It is an utterly boring subject!

523
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,540
冇有任何邏輯可言
There are only facts that have no logic.

524
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,000
在邏輯的名義下，例外比規則多得多
There are more exceptions than the number of rules in the name of logic.

525
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,080
在第一個八隅律中，他們說應該隻有8個電子
In the first octet rule they say there should be only 8 electrons..

526
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,330
但是任何數量的電子都會産生化合物
..but then any number of electrons are making compounds.

527
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,450
四，六，七，八，十
Four. Six. Seven. Eight. Ten.

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,000
- 十二個-是的
And Twelve. - Yes.

529
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,160
一個原子有這麼多模型
One atom has so many models.

530
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,950
首先他們教你道爾頓的模型
First they teach you Dalton's model.

531
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,080
當你明白的時候，他們會說，“哦，這是不正確的”
The moment you understand it they say, "Oh, this is incorrect."

532
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,450
好吧，假設他們犯了一次錯誤
Alright. Let's say they made a mistake once.

533
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,120
然後他們教你湯普森梅子佈丁模型，即使這是錯誤的
Then they teach you Thompson plum pudding model. Even that is wrong.

534
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,370
然後他們教你盧瑟福模型，然而這也是不正確的
Then they teach you Rutherford model. Even that is incorrect.

535
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,200
那你為什麼要教我們？
Then why are you teaching us?

536
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,410
坐下來，別急
Make it first. Sit down and make it.

537
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,290
我們會教你的
No, no, no. We will teach you.

538
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,950
我們會教你波爾的模型
We will teach you. Bohr's model.

539
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,000
海森堡模型
Heisenberg model.

540
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,200
冇有一個是完全正確的
None of them are entirely correct.

541
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,910
他們說這是例外，完全是在愚弄我們
These people are making fools of us by calling it exception.

542
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,370
這不是例外，而是借口，純粹的借口
This is not an exception. It is an excuse. Pure excuse.

543
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,540
他們並冇有給出解題的理論依據
They don't have a theory that gives you all the answers.

544
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,540
他們怎麼會有理論? 告訴我，他們怎麼會有理論？
And how could they have a theory? Tell me. How could they have it?

545
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,540
像愛因斯坦和牛頓這樣的天才提出了理論
Geniuses like Einstein and Newton gave theories.

546
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,870
他們從不學這種低能的學科
They never read this moronic subject.

547
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,120
這冇有邏輯
There's no logic.

548
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,040
他們隻有例外，和更多的例外
All they have is exception, exception and exception.

549
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,120
《盜夢空間》並冇有像這些意外那樣讓我感到睏惑
'Inception' did not confuse me as much as exception has.

550
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,540
在這裏，每個原子都可以隨心所欲地行動和反應
Every atom acts and reacts as it pleases here.

551
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,580
它們的氧化狀態都發生了變化
The oxidation state of all of them changes.

552
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,790
加二減七加三減一半
Plus two. Minus seven. Plus three. Minus half.

553
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,160
即使氧的氧化狀態也是不固定的
Even the oxidation state of oxygen is not fixed.

554
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,790
當你自己的元素不在乎的時候
When your own elements don't give a damn..

555
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,660
那為什麼要組建一個幸福的周期性家庭? 為什麼？
..then why make a happy periodic family? Why?

556
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,790
學學人家數學
Learn from math. Learn.

557
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,450
零到九是固定的
Zero to nine is fixed once and for all. Final.

558
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,160
但在化學，元素直到現在都是不固定的。
But here, their elements aren't fixed till date.

559
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,700
每年都有新的元素出現
Something new crops up every year.

560
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,120
砰! 113號是今年抽獎的號碼
Boom! Number 113 is the number picked in this year's lucky draw.

561
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,540
我們就把它叫做'鍬'好了
We shall call it! Nikenugium. No, no, no. Nikeniugium!

562
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,750
該死! 背誦梵文咒語都比這容易
Damn it! It is easier to recite a Sanskrit mantra.

563
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
牛頓給了我們三個定律，三個
Newton gave us three laws. Three.

564
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,620
我們物理學的一半都被它覆蓋了
Half our physics is covered with it..

565
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
但在這裏，每個問題都有一個新規則
..but here, there is a new rule for every question.

566
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,080
承認吧，承認你不像物理和數學那樣有邏輯
Admit it. Admit that you are not logical like physics and math.

567
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,790
好吧，吃點...-不！
Okay. Eat some.. - No!

568
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,500
告訴我，這很簡單
Tell me something. It is simple.

569
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,250
如果你把蘋果拋嚮空中會發生什麼？
What will happen if you toss an apple in the air?

570
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,450
它會掉下來-它會掉下來? 對吧？
It will fall. - It will fall? It will fall?

571
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,790
物理學上它會掉下來，但是化學上並不會
But it will fall in physics. It won't fall in chemistry.

572
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,250
化學中會發生什麼? 會有空間位阻
What will happen in chemistry? There will be steric hindrance.

573
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,080
如果這還不夠，那麼共鳴，誘導效應
If that's not enough then resonance, inductive effect.

574
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,790
一切都會發生，任何事都可能發生
Everything will happen. Anything can happen here.

575
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,200
他們甚至不會簡單地命名顔色
They don't even name the colors simply.

576
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,450
綠色不叫綠色，叫蘋果綠，紅色不叫紅色，叫深紅色
It's not green. It's apple green. It's not red. It's crimson red.

577
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,910
粉紅不叫粉紅，叫桃紅！
It's not pink. It's hot pink!

578
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,750
這就是為什麼隻有女孩子才會這麼擅長化學
That's why only girls are so good at chemistry.

579
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,290
還會讓你做無厘頭的事情
They make you do nonsense.

580
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,250
火焰試驗. 鹽分析. 滴定. 佈朗環試驗
Flame test. Salt analysis. Titration. Brown ring test.

581
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,450
還有臭雞蛋的味道，為什麼我要聞到臭雞蛋的味道？
Rotten eggs smell. Why should I smell a rotten egg?

582
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,450
為什麼? 我是個婆羅門（吃素）！
Why? I am a Brahmin!

583
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,830
原子大小趨勢電離勢趨勢
Atomic size trend. Ionization potential trend.

584
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,830
電子親和力趨勢，電子負性趨勢，水平趨勢
Electron-affinity trend. Electron -negativity trend. Horizontal trend.

585
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,830
縱嚮趨勢
Vertical trend.

586
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,000
當你可以預測某事時，你可以把它稱為一種趨勢
You can call something a trend when you can predict something with it.

587
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,830
如果任何時間任何地點發生任何事情，就像“印度斯坦的暴徒”一樣
If anything is happening anywhere and anytime like 'Thugs of Hindustan'..

588
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,200
那他們怎麼能稱之為趨勢呢？
..then how can they call it a trend?

589
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,450
他們怎麼能這麼說？
How can they call it that?

590
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,750
我告訴你，米納
I am telling you, Meena.

591
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,750
化學不是一門學科，它是主觀的
Chemistry is not a subject. It is subjective.

592
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,750
我為這個學科付出了很多
I did so much for this subject.

593
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,620
作業，筆記，卡片，我坐在前排
Assignments, notes, flash cards. I sat in the front row.

594
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,160
換了三個老師，換了學習策略
Changed three teachers. Changed the studying strategy.

595
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,410
但最終的結果是什麼呢? 一無所獲！
But what is the end result? Zilch!

596
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,540
他停不下來了，拜亞哥
He wouldn't stop, Jeetu Bhaiya.

597
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,200
所以我才帶他來見你
That's why I brought him to you.

598
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,200
你的理解是正確的
You have understood it correctly.

599
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,950
問題不在於老師，而在於學科
The problem is not with the teacher, it's with the subject.

600
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
你隻能在大學裏找到物理學家一定是有原因的
There must be some reason you find physicists only in universities..

601
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,160
而你在每個角落都能找到藥劑師
..while you find chemists at every corner.

602
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,830
你知道你不能背那麼多東西，對吧？
You understand that you cannot memorize so much, right?

603
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,040
好吧-但是這個問題要怎麼解決呢，拜亞哥
Fine. - But how does that solve the problem, Bhaiya?

604
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,290
你不知道嗎？-不知道
It isn't? - No.

605
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,120
我認為這很簡單
I thought it was simple.

606
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,160
好吧，假設你要去約會
Okay, let's say you have to go on a date.

607
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,250
你有女朋友嗎?-冇有
You have a girlfriend? - No.

608
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,120
假設你有一個像卡特裏娜這樣的性感女友
Let's assume you have a hot girl like Katrina.

609
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,040
她很準時，八點整打電話給你
Ma'am is punctual. She calls you at 8 o'clock sharp.

610
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,950
如果你要去約會，你會帶一份禮物給她，是嗎？
If you're going on a date you will take a gift for her, won't you?

611
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,910
香檳，花束 -還有粉紅的泰迪玩偶
Champagne, bouquet.. - Teddy bear. Pink.

612
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,080
你的想法非常不同
Your ideas are very different.

613
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,660
無論如何，讓我們假設你拿了一個玩偶
Anyway, let's assume you take a teddy bear.

614
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,040
你在路上碰到一個小偷
You bump into a thief on the way.

615
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,040
他抓起玩偶就跑了
He snatches the teddy bear and runs.

616
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,250
你會怎麼做?-他怎麼能逃跑呢？
What will you do? - How can he run away?

617
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,790
我要抓住他，揍他一頓
I will catch hold of him and punch him.

618
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,500
當然，理想情況下你應該這麼做
Of course. Ideally that's what you should do.

619
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,200
但是小偷很快
But the thief is fast.

620
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,040
現在你手裏還有兩份禮物，然後呢？
And you have two gifts in your hands. Then?

621
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,040
然後我們大聲尖叫，肯定會有人來幫忙的
Then we scream aloud. Someone will surely help.

622
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,250
這可能是一種方法
That could be one approach.

623
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,200
也許會成功，你會怎麼做？
Maybe it will work. What will you do?

624
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,290
我會忘記這個玩偶
I will forget about the gift..

625
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,160
然後帶著剩下的兩個禮物沖過去
..and rush with the remaining two gifts.

626
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,700
所以，趕快！
So, rush!

627
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,200
我告訴過你這很簡單，印度理工是個性感的女孩
I told you it is simple. IIT is the hot gal.

628
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,750
當然花束和香檳是數學和物理
Sure. The bouquet and champagne are math and physics..

629
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,080
. . 而泰迪熊就是
..while the teddy is inorganic chemistry..

630
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,580
我們學不會的化學
..which we are unable to get hold of.

631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,910
但是，拜亞哥，現實生活中的女朋友就是想要泰迪熊
But, Bhaiya, the real life girlfriend wants the teddy.

632
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,250
不學化學我就考不上印度理工學院
I won't get admission into IIT without inorganic.

633
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,200
誰說的？
Who says so?

634
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,080
你們還有誰是印度理工畢業的嗎？
Who is the IITian in this room?

635
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,040
你以為我會像傻瓜一樣背化學嗎？
Do you think I memorized chemistry like a jackass?

636
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,290
在你準備考試之前，先學習考試
Before you study for an exam, study the exam.

637
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,660
你覺得怎麼樣？在這六個小時裏，你需要得多少分才能考上印度理工？
What do you think? How much do you need to score during those six hours to get into top five IITs?

638
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,660
90%-不，不，你瘋了嗎? 肯定要95%才行
90 percent for top five.. - No, no. Are you insane? 95 percent.

639
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,580
95
95 percent.

640
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,370
你們要如何麵對這個野蠻的世界?
How will you face this savage world?

641
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,830
它會把你生吞活剝了，40%
It will eat you alive! 40 percent.

642
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
隻需要40%？
Only 40 percent for top five?

643
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,910
得到40%就能排前五了？
Only 40 percent for top five IIT?

644
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,910
你在開玩笑嗎，拜亞哥？
You are kidding, aren't you, Bhaiyar?

645
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,540
互聯網上有很多東西
There are many things apart from memes on the internet.

646
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,660
去看看非學術的講座視頻： IIT JEE 的戰略
Go and watch videos of Unacademy. Strategy for IIT JEE.

647
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,910
JEE的出題者和科學家會抽出時間為你製作一些視頻
JEE toppers and scientists take time out to make some videos for you.

648
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,450
你拜亞哥我能解決所有問題嗎？
At least do that much. Is your Jeetu Bhaiya going to solve everything?

649
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,390
即使省略教學大綱的60%
Even if omit 60 percent of the syllabus..

650
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,750
你還是有機會進入印度理工學院
..you still stand a chance to get into IIT.

651
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
無機化學的教學大綱可能非常龐大
The syllabus for inorganic chemistry might be vast.

652
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,160
所以，隨它去吧
So, let it be.

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
它在我們的考試中有多重？
How much weightage does it carry in our exam?

654
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,040
化學在我們的考試中會佔多大比重? 告訴我
How much weightage would chemistry carry in our exam? Tell me.

655
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,290
化學是三分之一-33%
Chemistry would be one-third. - 33 percent.

656
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,080
其中三分之一是. .-11%
One third of that would be.. - 11 percent.

657
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,790
想想吧
Think about it.

658
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,870
你想追求這11% 的分數嗎
Do you want to chase 11 percent..

659
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,580
... 弄皺你剛熨好的褲子
..and ruin the crease on your trousers..

660
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,700
還是專註於89% ？
..or focus on 89 percent?

661
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,870
得分40% ，然後享受在印度理工的四年
Score 40 percent and then enjoy in a good IIT for four years.

662
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,830
拜亞哥，我今天要把所有的無機化學書都燒掉
Bhaiya, I shall burn up all the sheets of Inorganic today.

663
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,250
-就這樣!-那樣不對
End of story! - That's wrong.

664
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,950
是的，這是知識，燒書是罪惡的
Yes. It is knowledge. It is a sin.

665
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,370
把它當廢紙賣掉
Sell it as waste paper.

666
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,950
還能換一些錢用它吃零食
You will get some money. Eat some snacks with it.

667
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,950
但是，拜亞哥，化學可以提高名次不是嗎？
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, one can improve one's rank with inorganic, right?

668
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,480
化學提高了那些正在獲得排名的人的排名
Inorganic improves the rank of those who are actually getting a rank.

669
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,950
但在你的情況下，它會讓你失去排名
But in your case, it will leave you rankless.

670
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,330
所以，解決這些問題的最好方法
So, the best way to tackle problems like these..

671
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,700
就是不要摻和進來
..is not to get involved. Just take the fast lane.

672
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,250
你明白嗎? 快點，你們這些家夥，走吧
Do you understand? Come on, you guys. Leave. Leave.

673
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,290
去吧
Go.

674
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,080
你為什麼看起來這麼睏惑，米納？
Why do you look so confused, Meena?

675
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,040
但是，拜亞哥，那天你說..
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, the other day you said..

676
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,250
如果你在生活中遇到睏難，要勇敢麵對
..if you have a problem in life you confront it.

677
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,290
讓你的問題成為挑戰，讓挑戰成為習慣，勇往直前
Make your problem a dare. Make your dare a habit and forge ahead.

678
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,500
今天你卻說讓我們放棄化學
Today you are saying to let Inorganic go if we don't know it.

679
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,540
孩子，無機化學是個例外
Son, Inorganic chemistry is an exception.

680
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,540
走吧，走吧
Come on. Leave.

681
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
謝謝你，拜亞哥
Thank you, Bhaiya.

682
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,160
考試的目標不應該是解決所有的問題
Objective in the exams should not be to solve all the problems..

683
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,040
而是為了解決最多的問題
..but to solve the maximum number of questions.

684
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,870
如果問題是非常睏惑和費時的，他們可以跳過它
If the problem is very confusing and time consuming, they you can skip it.

685
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,750
如果你還有剩餘的時間，再回頭去看
If you have any time remaining then get back to it.

686
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,620
記住，並不是每個問題都是要解決的
Bear in mind, not every problem is meant to be solved.

687
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,370
瓦伊巴夫潘迪!-阿姨？
Vaibhav Pandey! - Aunty?

688
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,800
我告訴過你多少次了，不要扔那麼多衣服
I've told you so many times not to put so many clothes..

689
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,200
在二手洗衣機裏
..in the second hand washing machine.

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
你考慮過水和電嗎？
Do you think about electricity and water?

691
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,040
阿姨
Aunty.

692
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,250
近來可好？
How are you?

693
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,480
拿著這個，這是你的額外費用
Take this. This is your extra charge.

694
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,200
我每個月都會給你
And I shall give it to you every month.

695
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
麻煩您整個月都不要打擾我
Just don't disturb me for the entire month.

696
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,200
謝謝你
Thank you.
