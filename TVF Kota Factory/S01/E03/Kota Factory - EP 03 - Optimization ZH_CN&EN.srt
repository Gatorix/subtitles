阿姨，在我们的房间听不到风扇的声音 -嗯
Aunty, when the sound of our fan can't be heard our room. - Yes.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,500
在你的房间里怎么可能听到声音？

30
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,500
别跟我说你那些物理学理论

So give her the money. - It's not about the money.

38
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,700
拉里塔 · 帕瓦尔！

40
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,160
"他就像我的儿子"
He is like my Bunty.

41
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,540
"我喜欢..." 该死！
I like.. Damn!

42
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,250
即使我不得不关着风扇睡觉
Even if I have to sleep with the fan off..

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,830
我也绝不会给她涨房租的借口
..I won't give her an excuse to increase the rent.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,660
好吧，先别想这个了
Okay. You can think about Tarka later.

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,660
我们去前排抢个位置，让他们看看

Silver Iodide is an ionic compound still it's not soluble in water.

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,830
为什么? 因为这适用于法杨原则
Why? Because Fajan's rule applies here.

52
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
什么是法杨原则?-没有离子化合物是完全离子的
What was it? - No ionic compound is completely ionic..

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,750

Sir, how can the answer to the 14th question be C?

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,910
这不能变成化合物

93
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,450
不符合八隅体规则

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,250
但是，先生，科学不能打破规则

99
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,000
例外是化学的规律
Exception is the rule of chemistry.

100
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,330
明白了吗？

我们都答的很认真
We took this very lightly, bro.

108
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,700
我还以为这是小菜一碟，但其实不是 -是的，兄弟，这当然不是小菜一碟
Thought it's a piece of cake . It isn't. - Yes, bro. It's certainly not a piece of cake.

00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,870
好吗？
Okay?

117
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,750
可以都给我吗?-可以
May I have it all? - You may.

118
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,370
把包装纸给我就好 -谢谢
Just give me the wrapper. - Thank you.

119
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,620

123
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,620
我解决的第四个奖励题

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,950
你能解决奖励题吗？
You can solve the chocolate problem?

125
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,000

What are you saying? - Exactly, don't do it. It is only for the A1 batch.

128

Very promising! Very promising!

138
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450
他们可以解决奖励题
These people can solve the chocolate problem.

139
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,790
A6和我们A5有什么不同？
What is different in their A6 from our A5?

140
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,950
墙壁的颜色，长凳的宽度
The color of the walls. The width of the benches.

141
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,870
粉丝的数量
The number of fans.

142
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,790
还有教职员工
Also, the faculty.

143
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,620
怎么了？
Why?

144
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,370
来吧，我知道了
Come. I'll tell you.

145
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,540
来来来
Come. Come. Come.

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,910
你在干什么? 你疯了吗？
What are you doing? Are you insane?

147
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,580
给他零分，零分
Give him zero. Zero.

148
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,870
如果巴特拉的教学不合格
If Batla's teaching isn't up to the mark..

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,580
我们会给他什么样的反馈？
..what will we give him in the feedback form?

150
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,790
给他零分，对吧？
We will give him a zero, won't we?

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,250
判低分和羞辱学生是老师的事情，而不是学生
Awarding bad marks and humiliating thereafter suits teachers, not students.

152
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,410
这也是来自A5的
That too from A5.

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,200
你这个笨蛋! 如果我们不给出糟糕的反馈
You dork! If we don't give bad feedback..

154
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,580
他只会继续教下去
..he only will continue to teach.

155
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,040
那你怎么学无机物呢？
Then how will you learn inorganic?

156
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,040
老师和家长是平等的
Teachers are equal to parents.

157
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,790
那么你也应该给他们反馈
Then you should give them feedback too.

158
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,040
爸爸，你不是一个称职的父亲
Dad, you are not up to the mark as a father.

159
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,410
以后隔壁王叔叔睡在你的卧室里
Hereafter uncle will sleep in your bedroom.

160
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,040
没道理的，冷静点
That doesn't make sense. Cool down.

161
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,080
去把风扇打开
Go and switch on the fan.

162
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,250
风扇今天不开了
The fan won't be switched on today.

163
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,000
但是我觉得有点热
But I am feeling a little hot.

164
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,160
先填反馈表，然后打开风扇
Fill the form first. Then the fan will be switched on.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,330
我要去喝水
I am going to drink water.

166
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,120
米纳！
Meena!

167
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,700
这是一个领先的时代
There was this 'Dwapar' era..

168
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,370
像德罗纳查里亚这样的大师在过去备受尊敬
..when Gurus like Dronacharya used to be respected.

169
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,120
这就是这个时代……-嘿! 就连阿俊都和德罗纳查里亚打过仗
And here is this era.. - Hey! Even Arjun fought Dronacharya.

170
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,120
你连《罗摩衍那》都没学好
Even your Ramayana is weak..

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,410
德罗纳查里亚先生是有史以来最好的老师
..where as Dronacharya sir was like the best teacher ever.

172
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,830
史上最好的老师！
Bestest teacher ever!

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,830
但他还是和他打了起来，为什么？
And yet he fought with him. Why?

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,540
逮捕阴谋
For seizure of a plot.

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,120
而你甚至不能在反馈表上给巴特拉老师打低分
And you, Meena, can't even fill a single feedback form against Batla for JEE.

176
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,120
如果是我，我会从这里跳下去
If it were me, I'd have leapt from here.

177
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,080
你自己给他低分吧，我不干
Go ahead. Give him bad marks. I won't do it.

178
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,410
好吧
Okay.

179
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,750
好吧，好吧
Okay. Fine. Fine.

180
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,330
你也会像巴特拉一样，烂在一些私立工程学院里
You'll also rot in some private engineering college like that Batla of yours.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,540
考不上印度理工的渣渣
Bloody non-IITians.

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,790
嘿！
Hey!

183
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,580
怎么了?-没什么，阿姨
What's going on? - Nothing, aunty.

184
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,950
水洒出来了
I felt a spray of water.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
你们用饮用水过泼水节呢？
You are playing holi with drinking water?

186
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,830
是的，姨妈 -不，阿姨我们只是……
You are right, aunt. - No, aunty. We were simply.

187
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,830
罚款300
300 rupees will be increased.

188
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,830
阿姨，阿姨-邦蒂！
Aunty. Aunty. - Bunty!

189
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,950
阿姨你听我说，阿姨！
Aunty, listen to me. Aunty!

190
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,120
我就像你儿子邦迪……
I am just like your Bunty.

191
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,080
妈！
Mummy!

192
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
我以后去旁边的研究所取水
I will fill water from the neighboring institute.

193
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,870
我才不会付钱给这个老巫婆! 该死的
But will not pay this witch! Bloody grouch.

194
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,040
拿着，我已经签了名
Take this. I've signed it.

195
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,160
你想怎么写就怎么写吧，混蛋！
Fill what you want in it. Son of a witch!

196
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,410
对不起 -没关系，兄弟
Sorry, pal. - It's okay, bro.

197
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,870
“只有云才能理解大地的渴望”
'Only a cloud understands the thirst of the Earth.'

198
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,410
嘿，库马尔维什瓦斯! 来-去哪里？
Hey, Kumar Vishwas! Come. - Where?

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,000
来吧
Come along.

200
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,410
我们已经给了零分
We have given it..

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,370
但是只有当每个人都他打零分时，巴特拉才会被解职
..but Batla will only be removed when everyone gives bad feedback.

202
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:07,250
“没有朋友的生活有什么意义? ”
"What good is a life with no friends?"

203
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,500
拿着，兄弟，我填好了
Take this, bro. I filled the form.

204
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,870
赶走那个恶棍肖汉！
Remove that scoundrel Chauhan!

205
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,580
教员的名字是巴特拉
The faculty's name is Batla.

206
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,580
肖汉先生是A2的老师，不是 A5
Chauhan sir teaches in A2, not in A5.

207
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,950
哦，糟糕! 我掉到 A5了？
Oh crap! I've fallen till A5?

208
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,290
“不是根据地图，不是根据宗教或需求”
"Not by maps, not by religion or by need."

209
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,450
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

210
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,910
“由你的爱，你的声音和你的崇拜组成”
"Made up of your love, your sound and your worship."

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,870
“我的世界是由朋友组成的”
"My world is made up of friends."

212
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,000
等一下
Just a minute.

213
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,040
不，我不会给出负面的反馈，也不会让你给出负面的反馈
No. Neither will I give a negative feedback and nor will let you give it.

214
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,870
为什么? 他是你叔叔吗?-是的！
Why? Is he your uncle? - Yes!

215
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,540
他是你叔叔?-是的
He is your uncle? - Yes.

216
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,250
家人?-是的，家人
Family? - Yes. Family.

217
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,540
兄弟，教学风格……巴特拉? -零分
Look, bro. Teaching style.. Batla? - Zero.

218
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,000
两分吧，给这个可怜的家伙打个两分
Two. Two. Let's give the poor chap two.

219
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,250
解答能力 -零！
Doubt solving. - Zero!

220
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,000
一分，一分
One. One. One.

221
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,870
个性 -零！
Personality. - Zero!

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,000
零，零，零
Zero. Zero. Zero.

223
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,500
还有守时-零
And punctuality. - Nil.

224
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,000
对不起，我每天午饭前和晚饭后都要背诵一次元素周期表
Sorry. I revise my periodic table once daily before lunch and after dinner.

225
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,330
很好
That's nice.

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,830
非常好！
Very nice!

227
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,410
表格?-哦，反馈表格！
The form? - Oh, feedback form!

228
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,850
我在无机化学课上学得很好，所以不需要填表了
I am doing well in Inorganic so, no need for me to fill it up.

229
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,830
再见，我还要复习所有的原子半径
Well, bye. I have to revise all the atomic radii too.

230
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,750
我们走，瓦巴夫，来吧
Let's go, Vaibhav. Come.

231
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,750
我们在 A5，但我们不是命中注定
We are in A5 but we are not destined..

232
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,580
能像 A6的学生一样解决奖励题
..to be able to solve the chocolate problem like the A6 students.

233
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,000
你说什么？
What did you say?

234
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,250
非常好的主动性！
Very nice initiative!

235
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,290
巴特拉应该换了
Batla should be changed.

236
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,330
事实上，这个培训班的每一位老师都应该换掉
In fact, every teacher in this coaching class should be changed.

237
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,950
不，不，这个行业应该改变
No, no. This coaching industry should change.

238
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,330
考试模式、教学大纲、课程设置
Exam pattern, syllabus, curriculum. Pedagogy should change.

239
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,330
理工学院应该改，整个教育体系都应该改
IIT should change. This whole educational system should change.

240
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,620
为此……
And for that..

241
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,330
应该改变父权制
..patriarchy should change.

242
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,160
你觉得怎么样，施万吉？
What do you think, Shivangi?

243
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,160
我认为你应该先上课
I think you should attend class first.

244
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,370
A1，A2，A3，A4，A5.
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. Inorganic.

245
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,290
无机物下的 AWS 是什么？
What is AWS under inorganic?

246
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,160
阿瓦斯，以后他教我们吗?-什么? 巴特拉走了？
Awasthi. Will he teach us now? - What? Batla is gone?

247
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
他走得很体面
He acted very respectable.

248
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,700
他不是离开的，而是被离开的
He isn't gone. He has been removed.

249
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,620
叔叔
Uncle.

250
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,790
巴特拉先生-你好
Mr. Batla. - Hi.

251
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,540
你好 -好，坐，坐，坐
How are you? - Yes. Sit. Sit. Sit.

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,000
什么风把你吹来了？
So, tell me. What brings you here?

253
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,500
我只是想和你谈谈，先生
I just wanted to talk to you, sir.

254
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,790
嗯，你说吧-先生，我不能继续在A5授课了
Yes, yes. Tell me. - Sir, I've lost A5.

255
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,500
是的-如果您能让我上额外的课来解决疑问的话……
Yes. - If you could let me give extra classes to resolve doubts..

256
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,910
对无机化学课程也有疑问吗? 谁会来上课，先生？
Doubt classes that too of Inorganic? Who will attend, sir?

257
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,750
只要不降低我的工资，我什么都愿意做
Just don't decrease my salary. I will do anything.

258
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,540
给我一个低年级的班
Give me a junior class if you wish.

259
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,500
我还可以教八年级的物理
I can even teach 8th grade physics.

260
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,700
你怎么能这么说? 我们都很尊敬你
How can you say that, sir? You are respectable to us, sir.

261
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,580
不是这样的，先生，当无机化学需要刻苦学习时
Not true, sir. The other subjects are respected..

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,580
其他学科才会收到尊重-是的
..when inorganic demands the most hard work. - Yes.

263
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,450
每天早上都要复习
One has to revise every morning.

264
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,660
然而其他人的工资更高
Yet the others have better salaries.

265
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,370
听着，先生，数学和物理老师都是理工学院毕业的
Look, sir. Math and Physics are taught by IITians.

266
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,000
如果给他们钱少了一定会跳槽的
Pay less to them and other institutes poach them.

267
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,750
这就是姐夫付给他们高薪的原因
That's why brother-in-law pays them so much.

268
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,250
我又能怎么样呢，先生？
What can I do in this matter, sir?

269
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,250
我只能给你侄子提供奖学金，对不对？
I could only offer your nephew a scholarship. Did I or didn't I?

270
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,040
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

271
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
事实上，他并没有得奖学金的资格
When in fact, he didn't deserve it.

272
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,040
但就算是要换掉我，饶先生也是个不错的替代者
But, sir, even if I was to be removed Mr. Rao. would've been a respectable replacement.

273
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,830
或者是 A6的老师帕敏德
Or maybe that teacher of A6. Parminder.

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,120
即使是他也会是一个更好的选择
Even he would have been a better option.

275
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,120
但是，你却用我的下属代替了我
But sir, you replaced me with my junior.

276
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,830
他就是个神经病
You know what, sir? He is a psycho.

277
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,830
他什么都不懂，还经常来听我的课
He doesn't know anything. He used to attend my lectures.

278
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,620
那样的话，你自己也有问题，不是吗？
In that case, sir, even you made a mistake, didn't you?

279
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,500
初级和高级在无机化学里无关紧要
Junior and senior don't matter in inorganic, sir.

280
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,540
总得有人留下，所以我们就留下了他
Someone had to be retained. So, we did.

281
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,620
那个可怜的家伙肯定是个神经病
And that poor chap will be a psycho.

282
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,370
在过去的四个月里，他也一直在家里无所事事
He too has been idling at home for the past 4 months.

283
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,370
他还能再空闲四个月，他有两家旅馆
He can idle another four months. He owns two hostels.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,790
告诉我，先生，如果他是一个真正的老师
Tell me something, sir. If he was a true teacher..

285
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,910
他现在不是应该加入什么教师学院了吗？
..wouldn't he join some coaching institute by now?

286
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,160
你为什么要取笑这个可怜的家伙，先生？
Why are you making fun of the poor chap, sir?

287
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,950
就连你都知道，没有一所学院会挖角化学老师
Even you are aware no institute poaches Inorganic faculty.

288
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,500
站起来! 快点站起来！
Up! Stand up quickly!

289
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,500
如果你不知道这个例外情况，那么到今天为止你都学了什么？
What have you studied till date if you don't know this exception?

290
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,000
今天打电话给你的父母，告诉他们你考不上印度理工
Call your family today and tell them you won't be able to crack IIT.

291
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,800
如果你没有勇气告诉他们，那就下载个抖音
And if you don't have the courage to tell them, then download 'tic tok'.

292
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,500
许多像你这样的混蛋在那里面跳舞，甚至赚得还不少
Many jerks like you dance there and even earn more than they deserve.

293
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,910
我第一个给你点赞
I'll be your first customer. Take this!

294
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,410
15道题才得4分
You scored four out of fifteen.

295
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,790
先生，你们讲解过后面的超纲题吗?-是的
Sir, do you discuss the chocolate problems? - Yes, yes.

296
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,040
我当然知道-那么这个题例外的原因是什么
Of course I do. - So what is the reason for this exception...

297
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,030
但我只和A1的学生讨论
But only with A1 batch students.

298
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,830
因为他们不会像A5学生那样问愚蠢的问题
..because they don't ask stupid questions like A5 students.

299
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,830
"这些都是事实，但是不行"
These are facts, information. But no!

300
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,700
“我们需要逻辑”
"We want logic."

301
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,290
"先生，为什么纸币只有100和50卢比的面额？"
Sir, why do notes only come in 100 and 50 rupee denominations?

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,660
"为什么没有75？"
Why not 75?

303
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,870
"为什么兰比尔选择了阿莉亚? 为什么不是迪皮卡？"
Why did Ranbir choose Alia? Why not Deepika?

304
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,250
你只要记住就可以了
Simply memorize what's written and be done with it.

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,830
但是不行! “我们要逻辑，我们要成为顶级人物”
But no! "We want logic. We want to be toppers."

306
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,330
“先生，你知道为什么我是 A5而不是 A1的吗？
"Sir, do you know why I am a topper from A5 and not from A1?

307
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,450
因为我是蠢驴”
Because I am an ass."

308
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,560
咿哈! 咿哈! 咿哈！
Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

309
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,830
如果你想学好无机化学，那就照我说的做
If you want to learn inorganic then you do as I tell you.

310
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,830
继续背，就这样！
Keep memorizing it. That's that!

311
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,830
毫无疑问
No questions asked.

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,250
大家都明白了吗?-是的，长官！
Everyone got it!? - Yes, sir!

313
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,160
大声说出来-是，长官！
Say it aloud. - Yes, sir!

314
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,330
我听不见-是，长官！
I can't hear you. - Yes, sir!

315
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,790
很好！
Good!

316
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,500
现在我们来看一些97年的真题
Now some questions from JEE '97.

317
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,700
我们可以解出来的
We shall solve them.

318
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,200
这题对你们来说真的很重要
They're really important for you guys.

319
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,200
打开你的笔记本
Remove your note books.

320
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,000
先生，我们有个请求
Sir, we have a request.

321
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,000
你付分期付款了吗?-我们付了，先生！
Have you paid the installment? - We paid it, sir!

322
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,830
我们很久以前就付清了
We paid it long ago.

323
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,330
好吧说吧
Okay, talk.

324
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,580
先生，你..
Sir, you..

325
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,500
先生，化学老师还能换人吗？
Sir, can the Inorganic faculty be changed once again?

326
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,500
可以
Yes.

327
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,910
为什么不呢？
Why not?

328
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,250
明年填写反馈表
Fill the feedback form next year.

329
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,500
就可以换了
It'll be changed.

330
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,790
先生，明年就太晚了，先生
Sir. Next year will be too late, sir.

331
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,950
你为什么不让巴特拉复职呢，先生？
Why don't you reinstate Batla sir?

332
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,620
你们这些没用的家伙就不配填反馈表
You worthless chaps should never be given the feedback forms.

333
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,620
顶尖的学生都没大惊小怪
The toppers never make any fuss.

334
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,950
出去！
Get out!

335
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,250
就这还想考印度理工
They want to be IITians.

336
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,200
米纳尔也很沮丧，先生
Meenal is also frustrated, sir.

337
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,290
她怎么了
What happened to her? - Hee-haw. Hee-haw.

338
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,040
给她打电话
Call Meenal.

339
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,790
你这个白痴! 给我！
You idiot! Give it to me!

340
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,420
我告诉过你很多次了，你要把这个号码牢记在心
I've told you so many times you should know topper's phone numbers by heart.

341
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,450
你好哦，可爱的孩子米纳尔
Hello. Oh sweet child Meenal.

342
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,850
(哭泣)
(sobs)

343
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,700
新来的化学老师有什么问题吗？
Is there any... problem with the new sir?

344
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,370
(哭泣)
(sobs)

345
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,830
告诉我，孩子
Tell me, child.

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,660
是的，先生，有一点
Yes, sir. A little bit.

347
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,660
那你还等什么? 你是今年的头牌
Then why did you wait? You are this year's topper.

348
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,230
头牌？
Topper?

349
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,140
- 女生头牌
- Girls topper.

350
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,250
如果有什么事，你应该立即给我发信息
If anything happens, you should message me immediately.

351
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,410
所以你才有我的私人电话
That's why you have my personal number.

352
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,200
是的，先生我换了手机，所以你的号码弄丢了
Yes, sir. I changed my phone so, your number got misplaced.

353
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,200
来，记好
Take it down.

354
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,000
9862...
9-8-6-2...

355
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,190
我一会儿给你
I'll give it to you later.

356
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,910
好吧
Okay.

357
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,290
把阿瓦斯换到基础班
Put Awasthi in the foundation course.

358
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,250
告诉我，你想要哪个先生？
Tell me. Which sir would you like?

359
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,120
来自 A6的老师
The teacher from A6.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,330
是的，A6的老师
Yes. The teacher from A6.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,790
来自 A6的老师
The teacher from A6.

362
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,040
帕... 米... 德
Par...min...der.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,750
好的-好的
Okay - Yes.

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
好吧
Okay.

365
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
听着，她是这家伙的女朋友
Look. She is this dude's girlfriend..

366
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,540
但是谁在追她? 所有科塔的男孩？
..but who all are chasing her? All the boys in Kota?

367
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,410
哪里来的男孩?-科塔的男孩！
The boys from where? - Boys in Kota!

368
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,830
但是这家伙的女朋友拒绝了所有人，除了“这家伙”
But dude's girlfriend refuses everyone except 'the dude'.

369
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,120
那这家伙算什么?-例外
So what does that make the dude? - Exception.

370
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,000
那他的女朋友是什么？
And what does that make the girlfriend?

371
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,830
无辜的，她爱上那个混蛋了！
Innocent. She fell for that jerk!

372
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,410
我们必须了解这件事的要点
We must understand the gist of the matter.

373
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,540
任何有化学反应的地方都有什么?-例外！
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

374
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,080
非常好! 这很有趣
Very good! This is fun.

375
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,000
所以那家伙在课堂外看到我，说无机化学是危险的
So the dude sees me outside the class and says Inorganic chemistry is dangerous.

376
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,450
这非常复杂
It is very complicated.

377
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,830
我不干了
I will quit.

378
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,620
我说，兄弟，你的女朋友也很复杂
I said, brother, your girlfriend is also complicated.

379
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,140
你会离开她吗？
Do you leave her?

380
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,710
- 不会，你要怎么做?-你会时刻关注她
No. What do you do with her? You pay her attention.

381
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,910
你把注意力集中在她身上，好好跟她说话
You focus on her. You talk to her nicely.

382
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,370
肖纳，莫娜，巴布，杰杜，托纳
Shona. Mona. Babu. Jadu. Tona.

383
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,120
还会叫什么？
What else do you call?

384
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,250
看看，这个听到这个，连坐在后排听课的教师都很专注
Look at that. On hearing it even the Bajrang dal at the back is attentive.

385
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,830
你好，坐直了
Hello. Sit straight.

386
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,160
是的
Yes.

387
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,370
你觉得这很有趣，兄弟
You find it very amusing, bro.

388
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,700
站起来
Stand up.

389
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,620
你有女朋友吗？
You have a girlfriend?

390
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,580
你没有，情理之中
You don't. That's not surprising.

391
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,750
坐下
Sit down.

392
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,040
正如这位小老弟是孤独的，同样，硼也是孤独的
Just as our brother here is alone, similarly boron is alone.

393
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,870
硼缺少电子，但是没有人给它
Boron is short of electrons but nobody is giving it.

394
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,910
那么，我们该怎么办？
So, what will we do?

395
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,540
它会继续独自存在吗？
Will it remain alone?

396
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,870
- 我们的兄弟一个人坐着吗?-不
Is our brother sitting alone? No.

397
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,290
哥哥发现一只和他一模一样的猴子
Brother found a monkey just like him.

398
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,790
他发现了什么?-猴子！
What did he find? - Monkey!

399
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,160
朋友，只有我会说猴子
Friend. Only I will say monkey.

400
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,040
所以硼和自己是一样的
So the boron finds boron like itself..

401
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,450
并与之形成一种联系
..and forms a bond with it.

402
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,200
不是詹姆斯 · 邦德，是连接
Not James Bond. Bond.

403
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,040
当两个朋友结合在一起，这叫什么？
When two friends make a bond what is it called?

404
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,500
它会变成一根香蕉，先生
It will become a banana, sir.

405
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,830
非常好的回答！
Very good answer!

406
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,080
它会形成一个香蕉键
It will form a banana bond.

407
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,910
学者们称之为三中心到两个电子键
The educated people call it three-center to two electron bond.

408
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,080
它叫什么?-三个中心对两个电子键！
What is it called? - Three-center to two electron bond!

409
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,910
不需要记住这个，它不会帮助走进印度理工
No need to remember that. It will not help you clear IIT.

410
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,660
我们的目标是什么?-印度理工
What do we want to clear? - IIT!

411
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,040
非常好！
Very good!

412
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,540
那么你们两个，你们有联系吗？
So you two. Have you formed a bond?

413
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,160
你们之间有联系吗？
Have you formed a bond?

414
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,000
来吧，写在你的书上
Come on. Write in your book.

415
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,870
当两个原子结合形成类似的键时
When two atoms combine to form a bond of similar type..

416
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,040
由于缺乏电子，这种键被称为香蕉键
..due to lack of electrons, the bond is known as banana bond.

417
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,660
孩子们，如果有任何关于香蕉键的问题，我们会做吗？
Children, if there is any question on banana bond, we will do it?

418
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,410
会！
Yes, sir!

419
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,790
也就是说香蕉键?-没问题
That means banana bond? - Is not a problem.

420
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,660
铃声已经响了
The bell has rung.

421
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,660
回去记得做作业，明天再交上来
Everyone will complete their sheets and bring them in tomorrow.

422
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,080
那些没有完成的人会挨我一拳，好吗？
Those who don't complete it will get a punch from me. Okay?

423
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,950
- 再见-先生! 先生! 先生! 我们来唱首歌吧
Bye. - Sir! Sir! Sir! Let's have a song.

424
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,950
一首歌，先生
A song, sir.

425
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,950
是的，先生，一首歌，先生
Yes, sir. A song, sir.

426
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,660
求你了，先生求你了……
Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.

427
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,950
安静！
Silence!

428
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,750
你是来听歌的吗? 让我唱歌？
Are you here to listen to songs? I sing songs?

429
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,080
这是《印度偶像》吗？
Is this 'Indian Idol'?

430
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,000
你们父母花钱送你来是听歌的吗？
Is this why your parents pay your fees?

431
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,830
还让我唱首歌……
Sing a song, sir. Sing a song.

432
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,080
他解释得很清楚，很简单
He explains so well. He made it so easy.

433
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,700
不仅是个好老师，也是个不错的歌手
Apart from being the best teacher he is the best singer also.

434
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,370
A6的同学都是这么说的
The boys from A6 said so.

435
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,370
但是他们从来没有说过他还很幽默-没错
But they never said he makes you laugh so much too. - That's right.

436
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,250
我发誓，如果他不是老师，一定能上脱口秀大会
I swear if he wasn't a teacher he would surely do stand up comedy.

437
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,370
太好了，我们得到了无机化学的杰图·拜亚-是的
Praise the lord. Its like we got the 'Jeetu Bhaiya' of Inorganic chemistry. - Yes.

438
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,950
我清楚地记得整堂课
I remember the whole lecture vividly.

439
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,200
我不需要参考我的笔记就能完成DPP
I won't have to refer to my notes to do the DPP.

440
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,330
真不错，他一边教我们唱歌，这才是课堂应该有的样子
It's nice. He teaches us while singing. That's how the class should be.

441
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,120
今天，我的大脑开始产生化学反应
Today my brain has opened to chemistry.

442
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,120
门已经开了 -我今天开悟了
It's already open. - It has opened today.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,870
我说门已经开了
The door is already open.

444
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,120
把这里的蜘蛛网清理干净
Clean all the cobwebs from here.

445
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,040
把箱子挪开，把所有的垃圾都扔掉
Move the suitcases and throw away all the garbage.

446
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,660
少爷回来了
Welcome, prince.

447
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,200
在我看来，我要从你的押金里面扣除一些卫生费了
It seems to me I'll have to cut money from your security now.

448
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,660
这又是怎么了，阿姨?-这是什么？
What happened now, aunty? - What is this?

449
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:35,750
地板
The floor.

450
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,700
地板上是什么?-你
What is on the floor? - You.

451
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
别跟我耍小聪明
You are being a wise ass.

452
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,450
- 这是什么污渍? -脆皮
What kind of stains are those? Crispy. Crispy.

453
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,450
即使是蜥蜴也不能去除这些污渍
Even lizol can't remove these.

454
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,790
我警告过你，我不想在我的科塔大理石上留下任何痕迹
I am warning you. I am warning you I don't want even a scratch on my Kota marble.

455
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,160
这不是科塔的大理石，这是科塔的石头
This is not Kota marble. It is Kota stone.

456
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,250
你再说一遍？
What did you say to my face?

457
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,370
阿姨，以后我们对你的大理石要比对我们的书更加小心
Aunty, hereafter we shall take more care of your marble than our books.

458
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,370
哦，不
Oh, no.

459
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,370
以后我们每天都要打扫这里
Hereafter we will have daily cleaning here..

460
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,370
你每个月要付500卢比
..and you will have to pay 500 rupees per month for it.

461
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,080
我们走
Let's go.

462
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,370
嘿!-让开，你甚至都没洗澡
Hey! - Get out of my way. You don't even shower.

463
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,030
阿姨，您这也没热水啊
'Aunty, give me hot water.'

464
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,940
肮脏的流氓
Filthy rascals.

465
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,000
我希望我能有这个阿姨的反馈表
I wish I had a feedback form for this Tarka as well.

466
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,120
别管这个了，你现在是个英雄
Never mind Supankha. You are a hero.

467
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,290
如果不是因为你，化学老师也不能换
If it hadn't been for you neither would the inorganic teacher change..

468
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,910
我的运气也不会
..nor would my luck.

469
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
兄弟，我会把我的前两个超纲起奖励作为供品给你
Brother, I will give you my first two chocolates as offerings.

470
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,040
别客气，老弟
Its alright, junior.

471
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,160
来吧，孩子们，把你们的试卷打开，我们现在开始
Come on, children. Remove your sheets. We shall begin now.

472
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:28,200
对答案
I will tell you the answers. Check your answers.

473
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,000
第一题，非常简单的问题，说都不想说了
The first. Very easy question. It's a shame to even discuss it.

474
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,000
答案是A，记好了，然后继续下一题
The answer is A. Mark it and move on. Tally it.

475
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,700
第二题选B
Tell me the second. B. ZnS.

476
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,200
你们谁做过第三题？ 这是一个非常简单的问题
Which of you have done the third? It is a very easy question.

477
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,040
这题口算就能解决，你要是用笔算那就太不应该了
We shall solve it orally. Its a shame if you use your pens.

478
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,200
答案是B
The answer is B.

479
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,250
这是什么? 这么简单的问题简直浪费时间
What is this? Such easy questions. Time waste.

480
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,120
非常基础的问题，答案是C
Even more basic question. C is the answer.

481
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,470
如果你做错了，好好检查一下自己吧
If you got this wrong, get yourself checked.

482
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,090
第四题
Question number 4.

483
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,690
答案是B，非常基础
The answer is B. Very basic.

484
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,750
答案是C 我上节课讲过
The answer is C. I did it in the last class.

485
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,660
你们应该没问题
You should have no problem.

486
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:15,620
第六个问题，让我们回到第八个问题-先生！
Sixth question. Let's go to the eighth question. - Sir!

487
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,200
先生，第七题的答案怎么可能是A?-孩子，那个……
Sir. How can the answer to question 7 be A? - Son, that..

488
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,750
它应该是C，不是吗? -我们先对答案，等下我再讲解
It should be C, shouldn't it? - Let's complete this and then I will..

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,410
不，不，先生，先告诉我
No, no, sir. Tell me this first.

490
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,250
先生，铝是硼家族的
Sir, aluminum is from the boron family.

491
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,620
它也没有电子
It doesn't have electrons either.

492
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,040
因此，它会和另一个类似它自己的物质形成一种联系
So, it will form a bond with another one like itself.

493
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,410
所以它会形成一个香蕉键
So it will make a banana bond.

494
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,080
这个并列的契约是什么？
What is this coordinate covenant bond?

495
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,660
这是个例外，孩子，我在课堂上教过你
That is the exception, son. I taught you that in class.

496
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,040
但是，先生，香蕉键本身就是一个例外
But, sir, the banana bond is an exception in itself.

497
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,410
孩子，这是个例外
Son, this is an exception to the exception.

498
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,750
同学们，我说过化学的第一法则是什么？
Class, what did I say was the first rule of chemistry?

499
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:48,500
任何有化学反应的地方都有什么?-例外！
Anywhere there is chemistry, there is? - Exception!

500
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,500
我们继续
Let's move on.

501
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,040
第八题
The eighth question. D.

502
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,540
别紧张，我们会解决超纲题的
Don't take stress. We will solve the chocolate problem.

503
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,540
嘿，兄弟! 怎么了?-滚开！
Hey, bro! What's up? - Scram!

504
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,540
滚！ 滚！-快走
Scram! Scram! - Go.

505
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,540
他疯了吗？
Is he crazy?

506
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,160
米纳，别再幻想了
Meena, get out of this illusion.

507
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,540
我们不会解开奖励题的
We are not going to get chocolate.

508
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,000
你明白吗? 我们什么也做不了
Do you understand? We won't be able to do anything.

509
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,000
不管换多少老师，我们也做不了什么
We won't be able to do anything no matter how many teachers are changed.

510
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,950
我打听了一下
I made enquiries.

511
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,160
这批 A6级的学生也参加了我们学院的相关课程
The A6 batch students have also taken a corresponddence course of our institute.

512
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:33,250
在做dpp之前，他们就已经学过了
The scoundrels have the solutions before the DPP is discussed.

513
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,080
他们有巧克力，但是他们在考试中没有得分
They get chocolate but they don't score marks in the test.

514
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,540
这就是他们仍然在A6的原因
That's why they are still in A6.

515
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,540
我们为什么不去找个化学私教呢
Why don't we take private classes outside the institute for inorganic.

516
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,500
- 真的?-是的
Really? - Yes.

517
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,410
那又能怎样呢？
And what will we gain from it?

518
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,950
找私教又能怎样？
What will we gain from it? What will we gain?

519
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,950
能帮我们提高成绩，不是吗?
They will teach us well, won't they? Even these people are teaching us well.

520
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,200
米纳，问题不在于老师
Meena, the problem is not with the teachers.

521
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,080
问题在于这个讨厌的学科！
The problem is with this nasty subject!

522
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,330
这是一个无聊透顶的学科！
It is an utterly boring subject!

523
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,540
没有任何逻辑可言
There are only facts that have no logic.

524
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,000
在逻辑的名义下，例外比规则多得多
There are more exceptions than the number of rules in the name of logic.

525
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,080
在第一个八隅律中，他们说应该只有8个电子
In the first octet rule they say there should be only 8 electrons..

526
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,330
但是任何数量的电子都会产生化合物
..but then any number of electrons are making compounds.

527
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,450
四，六，七，八，十
Four. Six. Seven. Eight. Ten.

528
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,000
- 十二个-是的
And Twelve. - Yes.

529
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,160
一个原子有这么多模型
One atom has so many models.

530
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,950
首先他们教你道尔顿的模型
First they teach you Dalton's model.

531
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,080
当你明白的时候，他们会说，“哦，这是不正确的”
The moment you understand it they say, "Oh, this is incorrect."

532
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,450
好吧，假设他们犯了一次错误
Alright. Let's say they made a mistake once.

533
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,120
然后他们教你汤普森梅子布丁模型，即使这是错误的
Then they teach you Thompson plum pudding model. Even that is wrong.

534
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,370
然后他们教你卢瑟福模型，然而这也是不正确的
Then they teach you Rutherford model. Even that is incorrect.

535
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,200
那你为什么要教我们？
Then why are you teaching us?

536
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,410
坐下来，别急
Make it first. Sit down and make it.

537
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,290
我们会教你的
No, no, no. We will teach you.

538
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,950
我们会教你波尔的模型
We will teach you. Bohr's model.

539
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,000
海森堡模型
Heisenberg model.

540
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,200
没有一个是完全正确的
None of them are entirely correct.

541
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,910
他们说这是例外，完全是在愚弄我们
These people are making fools of us by calling it exception.

542
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,370
这不是例外，而是借口，纯粹的借口
This is not an exception. It is an excuse. Pure excuse.

543
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,540
他们并没有给出解题的理论依据
They don't have a theory that gives you all the answers.

544
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,540
他们怎么会有理论? 告诉我，他们怎么会有理论？
And how could they have a theory? Tell me. How could they have it?

545
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,540
像爱因斯坦和牛顿这样的天才提出了理论
Geniuses like Einstein and Newton gave theories.

546
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,870
他们从不学这种低能的学科
They never read this moronic subject.

547
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,120
这没有逻辑
There's no logic.

548
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,040
他们只有例外，和更多的例外
All they have is exception, exception and exception.

549
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,120
《盗梦空间》并没有像这些意外那样让我感到困惑
'Inception' did not confuse me as much as exception has.

550
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,540
在这里，每个原子都可以随心所欲地行动和反应
Every atom acts and reacts as it pleases here.

551
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,580
它们的氧化状态都发生了变化
The oxidation state of all of them changes.

552
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,790
加二减七加三减一半
Plus two. Minus seven. Plus three. Minus half.

553
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,160
即使氧的氧化状态也是不固定的
Even the oxidation state of oxygen is not fixed.

554
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,790
当你自己的元素不在乎的时候
When your own elements don't give a damn..

555
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,660
那为什么要组建一个幸福的周期性家庭? 为什么？
..then why make a happy periodic family? Why?

556
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,790
学学人家数学
Learn from math. Learn.

557
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:27,450
零到九是固定的
Zero to nine is fixed once and for all. Final.

558
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,160
但在化学，元素直到现在都是不固定的。
But here, their elements aren't fixed till date.

559
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,700
每年都有新的元素出现
Something new crops up every year.

560
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,120
砰! 113号是今年抽奖的号码
Boom! Number 113 is the number picked in this year's lucky draw.

561
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,540
我们就把它叫做'锹'好了
We shall call it! Nikenugium. No, no, no. Nikeniugium!

562
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,750
该死! 背诵梵文咒语都比这容易
Damn it! It is easier to recite a Sanskrit mantra.

563
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
牛顿给了我们三个定律，三个
Newton gave us three laws. Three.

564
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,620
我们物理学的一半都被它覆盖了
Half our physics is covered with it..

565
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,500
但在这里，每个问题都有一个新规则
..but here, there is a new rule for every question.

566
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,080
承认吧，承认你不像物理和数学那样有逻辑
Admit it. Admit that you are not logical like physics and math.

567
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,790
好吧，吃点...-不！
Okay. Eat some.. - No!

568
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,500
告诉我，这很简单
Tell me something. It is simple.

569
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,250
如果你把苹果抛向空中会发生什么？
What will happen if you toss an apple in the air?

570
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,450
它会掉下来-它会掉下来? 对吧？
It will fall. - It will fall? It will fall?

571
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,790
物理学上它会掉下来，但是化学上并不会
But it will fall in physics. It won't fall in chemistry.

572
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,250
化学中会发生什么? 会有空间位阻
What will happen in chemistry? There will be steric hindrance.

573
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,080
如果这还不够，那么共鸣，诱导效应
If that's not enough then resonance, inductive effect.

574
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:13,790
一切都会发生，任何事都可能发生
Everything will happen. Anything can happen here.

575
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,200
他们甚至不会简单地命名颜色
They don't even name the colors simply.

576
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,450
绿色不叫绿色，叫苹果绿，红色不叫红色，叫深红色
It's not green. It's apple green. It's not red. It's crimson red.

577
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,910
粉红不叫粉红，叫桃红！
It's not pink. It's hot pink!

578
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,750
这就是为什么只有女孩子才会这么擅长化学
That's why only girls are so good at chemistry.

579
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,290
还会让你做无厘头的事情
They make you do nonsense.

580
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,250
火焰试验. 盐分析. 滴定. 布朗环试验
Flame test. Salt analysis. Titration. Brown ring test.

581
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,450
还有臭鸡蛋的味道，为什么我要闻到臭鸡蛋的味道？
Rotten eggs smell. Why should I smell a rotten egg?

582
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,450
为什么? 我是个婆罗门（吃素）！
Why? I am a Brahmin!

583
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,830
原子大小趋势电离势趋势
Atomic size trend. Ionization potential trend.

584
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,830
电子亲和力趋势，电子负性趋势，水平趋势
Electron-affinity trend. Electron -negativity trend. Horizontal trend.

585
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,830
纵向趋势
Vertical trend.

586
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,000
当你可以预测某事时，你可以把它称为一种趋势
You can call something a trend when you can predict something with it.

587
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,830
如果任何时间任何地点发生任何事情，就像“印度斯坦的暴徒”一样
If anything is happening anywhere and anytime like 'Thugs of Hindustan'..

588
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,200
那他们怎么能称之为趋势呢？
..then how can they call it a trend?

589
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,450
他们怎么能这么说？
How can they call it that?

590
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,750
我告诉你，米纳
I am telling you, Meena.

591
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,750
化学不是一门学科，它是主观的
Chemistry is not a subject. It is subjective.

592
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,750
我为这个学科付出了很多
I did so much for this subject.

593
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,620
作业，笔记，卡片，我坐在前排
Assignments, notes, flash cards. I sat in the front row.

594
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,160
换了三个老师，换了学习策略
Changed three teachers. Changed the studying strategy.

595
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,410
但最终的结果是什么呢? 一无所获！
But what is the end result? Zilch!

596
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,540
他停不下来了，拜亚哥
He wouldn't stop, Jeetu Bhaiya.

597
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,200
所以我才带他来见你
That's why I brought him to you.

598
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,200
你的理解是正确的
You have understood it correctly.

599
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,950
问题不在于老师，而在于学科
The problem is not with the teacher, it's with the subject.

600
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
你只能在大学里找到物理学家一定是有原因的
There must be some reason you find physicists only in universities..

601
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,160
而你在每个角落都能找到药剂师
..while you find chemists at every corner.

602
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,830
你知道你不能背那么多东西，对吧？
You understand that you cannot memorize so much, right?

603
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,040
好吧-但是这个问题要怎么解决呢，拜亚哥
Fine. - But how does that solve the problem, Bhaiya?

604
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,290
你不知道吗？-不知道
It isn't? - No.

605
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,120
我认为这很简单
I thought it was simple.

606
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,160
好吧，假设你要去约会
Okay, let's say you have to go on a date.

607
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,250
你有女朋友吗?-没有
You have a girlfriend? - No.

608
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,120
假设你有一个像卡特里娜这样的性感女友
Let's assume you have a hot girl like Katrina.

609
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,040
她很准时，八点整打电话给你
Ma'am is punctual. She calls you at 8 o'clock sharp.

610
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,950
如果你要去约会，你会带一份礼物给她，是吗？
If you're going on a date you will take a gift for her, won't you?

611
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,910
香槟，花束 -还有粉红的泰迪玩偶
Champagne, bouquet.. - Teddy bear. Pink.

612
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,080
你的想法非常不同
Your ideas are very different.

613
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,660
无论如何，让我们假设你拿了一个玩偶
Anyway, let's assume you take a teddy bear.

614
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,040
你在路上碰到一个小偷
You bump into a thief on the way.

615
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,040
他抓起玩偶就跑了
He snatches the teddy bear and runs.

616
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,250
你会怎么做?-他怎么能逃跑呢？
What will you do? - How can he run away?

617
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,790
我要抓住他，揍他一顿
I will catch hold of him and punch him.

618
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,500
当然，理想情况下你应该这么做
Of course. Ideally that's what you should do.

619
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,200
但是小偷很快
But the thief is fast.

620
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,040
现在你手里还有两份礼物，然后呢？
And you have two gifts in your hands. Then?

621
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,040
然后我们大声尖叫，肯定会有人来帮忙的
Then we scream aloud. Someone will surely help.

622
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,250
这可能是一种方法
That could be one approach.

623
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,200
也许会成功，你会怎么做？
Maybe it will work. What will you do?

624
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,290
我会忘记这个玩偶
I will forget about the gift..

625
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,160
然后带着剩下的两个礼物冲过去
..and rush with the remaining two gifts.

626
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,700
所以，赶快！
So, rush!

627
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,200
我告诉过你这很简单，印度理工是个性感的女孩
I told you it is simple. IIT is the hot gal.

628
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,750
当然花束和香槟是数学和物理
Sure. The bouquet and champagne are math and physics..

629
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,080
. . 而泰迪熊就是
..while the teddy is inorganic chemistry..

630
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,580
我们学不会的化学
..which we are unable to get hold of.

631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,910
但是，拜亚哥，现实生活中的女朋友就是想要泰迪熊
But, Bhaiya, the real life girlfriend wants the teddy.

632
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,250
不学化学我就考不上印度理工学院
I won't get admission into IIT without inorganic.

633
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,200
谁说的？
Who says so?

634
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,080
你们还有谁是印度理工毕业的吗？
Who is the IITian in this room?

635
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,040
你以为我会像傻瓜一样背化学吗？
Do you think I memorized chemistry like a jackass?

636
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,290
在你准备考试之前，先学习考试
Before you study for an exam, study the exam.

637
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,660
你觉得怎么样？在这六个小时里，你需要得多少分才能考上印度理工？
What do you think? How much do you need to score during those six hours to get into top five IITs?

638
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,660
90%-不，不，你疯了吗? 肯定要95%才行
90 percent for top five.. - No, no. Are you insane? 95 percent.

639
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,580
95
95 percent.

640
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,370
你们要如何面对这个野蛮的世界?
How will you face this savage world?

641
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,830
它会把你生吞活剥了，40%
It will eat you alive! 40 percent.

642
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
只需要40%？
Only 40 percent for top five?

643
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,910
得到40%就能排前五了？
Only 40 percent for top five IIT?

644
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,910
你在开玩笑吗，拜亚哥？
You are kidding, aren't you, Bhaiyar?

645
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,540
互联网上有很多东西
There are many things apart from memes on the internet.

646
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,660
去看看非学术的讲座视频： IIT JEE 的战略
Go and watch videos of Unacademy. Strategy for IIT JEE.

647
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,910
JEE的出题者和科学家会抽出时间为你制作一些视频
JEE toppers and scientists take time out to make some videos for you.

648
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,450
你拜亚哥我能解决所有问题吗？
At least do that much. Is your Jeetu Bhaiya going to solve everything?

649
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,390
即使省略教学大纲的60%
Even if omit 60 percent of the syllabus..

650
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,750
你还是有机会进入印度理工学院
..you still stand a chance to get into IIT.

651
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,000
无机化学的教学大纲可能非常庞大
The syllabus for inorganic chemistry might be vast.

652
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,160
所以，随它去吧
So, let it be.

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
它在我们的考试中有多重？
How much weightage does it carry in our exam?

654
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,040
化学在我们的考试中会占多大比重? 告诉我
How much weightage would chemistry carry in our exam? Tell me.

655
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,290
化学是三分之一-33%
Chemistry would be one-third. - 33 percent.

656
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,080
其中三分之一是. .-11%
One third of that would be.. - 11 percent.

657
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,790
想想吧
Think about it.

658
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:33,870
你想追求这11% 的分数吗
Do you want to chase 11 percent..

659
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,580
... 弄皱你刚熨好的裤子
..and ruin the crease on your trousers..

660
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,700
还是专注于89% ？
..or focus on 89 percent?

661
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,870
得分40% ，然后享受在印度理工的四年
Score 40 percent and then enjoy in a good IIT for four years.

662
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,830
拜亚哥，我今天要把所有的无机化学书都烧掉
Bhaiya, I shall burn up all the sheets of Inorganic today.

663
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,250
-就这样!-那样不对
End of story! - That's wrong.

664
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,950
是的，这是知识，烧书是罪恶的
Yes. It is knowledge. It is a sin.

665
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,370
把它当废纸卖掉
Sell it as waste paper.

666
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,950
还能换一些钱用它吃零食
You will get some money. Eat some snacks with it.

667
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,950
但是，拜亚哥，化学可以提高名次不是吗？
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, one can improve one's rank with inorganic, right?

668
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,480
化学提高了那些正在获得排名的人的排名
Inorganic improves the rank of those who are actually getting a rank.

669
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,950
但在你的情况下，它会让你失去排名
But in your case, it will leave you rankless.

670
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,330
所以，解决这些问题的最好方法
So, the best way to tackle problems like these..

671
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,700
就是不要掺和进来
..is not to get involved. Just take the fast lane.

672
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,250
你明白吗? 快点，你们这些家伙，走吧
Do you understand? Come on, you guys. Leave. Leave.

673
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,290
去吧
Go.

674
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,080
你为什么看起来这么困惑，米纳？
Why do you look so confused, Meena?

675
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,040
但是，拜亚哥，那天你说..
But, Jeetu Bhaiya, the other day you said..

676
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,250
如果你在生活中遇到困难，要勇敢面对
..if you have a problem in life you confront it.

677
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,290
让你的问题成为挑战，让挑战成为习惯，勇往直前
Make your problem a dare. Make your dare a habit and forge ahead.

678
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,500
今天你却说让我们放弃化学
Today you are saying to let Inorganic go if we don't know it.

679
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:30,540
孩子，无机化学是个例外
Son, Inorganic chemistry is an exception.

680
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,540
走吧，走吧
Come on. Leave.

681
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
谢谢你，拜亚哥
Thank you, Bhaiya.

682
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:45,160
考试的目标不应该是解决所有的问题
Objective in the exams should not be to solve all the problems..

683
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,040
而是为了解决最多的问题
..but to solve the maximum number of questions.

684
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,870
如果问题是非常困惑和费时的，他们可以跳过它
If the problem is very confusing and time consuming, they you can skip it.

685
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,750
如果你还有剩余的时间，再回头去看
If you have any time remaining then get back to it.

686
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,620
记住，并不是每个问题都是要解决的
Bear in mind, not every problem is meant to be solved.

687
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,370
瓦伊巴夫潘迪!-阿姨？
Vaibhav Pandey! - Aunty?

688
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,800
我告诉过你多少次了，不要扔那么多衣服
I've told you so many times not to put so many clothes..

689
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,200
在二手洗衣机里
..in the second hand washing machine.

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,200
你考虑过水和电吗？
Do you think about electricity and water?

691
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,040
阿姨
Aunty.

692
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,250
近来可好？
How are you?

693
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,480
拿着这个，这是你的额外费用
Take this. This is your extra charge.

694
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,200
我每个月都会给你
And I shall give it to you every month.

695
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,200
麻烦您整个月都不要打扰我
Just don't disturb me for the entire month.

696
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,200
谢谢你
Thank you.
