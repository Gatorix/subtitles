1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,186
无赖！
Scoundrel!

2
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,220
你应该提前告诉我们的
You should have atleast told us.

3
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:23,382
告诉你什么？
Told you what?

4
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,669
祝你生日快乐，瓦伊巴夫
Best wishes on your birthday, Vaibhav.

5
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,669
我永远不会忘记我们第一次见面的情景
I will never forget the first time we met.

6
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,076
你站在走廊里又饿又渴，而我..
You were standing there hungry and thirsty in the corridor and I..

7
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:34,101
-不是…… -听我说完
It's not.. - Let me complete.

8
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:35,669
第一眼看到你，我就觉得我在前往计算机科学的旅程中
At first sight I felt I'd found my companion..

9
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:39,108
找到了同伴
..on the journey to IT Bombay Computer science.

10
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,021
米纳，今天不是我的生日
Meena, it is not my birthday.

11
00:00:44,622 --> 00:00:46,911
你们有钱人随时都可以吃蛋糕吗？
Do you rich people eat cake whenever you want?

12
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:52,782
我去马赫什瓦里看了瓦蒂卡的考试成绩
I went to Maheshwari to check on Vartika's results.

13
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:55,549
路上碰到一家蛋糕店，所以我就买了一个蛋糕
I came across a bakery on the way so, I bought a cake.

14
00:00:56,417 --> 00:00:58,216
如果我告诉她这个好消息，她会很高兴的
She would be happy when I'd tell her the good news.

15
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,509
她会称赞我，让我觉得自己是个英雄
She would give me credit. I will feel like a hero.

16
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:01,899
然后你就可以亲她了
And you will get to kiss her.

17
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:04,176
对吧，兄弟? 一定是这样，然后呢？
Right, bro? You were right. Then?

18
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:09,015
然后……我看到成绩了
What then? I saw the results.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,389
瓦蒂卡没考过，我过了
Vartika didn't make it. I did.

20
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:12,663
你仔细看成绩单了吗？
Did you check the results thoroughly?

21
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,389
我从上到下看了八遍
Eight times. From up to down.

22
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:17,809
你教了她那么多，但她还是没通过？
You taught her so much, bro, and yet she didn't make it?

23
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,087
她可真笨
She's a very dumb girl..

24
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:21,825
不过很适合做女朋友
..but good choice for girlfriend.

25
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:24,966
不，很多同学都参加了考试
No. Many students sat for the exam. Somesh. Shubham.

26
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,170
阿洛克，尤察夫，他们的名字都在名单上
Alok. Utsav. All their names were on the list.

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,509
-我们班的尤察夫?-是的
Our Shubham? - Yes.

28
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:31,509
马赫什瓦里这批只招80人
Maheshwari has batches of 80 students.

29
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:34,295
如果招200人，那瓦蒂卡才能通过
If they had batches of 200 students then Vartika would have made it.

30
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,853
你在哪个组?-A3
Which batch did you get? - A3.

31
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:41,392
太好了! 如果老师都没能进入第一组
Great! When the teacher didn't make it to the first batch..

32
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:43,719
他怎么能指望他的学生进去呢？
..how can he expect his student to get selected?

33
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:45,758
你就像巴特拉
You are just like Batla.

34
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,185
-嘿! 就连布吉扬都能考到A3了 -天啊！
Hey! Even Abhigyan made it in A3. - Oh!

35
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:50,628
那边的A3级学生有80%的可能性
The A3 students in over there have 80 percent probability..

36
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,908
考上印度理工
..of getting selected to JEE.

37
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,268
我不是故意参加考试的
I didn't mean to sit for the exam.

38
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,565
有什么问题吗？
What is the problem?

39
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:56,961
她没通过也许是件好事
It's a good thing she did not make it.

40
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,264
怎么个好法？
How is it good?

41
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,196
怎么会好呢? 她坐在房间里一定很伤心
How is it good? She must be very sad, sitting in room.

42
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:04,819
看到她难过，我会感到很难过
It will make me feel very bad to see her sad.

43
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,029
别管什么英雄时刻了，我没有勇气去看她
Never mind the hero moment, I don't have the nerve to go see her.

44
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,962
你已经进入了 A1，但是你仍然保持着 A10的心态
You have made it to A1 but you have the same old A10 mentality.

45
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,421
有点远见，不要总想着现在
Be a little foresighted. Don't think about the present.

46
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,029
想想未来
Think about the future.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,029
听着，如果她通过了，她就会去维吉安纳加尔
Look, if she had made it, she would have gone to Vigyan Nagar.

48
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,405
而你被困在这里
You would be stuck in Talwandi.

49
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:22,016
你们每天要怎么见面？
How would you meet on a daily basis?

50
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,351
你来科塔已经四个月了，对吧？
It's been four months since you came to Kota, right?

51
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,865
你去过几次维吉安纳加尔？
How many times have you been to Vidyanagar?

52
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,500
我们可以折中的地点见面
We could meet midway somewhere.

53
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:30,668
当然，你每次都能去，但她又能来几次
Sure, you would go. She wouldn't come time and again.

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,494
你很幸运
You were lucky.

55
00:02:33,252 --> 00:02:34,301
看，现在你可以练习化学了
Look, now you can practice chemistry..

56
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,027
在这里悠闲地度过一年
..in the streets of Talwandi at leisure through the year.

57
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:38,565
赢得她的芳心
Win her heart.

58
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,641
然后，你们就能像乌代所说的那样了
Then if you wish you can do what Uday said as well.

59
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:42,935
该死！
Crap!

60
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,179
米纳，你越来越聪明了
Meena, you have become very smart.

61
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:47,789
当然，我可不是无缘无故进入 A1的
Of course. I'm not in A1 without reason.

62
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,288
太棒了！
Wonderful!

63
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,718
怎么样，兄弟们？
What do you say, brothers?

64
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:54,789
可以吃蛋糕了吗?-好的，当然
Shall we have cake? - Yes, yes. Of course.

65
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,630
-我已经七年没吃蛋糕了-吃吧
It has been seven years since I had cake. - Eat.

66
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,904
教务处打来的电话
It's a call from the coaching class.

67
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,581
又没到缴费的时间，他们为什么现在打电话来？
We still have time to pay the fees. Why are they calling now?

68
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:07,788
你好
Hello.

69
00:03:15,993 --> 00:03:17,739
什么?-什么？
What? - What?

70
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:22,908
我还以为你在难过-不，我没事
I thought you'd be mourning. - No. I'm okay.

71
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,545
是的，当我看到面包和果酱的时候我就知道了
Yes, I could tell when I saw the bread and jam.

72
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:27,070
但是，怎么这么冷静？
But so chill?

73
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,203
你很放松，因为你的英雄通过了，对吗？
You are relaxed because your hero made it, right?

74
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,502
听着，我为他感到高兴，但他不是英雄
Listen. I'm happy for him that he made it but he's no hero.

75
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:38,228
我真搞不懂你们
I've never understood you girls till date.

76
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:40,573
如果你喜欢这个男孩，那就去跟他表白啊
If you like the boy, then go and propose to him.

77
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:45,228
就不，我们先偷偷地搞暧昧，然后等他来表白
No. First we will romance secretly. Then we wait for him to propose.

78
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,229
然后我再考虑答不答应
Following which we shall think whether to say yes or no.

79
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,451
等一下，我为什么要表白？
Just a minute. Why should I propose?

80
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:54,149
你喜欢那个男孩?-你又开始那样了
You like the boy? - You're back to that again.

81
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,043
去把这个交给瓦伊巴夫
Go and give this lecture to Vaibhav.

82
00:03:56,124 --> 00:03:59,509
时代变了，姐妹，你喜欢的那种男人
Those times are gone, madam The kind of guy you like..

83
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,696
在你的情况下，你要向他表白并且亲吻他
..in your case you will have to propose and initiate the first kiss as well.

84
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:06,497
-说得好像你会跟乌代表白似的?-我会的，我觉得没问题
Like you proposed to Uday? - I would. I see no problem in it..

85
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:09,029
但我不需要，乌代可不是胆小鬼
..but I didn't need to. He isn't that pussy.

86
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,989
好吧，如果他是个胆小鬼，那就随他去吧
Alright. If he is such a pussy then let it be.

87
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,622
你怀疑吗? 不要怀疑了
You are in doubt? Don't remain doubtful.

88
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,108
他会答应的，他对你非常感兴趣
He will say yes. He's highly interested.

89
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:21,668
乌代告诉你了？
Uday told you?

90
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,255
姐妹，你觉得为什么《复活节快乐》这么受欢迎？
Madam, why do you think Shivangi Renawat is so popular in 'Paschim Vihar"?

91
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:31,514
因为她能嗅到浪漫的气息
Because she can sniff romance.

92
00:04:32,091 --> 00:04:32,997
而且乌代也告诉了我
And Uday told me as well.

93
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,947
听着，如果你愿意，你可以采纳我的建议，但我没有强迫你
Look, you take my advice if you wish but there is no compulsion.

94
00:04:35,027 --> 00:04:36,469
等等，乌代跟你说了什么？
Listen. What did Uday say to you?

95
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:08,219
先生，我们没有什么特别的理由去参加考试
Sir, we didn't have any particular reason to sit for the exams.

96
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:15,042
六个小时，第一卷，第二卷，一共240道题
Six hours. Paper one. Paper two. 240 questions.

97
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,892
还说没什么特别的理由？
All of you sat for them for no particular reason?

98
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,789
真不错！
Bravo!

99
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,589
是的，先生，我也没有特别的理由
Yes, sir. Even I had no particular reason for it.

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,338
我们将与参加马赫什瓦里考试的同一批学生在JEE考试中竞争
We will be competing in JEE with the same students who sit for Maheshwari's test.

101
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:30,029
知己知彼，百战不殆
Sir, one should know who one is competing with.

102
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:33,189
-这就是我去参加考试的原因 -俺也一样
That's why I sat for it. - Yes, that is the correct reason.

103
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:35,733
我的意思是，这也是我的理由，先生
I mean to say that is my reason too, sir.

104
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:36,869
我也没有其他特殊的原因
Even I sat for it without reason, sir.

105
00:05:37,185 --> 00:05:37,869
你也是？
You too?

106
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:41,029
先生，他是故意去考的，他还提前30分钟到达考场
Sir, he was deliberate. He reached there 30 minutes early.

107
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,703
而且他不是一个人去的，他还带他妹妹参加了考试
And he did not go alone. He even got his sister to sit for the exam.

108
00:05:44,326 --> 00:05:45,326
她不是我妹妹
She is not my sister.

109
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,989
你在想什么，瓦伊巴夫·潘迪？
What were you thinking, Vaibhav Pandey?

110
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:54,480
我们优秀的学生都去参加了马赫什瓦里的入学考试
Our top students will go to sit for Maheshwari's entrance test..

111
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,149
而我们却不知道？
..and we wouldn't know?

112
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:00,316
你到底有什么问题？
What is your problem anyway?

113
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,395
为什么不跟我说
You don't talk to me.

114
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,979
你们都是真正的天才
All of you are the real prodigies .

115
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:08,301
我们所有人都支持你
All of us are here for you.

116
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,863
我之前也说过，只有A1组的学生都是我的强盗
I've said this earlier as well. A1 students are my rankers.

117
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:13,309
其他的学生都是我的提款机
The rest are my bankers.

118
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:15,081
我根本不在乎他们
I don't care about them.

119
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:19,109
告诉我，舒伯汉，你有什么问题吗？
Tell me, Shubham. What problem do you have here?

120
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,933
阿洛克？
Alok?

121
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:24,600
瓦伊巴夫？
Vaibhav?

122
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:28,935
神童的课程有什么问题？
What is so wrong at Prodigy classes?

123
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,712
你们有什么建议吗？
Do you guys have any suggestions?

124
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:34,389
真的没问题吗？
You have no problem?

125
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,027
好吧，那你们告诉我那边有什么好的
Alright. Tell me what's good over there.

126
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:41,226
有吗？
What is better over there?

127
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:53,097
听着，无论你在这还是在那边，都能考上
Look. You will be selected either here or there.

128
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,907
但在这里，你们将成为最佳人选
But here you will be toppers.

129
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,512
还会得到一份奖品
You will receive a prize.

130
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:01,001
我们甚至为前十名支付了印度理工的学费
We even pay the IIT fees of the top ten rankers here.

131
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,629
我们做的市场营销比他们多得多
We do far more marketing than them.

132
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:07,959
看看他
Look at him.

133
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:09,628
里茹·加那
Rijul Jain.

134
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:12,309
他的全印度排名是19
His All India Rank was 19.

135
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,801
我们把这张脸贴满了全城
We plastered his face all over the city.

136
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:17,090
给了他一辆宝马
We gave him a BMW.

137
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,770
把他捧成了明星
We made him a star.

138
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,311
明星！
Star.

139
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,426
他18岁时收到了四份求婚书
He received four proposals at the age of 18.

140
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:25,665
这些都不能吸引你们吗？
Is that a small feat?

141
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:32,412
他们会打印这么大的照片吗？
Will they print such big photos?

142
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:34,758
他们只会印一个小的
They will print a tiny one.

143
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,044
听着，孩子们，如果你们现在换培训班，你们的日常生活就会受到影响
Look, boys. If you shift there now, your routine will suffer.

144
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:45,139
另外，他们只会专注于从11年级
Plus they will focus on their toppers..

145
00:07:45,305 --> 00:07:46,349
就入学的顶尖的学生
..who have been with them since the 11th grade.

146
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:49,669
我知道索梅什的弱点是S块
Over here I know that Somesh is weak with S block.

147
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,628
瓦伊巴夫的平衡学的不好
Vaibhav's Equilibrium is haywire.

148
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,493
所以我会给你们补课
So I'll take extra classes.

149
00:07:54,147 --> 00:07:55,554
给你们留作业
I'll give them practice question papers.

150
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:58,334
我会解决你们的疑惑
I will solve their doubts.

151
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:01,349
你们会在那边能有这样的待遇吗? 告诉我
Are you going to receive such personal care over there? Tell me.

152
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,780
-能吗?-不能，先生
Will you? - Yes, sir.

153
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,316
我明白，我不去
I understand. I won't go.

154
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,760
如果你们还有任何疑问的话，现在告诉我？
Ask me now if you have any doubts?

155
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,892
告诉我
Tell me.

156
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:11,760
大家都确定吗?-是的，先生！
Is everyone sure? - Yes, sir!

157
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,861
我是说，我也是，哦不，我也不是，我不去，先生
I mean, me too, sir. Me neither, sir. Not going, sir.

158
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,287
你们付了12年级的学费吗？
Did you pay the fees for 12th grade?

159
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,914
-还没有，但我们会付的 -先生，我爸爸会付款的
No, sir. I have to. - Sir, dad will do so.

160
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:25,352
我们会付钱的，先生
It will be paid, sir.

161
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,298
我们会付钱的，先生
We'll pay it, sir.

162
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:31,237
如果你还没有付款，也没关系，如果你已经付了，不用担心
If haven't paid, it is okay and if you have paid it, don't worry.

163
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,907
我们会退款的
We will refund it.

164
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,482
A1组额外提供20% 奖学金
20 percent extra scholarships for the A1 batch.

165
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,328
如果你去那儿，你就得付更高的费用
If you go there you will have to pay higher fees..

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,428
而留在这里我们给你发奖学金
..whereas we are giving you scholarships over here.

167
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:44,240
好吗？
Okay?

168
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,314
好吧，把小册子给他们
Fine. Give them the booklets.

169
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:51,812
还有我的电话号码也给他们
Give all of them my number too.

170
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,131
我的个人号码
My personal number.

171
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:00,070
还有问题吗？
Okay?

172
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:02,429
好吧，解散
Well, alright. Dismiss.

173
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:05,237
- 谢谢，先生-谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

174
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:09,880
对不起，先生
Sorry, sir.

175
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:19,424
你有他们所有人的名单，是吗？
You have a list of all their names, don't you?

176
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,005
打电话给他们的父母
Call their parents.

177
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:27,060
我们帮助他们通过 NTSE，KVPY 和奥林匹克
We help them get through NTSE, KVPY and Olympiad..

178
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,324
然而这些白眼狼却把他们的排名交给马赫什瓦里
..and the scoundrels will give their ranks to Maheshwari.

179
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,331
不用这么紧张，先生
You are tense without reason, sir.

180
00:09:34,853 --> 00:09:36,709
我跟他们谈过了，他们哪儿也不会去
I've spoken to them. They won't go anywhere.

181
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:39,709
巴特拉先生，在培训行业，这一年至关重要
Mr. Batla, in the coaching business it's all about one year only.

182
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:42,086
如果他们今年没有拿到排名，我们明年就得不到入学许可了
If they don't get a rank this year we won't get admissions next year.

183
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,978
我们还要把他的照片挂多久？
How long will we print his photo anyway?

184
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:45,949
他看起来好丑
He looks so ugly.

185
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,949
是的，先生，真丑
Yes, sir. That is true.

186
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,351
但是，先生，如果你找一个孩子们都尊重的人去跟他们谈
But, sir, when a respected man talks to the children..

187
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,091
-那他们一定会听的-确实
..theydefinitely pay heed to him. -Correct.

188
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:01,185
叫杰图先生和他们谈谈，他们会听话的
Call Jeetu sir to talk to them. They will pay heed to him.

189
00:10:04,491 --> 00:10:06,737
-他用了你的名字?-不仅如此
He took your name? - Not just my name.

190
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:09,229
他给了我这张卡片，上面有他的个人号码
He gave me this card with his personal number.

191
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:12,008
-他还给了我奖学金-给我看看
He even gave me scholarship. - Show me.

192
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,109
好好学习，否则你不会得到它
Work hard. You don't get it otherwise.

193
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,598
我打赌迪帕克看到这些尖子生要跳槽一定紧张的不行
I bet Deepak must have been sweating bullets seeing the toppers run.

194
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:21,609
是的，他对我们说话很有礼貌
Yes. He talked to us so politely...

195
00:10:21,782 --> 00:10:23,168
我爸爸都没跟我说话这么客气过
My dad never spoke to me so politely.

196
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,871
巴特拉是个感性的人
And Batla was so sentimental ..

197
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:28,025
他一定会升职的
He will surely get a promotion.

198
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:33,012
他说现在你在 A1，一切都会顺利的
He said now that you are in A1 now it will be smooth sailing.

199
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:36,592
我们误解了巴特拉
We have misunderstood Batla.

200
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,183
他甚至知道我的弱项
He even knows that I am weak at equilibrium.

201
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:41,742
他说会给我额外补课
He said I shall give you extra classes.

202
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:45,347
放弃马赫什瓦里，并留在神童的学生都赢得了尊重
Students who leave Maheshwari and remain with Prodigy gain respect.

203
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:48,398
我去年也放弃了马赫什瓦里，但是我没有得到任何回报
I too left Maheshwari last year but I didn't gain any.

204
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:51,995
我应该重新参加考试吗? 下一次考试是什么时候？
Shall I reappear for the exams? When is the next exam?

205
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,629
现在有什么好处，伙计？
What good will it do now, buddy?

206
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,480
优等生都已经考完了
The toppers already sat for the exam.

207
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,589
没错，反正他们也要开始新学期了
That's right. Their batches are going to begin anyway.

208
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:00,071
你可以明年参加
You can appear for it next year.

209
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:02,136
但是没有人会真的过去
But nobody is going to go.

210
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:05,799
为什么?-他们参加考试都只是为了了解竞争情况
Why? - All of them sat for the exam only to check out the competition.

211
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,260
我们那么努力才进入到A1组，为什么现在要走？
We worked so hard to get to A1. Why would they go now?

212
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,253
是的，没错
Yes, that is correct.

213
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:12,589
嘿！索梅什
Hey, Somesh.

214
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,049
舒巴姆，我们在一起学习已经一年了
Shubham, we have been studying together for the past one year.

215
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,114
你从没告诉过我你是比哈尔族人
You never told me you are a Bihari.

216
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,762
-不，我是来自格勒亨迪县的奥里亚族人 -我知道了
No, I am Oriya. From Kalahandi. - I see.

217
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:29,540
你的意思是你说话不像“我们正在做这件事”或“我们正在说那件事”
Do you mean you don't talk like "we are doing this" or "we are saying that?"

218
00:11:29,704 --> 00:11:30,173
不是的
No.

219
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,709
那你他妈的为什么在那里乱说话？
Then why the fuck were you using those words over there?

220
00:11:33,547 --> 00:11:34,949
我们之前就是这么定的呀
That's what we decided we would say.

221
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,422
你这头猪! 你应该说你不去的
You swine! You were supposed to say you aren't going.

222
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,436
但你说“我们” ，这不就说明我们已经串通好了吗？
If you say "We", won't he know we have formed a group?

223
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,732
天知道什么样的白痴会去马赫什瓦里
Lord knows what kind of idiots make it to Maheshwari.

224
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:44,949
甜点给我
Give me dessert.

225
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:50,824
下次有人问你，你就说你不去
Next time anyone asks you say you aren't going.

226
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,000
如果他问起其他人，你就说你不知道
If he asks about the others, you say you don't know.

227
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,509
我没跟任何人讨论过这件事
I haven't spoken to anyone about it.

228
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:56,968
否则他们所有人都会追着我们不放
Else all of them will hound us.

229
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:02,419
我觉得巴特拉的话很有道理
I felt what Batla said made sense.

230
00:12:02,928 --> 00:12:05,910
别听他的，他在胡说八道！
Don't listen to him. He was talking nonsense!

231
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:08,949
你的S块很差，那是因为他教得不好
You are weak at S block because he didn't teach it well.

232
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:12,789
巴特拉嫉妒我们，他自己都想去马赫什瓦里
Batla is jealous of us. He wants to go to Maheshwari himself..

233
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:15,997
但是马赫什瓦里不雇佣非印度理工毕业的教师
..but Maheshwari does not employ non-IITian teachers.

234
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:18,629
我们已经到了A1组，不是吗？
We have made it to A1 somehow, haven't we?

235
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:22,232
-这不是也挺好的-在这里任何白痴都能进A1组
We will deal with it. - Any idiot can make it to A1 over here.

236
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,319
你去马赫什瓦里考个A1我看看
Try getting into the A1 batch at Maheshwari.

237
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,149
它被称为最好的学院不是没有道理的
It is not known as the best institute without reason.

238
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,829
这里的人JEE都考不好
These people cannot handle JEE.

239
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,349
而那边的学生正在一个接一个地破解奥林匹克竞赛题
Their students are cracking one Olympiad after another.

240
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,904
以后也是一样，他们会跟你打感情牌
In future too they will lay it on thick with their emotional crap.

241
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:35,954
别理他，知道为什么吗？
Don't pay heed. You know why?

242
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:39,962
因为这里有的，马赫什瓦里也有
Because they have several things at Maheshwari that are missing here..

243
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:44,008
因为这里没有的，马赫什瓦里也都有
..but they don't have anything over here that is missing at Maheshwari.

244
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,549
杰图·拜亚？
Jeetu Bhaiya?

245
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,691
我不去，拜亚哥
I am not going, Bhaiya.

246
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:05,909
我已经开始学静电学了
I have already started electrostatics.

247
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:09,227
那你为什么还参加考试
Then why did you sit for the exam.

248
00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:10,218
没什么
No reason.

249
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,482
我想看看我到底什么水平
I wanted to see where I stand.

250
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:14,783
什么水平? 你到 A1了吗？
Did you see? Did you make it to A1?

251
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,172
我在 A3，但是我不去了，拜亚哥
I made it to A3. But I am not going, Bhaiya.

252
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:21,829
舒伯汉，你的朋友到底去不去？
Shubham, is your friend going or not?

253
00:13:22,246 --> 00:13:25,401
拜亚哥，我不去，我也不知道他去不去
Bhaiya, I am not going. I don't know about him..

254
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:28,909
因为我们还没讨论过，我只能告诉你我的计划
..because we haven't discussed it. I can only tell you of my plans.

255
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:30,598
- 你们还没讨论过?-没有
You haven't discussed it? - No.

256
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,909
你们是朋友，朋友之间应该讨论一下的
You are friends. Friends should discuss things.

257
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:36,589
我们不是朋友，他都不知道我是奥里亚族
We aren't friends, Bhaiya. He doesn't even know I am Oriya.

258
00:13:36,945 --> 00:13:39,599
- 你来自格勒亨迪县，对吗?-是的，但我不去
From Kalahandi, right? - Yes. But I am not going.

259
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:41,490
没错，拜亚哥，我们也不去了
That's right, Bhaiya. Even we are not going.

260
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,055
好吧，那就没什么好说的了
Well, alright. There's no point then.

261
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,229
你们都走吧
All of you go. Chill.

262
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:03,457
拜亚哥
Bhaiya.

263
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:04,519
拜亚哥
Bhaiya.

264
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:09,028
我听到他们在餐厅里聊天了
I heard both Shubham and Alok talking in the mess.

265
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:10,709
他们两个都要去马赫什瓦里
Both of them are going to Maheshwari.

266
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:15,130
我可以给你书面保证-我知道，这种事每年都会发生
I'd give you that in writing. - I know. It happens every year.

267
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,026
我也知道你不会去，但事实上你应该去
I also know that you aren't going, when in fact you should go.

268
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:22,459
每年我们这里都有像你这样的人
Every year we even have someone like you over here.

269
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,709
别说笑了，拜亚哥
Please stop ragging me, Bhaiya.

270
00:14:26,238 --> 00:14:28,068
我是因为瓦蒂卡才去考试的
I only sat for the exam because Vartika..

271
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,211
我以后再跟你解释，但是我不想去
I'll tell you later. But I don't want to go.

272
00:14:34,971 --> 00:14:36,221
你去考试是件好事
You did a good thing by sitting for it.

273
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,829
既然你已经通过了，那你就应该去
Now that you have been selected you should go.

274
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:40,333
你可以好好学学物理学
Look, you can manage physics.

275
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:42,346
你的化学和数学都有待提高
You have a problem with chemistry and Math.

276
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:44,307
既然你已经放弃了化学
Now that you are giving up inorganic..

277
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:46,487
那就要加强数学和物理，不是吗？
..you have to strengthen organic and physical, right?

278
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:47,829
那边的老师教得更好
It is taught well over there.

279
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,829
但是我现在已经在这里稳定下来了
But I am settled over here now, Bhaiya.

280
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:55,829
一切都很顺利
Everything is going well.

281
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:57,829
我为什么要现在离开？
Why would I leave now?

282
00:14:58,185 --> 00:14:59,829
如果你不去，你要怎么提升自己? 
How will you grow if you don't go? Tell me.

283
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,552
俗话说得好，如果你是班上最聪明的人
You know the saying, if you're the smartest person in the class..

284
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,829
那你就进错班了
..you're in the wrong class.

285
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,154
你在这里和谁竞争？
With whom will you compete over here?

286
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,654
你所有的竞争对手都离开了
All your competition will leave.

287
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,387
舒伯汉姆和阿洛克，你们组的人都会离开的
Your batches, Shubham and Alok. All of them will leave.

288
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,829
与其在这里得意洋洋地呆在 A1
Rather than getting complacent in A1 over here..

289
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,610
还不如在那边的A3挣扎
..you'll be better off struggling in A3 over there.

290
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:17,300
考到那边的 A1去
Make your way to A1 over there.

291
00:15:20,951 --> 00:15:22,664
但是你在这里，拜亚哥
But you are over here, Bhaiya.

292
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:25,829
你一次能爱上多少人？
How many people are you going to fall in love with at one time?

293
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:27,785
你不明白
You don't understand.

294
00:15:28,472 --> 00:15:30,644
如果你想成长，你必须继续前进
You must continue to move if you wish to grow.

295
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,605
如果你想听我的讲座，我每周都会上传非学院的课程
If you want my lecture I give them on Unacademy plus every week.

296
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,829
你看重播就好了
Watch the live lecture on it.

297
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:38,612
鱼和熊掌不可兼得
One has to give up on some things.

298
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,781
没理由后悔
There's no reason to be remorseful.

299
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:41,829
我明白了
I see.

300
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:45,324
如果你的学生离开，你不会有挫败感吗
Won't you be hurt if one of your students leaves..

301
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:48,117
去另一个学院？
..to go to another Institute?

302
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,742
如果他不去，最后没考上，我会更伤心
I will be hurt more if he doesn't go and he's not selected.

303
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,637
我们帮助你提高了一些，他们会让你更上一层楼
We fixed some of your weaknesses and they will fix some.

304
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:02,242
对，你曾经说过，我不是一个人，我不应该紧张
Right. You told me I am not alone. I should not be nervous.

305
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,511
我们将一起攻克难关
We will crack IIT.

306
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:05,829
我们会一起战斗到最后一刻
We will fight together right up to the last minute.

307
00:16:06,296 --> 00:16:07,829
我是在战斗啊
I am fighting.

308
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,496
你的选择很重要
Your selection is important.

309
00:16:10,576 --> 00:16:12,715
你在哪里考上并不重要
Where you are selected from was never important.

310
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,520
怎么了？
What's the matter?

311
00:16:30,601 --> 00:16:32,704
拜亚哥，从我来这儿的第一天起
Bhaiya, from the first day that I arrived here..

312
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:37,165
我一直希望我的照片能挂在墙上
..it had been my wish to have my photo put up over here.

313
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:40,815
-他们也会把你的照片贴出来-不是那边
So, they will put up your photo. - Not over there.

314
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,829
在这里... 你所在的地方
Over here... The place where you are at.

315
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:49,132
听着，阿琼跟因陀罗学习，他也跟湿婆学习
Look, Arjun learned from Indra. He learned from Shiva too.

316
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,627
但他仍然被称为德罗纳的学生，不是吗？
Still he was known as Dronacharya's student, wasn't he?

317
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,387
难道我不应该在名字前面加上我以前的姓吗？
Don't I put ex-Agarwalite in front of my name?

318
00:16:55,518 --> 00:16:56,829
如果我是你，我会去的
If I were in your shoes I would go.

319
00:16:58,744 --> 00:17:00,787
因为他们能让你提升更多
Because we don't have anything here that they don't have over there.

320
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:14,135
你和瓦伊巴夫谈过了吗？
Have you spoken to Vaibhav?

321
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,789
没有，我给他打了电话，但没接通
No. I called him but I didn't get through.

322
00:17:17,147 --> 00:17:19,531
我猜他一定在自习室，他会打电话来的
He must be at the Institute, I guess. He will call.

323
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,490
我和乌代谈过了
I spoke to Uday.

324
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,388
瓦伊巴夫的教导主任找他谈话了
Vaibhav's admin had summoned him..

325
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:30,808
还有其他要去马赫什瓦里的孩子一起
..along with the other kids who are going to Maheshwari.

326
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,254
他要去吗?-不
He is going? - No.

327
00:17:35,277 --> 00:17:37,764
我明白了，所以你才问我有没有跟他谈过
I see. That's why you asked me if I'd spoken to him.

328
00:17:37,882 --> 00:17:38,795
交叉核对？
To cross check?

329
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,869
听着，如果你叫他不要去，他一定不会去的
Listen. He won't go if you tell him not to go.

330
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:44,747
我为什么不让他去? 如果我是他的话，我会不去吗？
Why should I tell him? Wouldn't I go if I were in his shoes?

331
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,559
这不就是我们参加考试的初衷吗？
Wasn't that the reason we took the exam?

332
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,040
你完全没有准备，他也没有
For which you were not at all prepared and neither was he.

333
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:51,510
他甚至都不想参加考试
He didn't even want to sit for the exam.

334
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,569
然而整整一个星期，他把一切事情都放下了
Yet all week long he set everything aside..

335
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,229
来帮助你准备考试，对吗？
..to help you prepare for the exam, right?

336
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,737
他本可以回家的，不是吗? 然而他没有回家
He could've gone home, couldn't he? He did not go.

337
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:03,273
因为他喜欢你，瓦蒂卡
Because he likes you, Vartika.

338
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,667
他喜欢你
He likes you.

339
00:18:08,076 --> 00:18:09,720
如果你不想说，那就让我和他谈吧？
Do you want me to talk to him if you can't talk?

340
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:10,769
不要
Oh, no.

341
00:18:11,571 --> 00:18:14,172
听着，如果他去马赫什瓦里不是对他有好处吗？
Look, won't it be good for him if he goes to Maheshwari?

342
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,525
-那边什么都有-没有你
They have everything over there. - You aren't.

343
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,635
我这么说不是为了你们的情爱浪漫
Look, I'm not saying this for the sake of your lovey-dovey romance.

344
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,642
我一点也不在乎那个
I couldn't give two hoots about that.

345
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:26,817
你们俩设定了一个目标
You two had set a goal that you were following.

346
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:31,349
他自学的效率绝对没有你们一起学习的效率高
By himself he would never study as much as he studies with you.

347
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,508
你在一个星期内完成了11年级的全部教学大纲
You completed the entire syllabus of the 11th grade in one week..

348
00:18:36,771 --> 00:18:38,306
你甚至都开始学习12年级的课程
..and you even started studying for 12th grade.

349
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:42,307
你以前有没有提前学习过教学大纲? 没有
Did you ever get ahead of the class syllabus before? No.

350
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,498
你并不是你们俩中唯一受益的人
You aren't the only one who will benefit by being together..

351
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:48,509
他也会从中受益
..he will also benefit.

352
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:51,794
他知道的，唯一的问题在于他不会告诉你
He knows this. The only problem is that he won't tell you.

353
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:53,096
那么，你应该告诉他
So, you tell him.

354
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,509
你去帮他，别让他一个人等着
You help him. Don't leave him hanging.

355
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,349
如果你有什么问题，他会来帮助你的，不是吗？
He will come to help you if you ever have a problem, won't he?

356
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,674
拜亚哥说的不对！
Jeetu bhaiya is wrong. Tell me.

357
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:11,254
你告诉我，他们那边有什么？
You tell me. What do they have over there?

358
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:13,725
他们那边A3组有80%能考上
80 percent of the A3 batch from Maheshwariis selected, right?

359
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,704
还有20%考不上，拜亚哥没有告诉你吗？
20 percent does not get selected. Jeetu Bhaiya didn't tell you that.

360
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:19,243
你不按时起床上课，每天我都来叫醒你
You don't wake up on time for classes. I wake you up.

361
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,756
你一个人在那边怎么办？
How will you prepare on your own over there?

362
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,451
拜亚哥没有告诉你，你们讨论过这个吗？
Jeetu Bhaiya didn't tell you that. Did you discuss this?

363
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,039
我们没有聊那么细
He was only discussing with me.

364
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,518
再说我们会保持联系的
Besides, we will stay in touch, Meena.

365
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:28,598
你为什么这么说？
Why are you saying such things?

366
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,269
真的? 你见过皮尤什吗？
Really? Do you meet Piyush?

367
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:32,178
他是你学校的朋友，不是吗？
He was your school friend, wasn't he?

368
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:34,025
告诉我这几个月你有去看过他吗？
Tell me how many times you went to see him in all these months.

369
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,949
一旦你去了那里，你就没有时间联系我了
Once you go there you won't have the time.

370
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,827
还有，你欠我七个泡芙
Also, you owe me seven puffs.

371
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:40,746
你不给我就不能走
You can't leave until you give it to me.

372
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:41,863
就这么定了，你不能走
That is final. That is final.

373
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,309
我还在思考这个问题
I am still pondering over it.

374
00:19:44,571 --> 00:19:45,309
我还不知道
I don't know as yet.

375
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,597
迪帕克说一套，拜亚哥又说一套
Deepak is saying something. Bhaiya is saying something else.

376
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:52,749
-我不知道我该怎么办-看到了吗？
I don't know what I should do. - You see?

377
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:53,717
看到了吗? 看到了吗？
You see? You see?

378
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:55,476
我才是那个给你指点迷津的人
I am the one who explains everything to you.

379
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:57,142
没有我，你就没办法理解
Without me you cannot make sense of things.

380
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,258
你跟他说说，乌代，我也去跟他说
You talk to him, Uday. I'll talk to him too.

381
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,946
你不能去，好吗？
You are not going. Okay?

382
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,459
你告诉他，乌代
You tell him, Uday.

383
00:20:05,243 --> 00:20:07,470
-我能说什么呢?-告诉他不要去
What can I say? - Tell him not to go.

384
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:12,827
你我说什么对他来说都不重要
What you or I say shouldn't matter to him.

385
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:15,880
他来这里的目的是考上印度理工学院
He came here to prepare for IIT.

386
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:17,985
不是吗？
Didn't you?

387
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:19,755
所以，你去吧
So, do that.

388
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:25,970
我想现在我们觉得来到了科塔，我们玩得很开心
I guess right now we feel we have come to Kota, we are having fun..

389
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,886
我们一起学习
..we are going out, studying,

390
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,087
创造美好的回忆
memories are being created..

391
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,428
并且建立友谊
..and forming friendships..

392
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:36,708
但是如果我们在这一切结束时，得不到想要的结果
..but if we don't get the desired result at the end of all this..

393
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:40,421
那样我们就不会回想起这些时光了
..then we won't feel like turning around and remembering these times.

394
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,159
那么它就会作为不好的记忆，留在我们的脑海里
Then it stays with us as a bad memory.

395
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:53,789
如果没考上，那些被我们浪费掉的时间就会一直困扰着我们
If we aren't selected then all our mischief will haunt us as mistakes.

396
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:57,989
我们都是同龄人
We are at such an age.

397
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,989
无法预见未来
We are unable to foresee the future.

398
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:05,966
你还在犹豫，是吗？
You are in doubt, aren't you?

399
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,401
-和你爸爸谈谈-就好像你很听你爸的话一样
Talk to your dad. - As though you pay heed to your dad.

400
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:14,341
我不能听从他的指示
I am unable to follow his instructions.

401
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:17,252
这并不意味着我无视他的看法
It does not mean that I don't pay heed to him.

402
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,221
我做不到
I can't do it.

403
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:25,558
我无法集中注意力，我不能像你们这样坐6个小时
I am unable to concentrate. I cannot sit up 6 hours like you guys.

404
00:21:25,829 --> 00:21:26,558
我该怎么办？
What should I do?

405
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:27,949
你告诉我，米纳，我该怎么办？
You tell me, Meena. What should I do?

406
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,949
告诉我，我是应该跳楼还是上吊，或者直接离家出走
Tell me. Shall I leap to death, hang or run away?

407
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:32,949
我回不去了
I can't even return.

408
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,493
人们会问我发生了什么
People will ask me what happened.

409
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:37,318
你想考印度理工学院，但是没考上？
You wanted to join IIT. You didn't get selected into IIT?

410
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,827
我看着你的时候觉得很惭愧，米纳
I feel ashamed of myself when I look at you, Meena.

411
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,428
尽管你家境不好，我还是为你的成就而感到羞愧
I feel ashamed of your achievements despite your background.

412
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:46,429
我什么都有了
I have everything.

413
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:49,353
尽管拥有了一切，但我却一事无成
Despite having everything I failed to achieve anything.

414
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:50,959
我什么也做不了
I am unable to do anything.

415
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:53,782
我父亲是国税局官员
My father is an IRS Officer.

416
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,037
我该怎么跟他说我是废物？
How do I tell him I am worthless?

417
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,767
我考不上印度理工学院
I won't be able to crack the IIT exams.

418
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:00,053
请原谅我！
Please pardon me!

419
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:01,429
我该怎么告诉他，米纳？
How do I tell him, Meena?

420
00:22:11,862 --> 00:22:12,589
和你爸爸谈谈
Talk to your dad.

421
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:15,972
他叫你做什么你就做什么
Do what he tells you to do.

422
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:20,258
你父母的决定可能是错误的
Your parents' decision could be wrong..

423
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,206
但他们的意图绝不会错
..but their intent is never wrong.

424
00:22:56,554 --> 00:22:58,789
我们要把这个物体从位置 a 带到位置 b
We have to take this object from location A to location B.

425
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,469
对不对？
Correct?

426
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:03,589
它不会仅仅靠吹气就到那里去
It won't go there just by blowing.

427
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:04,589
它需要被推动
It needs to be pushed.

428
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:07,165
这个物体需要一个推力，就像每个人都需要一个推力
This object needs a push like every person needs a push.

429
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:10,803
所以我们要对它施加力量
So we shall apply force toit.

430
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:16,366
我们只施加足够的力把它推到中性点
We only apply enough force to push it to the neutral point.

431
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:20,768
它自身的潜力将带领它走完剩下的路程
Its own potential will take it the rest of the way.

432
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,868
对吗? 关于这个问题我已经告诉你很多了
Correct? I've told you a lot about this problem.

433
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:28,632
你来解决剩下的问题，然后下节课我们再来讨论
You solve the rest of it and bring it back to the next class.

434
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:29,989
我们下次什么时候见面？
When will we be meeting next?

435
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:32,989
我们什么时候见面? 星期四，所以，你有两天时间
When will we meet? On Thursday. So, you have two days.

436
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:37,572
在那之前，先解决问题
Until then, solve the problem.

437
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:41,041
坐，坐，怎么了？
Sit. Sit. What is the matter?

438
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,568
你决定了吗？
Have you decided?

439
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:52,622
这是给你的
This is for you.

440
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:54,654
给我的？
For me?

441
00:23:55,903 --> 00:23:59,069
谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you for everything.

442
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:03,897
哇，大手笔！
Oh big spender!

443
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,874
如果你在我身上花了这么多钱，那个考试的女孩叫什么名字？
If you are spending so much on me, what is the name of the exam girl?

444
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:08,798
你一定花了不少钱在瓦妮莎身上
You must have really splurged on the Vernali.

445
00:24:09,285 --> 00:24:11,811
瓦蒂卡-你同时勾引两个女孩？
Vartika. - You are hitting on two girls simultaneously?

446
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,429
别闹了，拜亚哥
Just drop it, Bhaiya.

447
00:24:20,236 --> 00:24:21,182
来，我给你看样东西
Come. I'll show you something.

448
00:24:22,373 --> 00:24:23,043
过来，过来
Come. Come.

449
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:26,172
这边
Over here.

450
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,415
你进来怎么不脱鞋，算了，进来吧
You will take off your shoes..? leave it just come in.

451
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,833
你看到这些了吗？
Do you see these?

452
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:48,503
这是阿玛尼的
This is Armani.

453
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:50,949
这是古驰的
This is Gucci.

454
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:53,636
我觉得这个在印度都买不到
I think this one isn't even available in India.

455
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:55,796
看到那双鞋了吗？
You see those shoes?

456
00:24:57,211 --> 00:24:57,949
LV的
All of them are LV.

457
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:02,389
这些手表，雷多，劳力士
These watches. Rado. Rolex.

458
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:04,219
沙鲁克为这个做的广告
Shahrukh does the ad for this one.

459
00:25:05,224 --> 00:25:06,897
我一直想搞清楚这句法语是什么意思
I wonder what's written here in French.

460
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,327
你为什么要炫耀这些，拜亚哥？
Why are you showing off, Bhaiya?

461
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,389
我必须炫耀，这些都是我学生送的礼物
I have to. These are gifts from my students.

462
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,731
这才是我真正的收入
This is my true earning.

463
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:17,778
我从不穿这些，但我穿起来最好看
I don't wear them but I look best in them.

464
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:23,178
来自印度理工学院孟买分校的沙布哈姆，然后去了麻省理工学院
Shubham from IIT Bombay. Then MIT.

465
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:27,509
这是印度理工的阿卡什送的，后来他辍学
This is from Akash. IIT Kanpur. CS dropout.

466
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,165
去了微软
Then Microsoft.

467
00:25:29,425 --> 00:25:31,543
他现在有一家创业公司，天知道他以后还会做什么
He has a startup now. Lord knows what he's going to do.

468
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:32,869
那是奇拉格送的
That's from Chirag.

469
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:34,541
这是来自詹维的
This is from Jhanvi.

470
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,422
他们和你一样，都给我送了礼物
Like you, all of them had brought gifts for me.

471
00:25:39,677 --> 00:25:40,491
我都没有接受
I didn't accept.

472
00:25:41,327 --> 00:25:43,549
我不反对礼物，我接受礼物
Nothing against gifts. I do accept gifts..

473
00:25:44,022 --> 00:25:44,957
只要是用你自己的收入买来的就行
..as long as they're bought with your earning..

474
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,549
用你父亲的收入可不算
..not with your father's earning.

475
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,158
努力学习，完成你的学业
Work hard. Complete your studies.

476
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:51,842
在你成功之后
And after you become successful..

477
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:56,309
如果你还记得有人叫杰图·拜亚或杰图先生
..if you still remember anyone called Jeetu Bhaiya or Jeetu sir..

478
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:58,235
那时候你再来给我送一份礼物，我就会接受它
..then you bring me a gift. Then I shall accept it.

479
00:25:59,235 --> 00:26:00,757
我不接受这么便宜的东西
And I don't accept such cheap stuff.

480
00:26:01,586 --> 00:26:02,109
你留着吧
Keep it.

481
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:06,109
好好保管，好好利用它
Take care of it. Make good use of it..

482
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:08,523
然后去马赫什瓦里
..and go to Maheshwari.

483
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:11,158
好吗？
Okay?

484
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,854
是或不是，说点什么，兄弟
Yes or no. Say something, bro.

485
00:26:15,969 --> 00:26:16,852
去吧
Go.

486
00:26:29,776 --> 00:26:31,235
瓦蒂卡没来吗？
Didn't Vartika come?

487
00:26:32,514 --> 00:26:33,740
你没有打电话叫她来吗？
Did you call and ask her to come?

488
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:37,469
姐妹
Man.

489
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,878
我没法给她打电话
I couldn't get myself to call her.

490
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:46,189
你能帮我做件事吗? 你能把这些笔记给她吗？
Will you do something for me? Will you please give her these notes?

491
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:47,061
为什么？
Why?

492
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:48,379
你不能给她吗？
Can't you give them to her?

493
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,229
天知道我什么时候能见到她-不关我的事
Lord knows when I'll see her. - Not my problem.

494
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,158
你自己给她吧
Give them to her yourself.

495
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,549
还有东西吗?-没有了
Any more bags? - No.

496
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:04,314
保重
Well, take care.

497
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,022
保持联系
Stay in touch.

498
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:14,731
我把延长线放在你的包里了
I put the extension cord in your bag.

499
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,312
他要价150卢比，别给他超过100卢比
He is demanding 150 rupees. Don't give him more than 100.

500
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:20,385
米纳
Meena.

501
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:29,418
七个洋葱泡芙
Seven onion puffs.

502
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:31,419
我欠你的，不是吗？
I owed you, didn't I?

503
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:33,367
我在离开之前要清算一下比分
I am clearing the score before leaving.

504
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,035
-拿着-不，你留着吧
Take it. - No, no. You keep it.

505
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,669
等你到了那边食堂就关门了，吃这个吧
The mess won't be open when you get there. Eat this.

506
00:27:42,187 --> 00:27:43,549
你拒绝吃洋葱泡芙？
You are refusing onion puffs?

507
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:45,520
我不会放过你的
I am not letting you off the hook.

508
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,549
我在印度理工等你
Meet me at IIT.

509
00:27:47,894 --> 00:27:50,870
到那里再清算
Repay me there.

510
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,992
那边没有卖这个的，所以你得付很高的利息
This won't be available over there, so, you'll have to pay heavy interest.

511
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:56,170
你得用羊角面包付账-我明白了
You'll have to pay with croissants. - I see.

512
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:00,355
到时候我会在理工学院帮你解题
When I solve your doubts in IIT..

513
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:02,666
你得付我双倍的羊角面包
..you will have to pay me with double the number of croissants.

514
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,493
明白了吗?-你能帮我解题吗？
Get it? - You will solve my doubts?

515
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:10,149
走着瞧-走着瞧
We shall see. - We shall see.

516
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:12,520
你想赌一把吗?-赌一把
You wanna bet on it? - It's a bet.

517
00:28:23,112 --> 00:28:24,918
-我们保持联系-不不
We shall stay in touch. - No, no.

518
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,709
你好好学习，不要去想这些
You study. Don't think about it.

519
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,429
无论如何，住在一起和偶尔见面
In any case, there's a difference between meeting sometimes..

520
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:33,280
还是有区别的
..and living together.

521
00:28:34,691 --> 00:28:37,806
说到底，在这条路上，友谊不是必须的
Anyway friendship is not revision that must be done.

522
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:40,941
专注于你的学业
Focus on your studies.

523
00:28:42,363 --> 00:28:43,429
再见
Bye.

524
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:00,673
再见，兄弟
See you, bro.

525
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:04,869
再见
Bye.

526
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:07,869
请代我向瓦蒂卡说再见
Please say bye to Vartika for me.

527
00:29:11,804 --> 00:29:12,869
双层羊角面包
Double croissants.

528
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:34,756
瓦伊巴夫！
Vaibhav!

529
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:38,327
等我一下，兄弟
Stop for a minute, brother.

530
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,826
怎么了? 没事吧？
What's the matter? Is everything okay?

531
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:50,777
没事，我一路跑过来的
Yes, I ran over.

532
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,656
这就是为什么……-哦
That's why.. - Oh.

533
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:06,349
我以为你明天早上才走
I thought you were leaving tomorrow morning.

534
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:12,321
是的，实际上新来的租客让我今天把房间空出来，所以……
Yes. Actually the new PG told me to shift today, so..

535
00:30:12,756 --> 00:30:14,000
哦
Oh.

536
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,666
对不起
Sorry.

537
00:30:21,296 --> 00:30:22,926
我应该给你打电话的
I should have called you.

538
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:38,066
我没想到你会离开
I didn't think you would leave.

539
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,683
我们很合得来
We clicked well.

540
00:30:43,878 --> 00:30:46,096
- 我们一起学习-是的
With our studies. - Yes.

541
00:30:46,938 --> 00:30:48,102
我是说……
I mean..

542
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,026
其实我也没想到我会去
Actually even I did not think I would go..

543
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,645
但我必须要去了
..but I have to go.

544
00:30:59,611 --> 00:31:00,126
好吧
Yes.

545
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:18,751
这是给你的
This is for you.

546
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,124
这对你会有所帮助
It will be useful to you.

547
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:22,793
谢谢你
Thank you.

548
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,349
你冷吗？
Are you cold?

549
00:31:37,992 --> 00:31:40,060
不冷，怎么了？
No. Why? What happened?

550
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,947
你在发抖，所以我才问的
You are shivering. That's why I asked.

551
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,320
是的
Yes.

552
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:45,958
我不知道，也许吧
I don't know. Maybe.

553
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:50,696
我想这是因为我有点紧张
I guess it is happening because I am a little nervous.

554
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:52,818
哦！
Oh!

555
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,349
等等，拿着这个
Wait a minute. Hold this.

556
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:59,349
-干嘛?-拿着
What's the matter? - Hold it.

557
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:28,140
张嘴
Have this.

558
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,351
谢谢
Thanks.

559
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,952
剩下的酸奶怎么办？
What will you do with the rest of the yogurt?

560
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:42,989
别担心，我会把它涂在头发上
Don't worry. I'll apply it on my hair.

561
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,189
恶心死了！
Gross! Yuck!

562
00:33:03,971 --> 00:33:06,305
祝你顺利考上理工学院
Best of luck for IIT.

563
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:10,509
为了理工学院

00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:15,259
再见
See you.

565
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:17,389
会再见的
You will.

566
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:35,033
我是瓦伊巴夫
'This is Vaibhav.'

567
00:33:36,295 --> 00:33:37,424
“是的”
'Yes.'

568
00:33:37,504 --> 00:33:39,417
这是我的科塔好吗，存一下吧
'This is my Kota number. Save it.'

569
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:43,368
“不，不是在马赫什瓦里，我在神童”
'No, not in Maheshwari. Prodigy.'

570
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:46,211
“我是米纳，神童A5组”
'I am Meena. Prodigy. A5.'

571
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,190
你为什么不早点来科塔
'Why didn't you come to Kota earlier?'

572
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,589
“我们本可以早点成为朋友”
'We would have become friends earlier.'

573
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:53,140
你好，瓦伊巴夫，你来自伊塔尔西，来到了神童
'Hi. Vaibhav. You're from Itarsi. You have come to Prodigy.'

574
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:54,589
“你就像阿姨的儿子，对吧? ”
'You are like a son to aunty, right?'

575
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:57,589
像你这样一个脆弱无助的孩子
'What is the reason a fragile and helpless boy like you..

576
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,943
在学期中途离开家，抛弃一切来到了科塔
..left his home, school and all else mid semester to come to Kota?'

577
00:34:01,529 --> 00:34:03,901
’你迟到了，所以有些落后
'You are lagging behind because you are late..

578
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:05,589
但你并不孤单
..but you aren't alone.'

579
00:34:06,504 --> 00:34:09,554
“我们将战斗到最后一刻，考上理工学院”
'We will fight right up to the last minute and crack IIT.'

580
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:11,121
是的
'Yes!'

581
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:06,509
你有火柴吗？
Do you have a match box?

582
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:10,297
不，不是为了点烟
No. Not to light a cigarette.

583
00:37:10,615 --> 00:37:12,629
我想点蚊香
I want to light a mosquito coil.

584
00:37:13,001 --> 00:37:13,909
这里有很多蚊子
There are many mosquitoes here.

585
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:18,701
应该有，我找找看
Yes, I might have one. Let me see.

586
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,478
我可以进来吗？
May I come in?

587
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:27,821
我是苏什塔，马赫什瓦里，A7组
I am Sushrut. Maheshwari classes. A7.

588

589
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:33,406
你呢？
You?

590
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:36,937
瓦伊巴夫，马赫什瓦里，A3组
Vaibhav. Maheshwari. A3.

591
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:43,848
那么，这是你的第一年还是你以前参加过培训班？
So, is this your first year or did you attend coaching before?

592
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:46,769
我11年级的时候在神童教育
I was in Prodigy in the 11th grade.

593
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:50,176
-塔尔万迪-哦！
Talwandi. - Oh.

594
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:53,429
那你一定是个书呆子
Then you must be quite a bookworm.

595
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,471
也不是，我每天也就五六个小时是书呆子
No. The usual five to six hours types.

596
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:05,537
我才刚来
I have only just come.

597
00:38:06,207 --> 00:38:10,277
每个人都使我大吃一惊
Seeing everyone has shaken me up.

598
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,908
我真希望我是来上11年级的
I wish I had come for the 11th grade.

599
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:17,393
我觉得12年级有点来不及了
I think 12th grade is a little late.

600
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,064
今年我也要寄宿在这里
I have my boards too this year.

601
00:38:21,187 --> 00:38:22,505
完全不知道该怎么办
I wonder how I will manage.

602
00:38:25,891 --> 00:38:26,629
不要紧张
Don't be tense.

603
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:29,421
只需21天
Only 21 days.

604
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,520
你只需要勤奋学习21天
You just have to slog for 21 days.

605
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,629
之后你就会习惯了
After that you will blend in.

606
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:40,501
要来点泡芙吗？
You want some puffs?
