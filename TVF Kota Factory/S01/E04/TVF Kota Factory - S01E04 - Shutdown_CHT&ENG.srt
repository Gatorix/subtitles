1
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:06,787
記一下你們的假期作業
All of you, write down the homework you have to do.

2
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:13,146
課後習題第32至38題
Problem number 32 to 38 on the sheet.

3
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,149
然後呢?-然後？
And? - And?

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,869
-就這些-就這？
And that's it. - That's it?

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,869
拜亞哥，我們有五天的假期
Bhaiya we have five days off.

6
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,429
再加點作業吧，我們能做完的
Give us some more. We will do it.

7
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,060
是的，我知道，所以不再加了
Yes, I know. That's why I am not giving you more.

8
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,032
這五天是學校的實踐日
These five days are for the school's practical.

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,156
你們都好好放鬆一下，好嗎？
All of you will focus on that and relax. Okay?

10
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,149
放鬆？
Relax?

11
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,909
是的，改組考試將在假期結束後的第15天進行
Yes. And your reshuffling exams will be held in 15 days of returning.

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,629
13天，拜亞哥-對，13天
13 days, sir. 13 days. - Listen. 13 days.

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,599
到時候你們再像個瘋子一樣學習
Then you have to study like a lunatic then.

14
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,149
是時候給你們的電池充充電了
Charge your battery a little.

15
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,629
好好放鬆一下，緩解壓力
You won't burn out if you relax a little along with your studies.

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,629
但是你們所有人都要把註意力放在學校上
But all of you will focus on school.

17
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,949
烏代，你在想什麼?-冇什麼
Uday, what's on your mind? - Sir.

18
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,716
這並不意味著你們就可以懶散了
That doesn't mean all of you laze completely. Just sleeping.

19
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:55,933
冷靜一點
Chill a little.

20
00:00:58,263 --> 00:00:59,777
你們中有多少人明天一早要去上學？
How many of you will be going to school for the first tomorrow?

21
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:00,725
舉起手來
Put your hands up.

22
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,309
太棒了! 你們都是未來的國家棟梁
Bravo! This is the cream of our country.

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,259
非常好！
Very good!

24
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,189
字寫得真好！
Superb handwriting!

25
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:38,925
實驗報告是用草書寫的
The lab report is written in cursive.

26
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,403
物有所值
Value for money.

27
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:46,594
他們給出的 g 值是8.2，不應該是9.8嗎？
They have given 8.2 as the value for g. Shouldn't it be 9.8?

28
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:47,749
無知的家夥！
Ignorant chap!

29
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,749
如果你在實驗室裏得到9.8作為 g 的值...-是的
If you get 9.8 as the value of g in the lab.. - Yes.

30
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,396
那你肯定是作弊了，兄弟
Then you have certainly cheated, bro.

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,749
8.2看起來更真實
8.2 seems more realistic.

32
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,122
即使是A1組的學生也會從他那裏買實驗報告
Even the A1 batch buys lab reports from him.

33
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,698
為了節省8個小時花了我700盧比
It cost me 700 rupees to save 8 hours.

34
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:06,149
300盧比，400盧比是為了租車
No. 300 rupees. 400 rupees was for the scooty rental.

35
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,223
你那破車我隻騎了兩天，這還要收我錢嗎？
Are you going to charge me just because I used your scooty for 2 days?

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,367
不不不，是我租的另一輛車
No, no. Not mine. The other one that I have rented.

37
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:17,284
4天隻要400盧比，是不是很劃算？
Only 400 rupees for 4 days. Isn't it great deal?

38
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,469
施萬吉說我做事冇有條理
Shivangi says I am not organized.

39
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,469
等著瞧吧
Wait and watch.

40
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,411
什麼另一輛？
What other one?

41
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,948
給誰租的? 花了我400盧比? ！
And for whom? It cost me 400 rupees?!

42
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,271
你想讓我們四個在一輛摩托車上疊羅漢嗎？
You expect the four of us to sit one on top of the other?

43
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,309
我太機智了，我已經在車裏加滿油
I am so sly. I've already filled petrol in the scooty.

44
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:36,469
- 什麼四個人?-你，我，施萬吉和瓦蒂卡
What four people? - You, me, Shivangi and Vartika.

45
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,029
哪個瓦蒂卡?-拉塔瓦爾
Vartika who? - Ratawal.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,829
- 拉塔瓦爾是誰?-希萬吉的朋友
Ratawal who? - Shivangi's friend.

47
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,825
你在說什麼，兄弟? 講清楚一點
What are you saying, bro? Quiet. Tell me calmly.

48
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,193
你在說什麼？
What are you saying?

49
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,749
我應該保持沈默還是告訴你？
Should I remain quiet or should I tell you?

50
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,049
聽著，我們有4天的休息時間
Look. We have a 4 day break.

51
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,465
冇有輔導，冇有家庭作業
No coaching. No homework.

52
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,081
我們一起去遊覽科塔
We will go on an excursion.

53
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,351
我另外租了一輛摩托車，這樣我們四個……
I rented a scooty so that the four of us..

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,560
你，我，施萬吉和她的朋友瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦爾可以好好逛一下科塔
..you, me, Shivangi and her friend Vartika Ratawal can sight see Kota.

55
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,035
是不是很酷？
Isn't that cool?

56
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,237
我哪兒也不去，我們有4天的休息時間
I am not going anywhere. We have a 4 day break.

57
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,056
瓦伊巴夫和我一起複習
Vaibhav and I will revise.

58
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,389
你要做什麼?-學習
What will you do? - Study.

59
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,389
不，不，別這麼做
No, no. Don't do it.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,853
拜亞哥說這幾天要放鬆，所以你應該放鬆
Jeetu Bhaiya said to relax, so you should relax.

61
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,003
哦，是的
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,989
你也會留意老師在課上說的每一句話嗎？
Do you also pay heed to everything the teachers say?

63
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,920
不然呢？
Is there another possibility?

64
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:39,115
你的思想如此純潔，就像我一樣
Your thoughts are so pure. Just like mine.

65
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,829
- 我不能去，兄弟 -去死吧！
I can't go, buddy. - Like hell!

66
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,530
我在車裏加了400盧比的汽油
I filled 400 rupees worth of petrol in the scooty.

67
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,829
還花了500盧比租車，現在你告訴我你不去了
I paid 500 rupees to rent it. Now you're telling me you won't go.

68
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,509
聽著，兄弟米納和我想複習一遍教學大綱
Look, bro. Meena and I want to complete the whole syllabus..

69
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:56,777
在這四天裏
..during these 4 days.

70
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,829
你總是這樣
You always do this, buddy.

71
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:01,589
十勝節就是被你這樣毀掉的
You ruined the Dussehra fair plans the same way.

72
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:02,661
等一下
One moment.

73
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,820
十勝節的時候我不在這裏
I wasn't here at the time of the Dussehra fair.

74
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,489
冇錯，你當時不在，現在也不在
Exactly. You weren't here then and you aren't now either.

75
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,682
兄弟，施萬吉最近一直躲著我
Bro. Shivangi has been avoiding me for a long time.

76
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,685
我不想她和我分手
I hope she doesn't break up with me.

77
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:25,663
她還冇準備好讓下一個男孩進入心房
She isn't even mean enough to wait for another boy to enter her life..

78
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,604
在她和我分手之前
..before she breaks up with me.

79
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,829
四天之內，我想去從三駕馬車到塔拉普的所有地方
Within four days I want to go everywhere from Troika to Talap..

80
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,390
七大奇跡之一,
..seven wonders to C V garden,

81
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,829
從羅陀 · 克裏希納到站立的甘尼什吉
from Radha Krishna to standing Ganeshji

82
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,829
那樣我們就能在科塔創造許多回憶
..so that we create so many memories here in Kota..

83
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,617
她就不會再想分手的事了
..even the thought of breaking up would torment her heart.

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,829
是不是很浪漫，兄弟
Basic romantic consumerism, buddy.

85
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,395
那就你們倆去好了
So, you go, bro.

86
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,152
為什麼讓我去做電燈泡？
Why are you making me the third wheel?

87
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,109
有些事冇有電燈泡是做不成的，兄弟
Some things can't be done without a third wheel, bro.

88
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:58,829
她不會一個人來的，大家都去她才會來
She will come if all of us go out. She won't come alone.

89
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,670
但是我們還要複習，兄弟
But our revision, bro.

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,829
是的，我就是這個意思
Yes, that's what I was saying. ??

91
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,451
-由於某些不可抗力，我們不能一起複習了-聽我說完……
Due to some unavoidable circumstances we won't be able to revise. - I am talking.

92
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:07,539
什麼? 什麼? 什麼？
What? What? What?

93
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,761
我們還要在4天內複習教學大綱
We have to complete the whole syllabus in 4 days.

94
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,214
我想放鬆，拜亞哥說的
I want to relax. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

95
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,828
帶我一起去吧，烏代
Take me with you, Uday.

96
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,829
你不會反悔吧? 答應我
You won't retract, will you? Promise me.

97
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,294
不會
No.

98
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,829
米納？
Meena?

99
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,736
我想我也該放鬆一下了
I think even I should go.

100
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,538
當然，跟我一起去吧
Of course. Come along.

101
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,209
- 對吧? 謝謝-明年
Right? Thank you. - Next year.

102
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:36,829
一起參加十勝節集市
For the Dussehra fair.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,069
你去吧，我要學習
You go. I shall study.

104
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,069
拿著這個，給你一個遊標卡尺
Take this. A Vernier caliper for you.

105
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,300
謝謝
Thanks.

106
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,439
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

107
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,585
你不是讓我放鬆嘛，我在放鬆
Exactly what you told me to do. Relax.

108
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,949
實驗進行得順利嗎?-非常順利，先生
Is the coaching going well? - Very good, sir.

109
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:27,949
一定是的
It must be.

110
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,422
你都冇有時間寫你自己的實驗報告
You don't have time to write your own lab report.

111
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,606
不是的，先生-我可以容忍 g 的最大值為7
No, sir. - I can tolerate the value of g up to 7.

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,269
但我不能容忍謊言
But I cannot tolerate lies.

113
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,803
你們這幫培訓班的學生不尊重學校
You coaching students don't respect school.

114
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,481
你是第一次來學校，是嗎?-不，先生
You have come to school for the first time, haven't you? - No, sir.

115
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,829
- 我來過-你又在撒謊
I came. - You're lying again.

116
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,560
冇有，先生，我來過好幾次
No, sir. I came several times.

117
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,429
在食堂吃泡芙要多少錢？
How much do puffs cost in the canteen?

118
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,909
你以為我是白癡嗎? 我看筆跡就知道
You think I am an idiot? I can tell by looking at the handwriting..

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,229
施樂中心的小夥子寫的
..the chap at the Xerox center has written it.

120
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,080
這是古普塔的筆跡
This is Gupta's handwriting.

121
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,308
你是從神童來的，是嗎?-是的，先生
You are from Prodigy, aren't you? - Yes, sir.

122
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,023
你不可能來自馬赫什瓦裏
You can't be from Maheshwari.

123
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,368
告訴迪帕克我想見他
Tell Deepak I wish to see him.

124
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,645
如果他明天不來
If he doesn't come to see me by tomorrow..

125
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,442
我就讓所有的神童學生都不及格
..I will fail all the Prodigy students.

126
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,116
然後你們繼續努力學習吧
Then you can keep trying for the JEE advance.

127
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,628
- 明白了嗎?-是的，先生
You understand? - Yes, sir.

128
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,909
下一個
Next.

129
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,727
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦爾
Vartika Ratawal.

130
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,679
米納，我和烏代一起去玩
Meena. I will go with Uday.

131
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,909
那我怎麼辦?-你在家裏放鬆
What about me relaxing? - You relax at home.

132
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,903
他們要去哪裏？
Where are they going?

133
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:11,318
去遊覽科塔
To sightsee all of Kota, inside out.

134
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,810
這真是個好計畫
That is such a nice plan.

135
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,149
瓦伊巴夫，你坐烏代的車，你坐我的
Vaibhav, you hop on Uday's vehicle and you come with me.

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,530
打擾了，朋友們，你們好
Excuse me. Hello, friends.

137
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,616
我能和你們一起去探索科塔嗎？
Can I go with all of you to explore Kota?

138
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,960
你是?-米娜爾·帕雷克
You are? - Meenal Parekh.

139
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,983
她是書呆子……咳咳……別帶她……咳咳
(fake coughs) Nerd Alert (fake coughs) Get rid of her.

140
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,588
- 你好-你好
Hello. - Hi.

141
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,703
非常歡迎你，但我們已經有四個人了
You're most welcome, but we are already four.

142
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,518
我們五個人坐不下的-六個
How can five of us go? - Six.

143
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,509
既然大家都要去，我也要去
Now that everyone is going I shall go too.

144
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,589
嗨，我是瓦伊巴夫-瓦蒂卡
Hi. I'm Vaibhav. - Vartika.

145
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,069
小施，還是你們一起去吧? 我們改天再聚
Shiv, why don't you all leave? I'll take a rain check.

146
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,989
我們在路上再買個墊子-不，不，我有
So we'll buy pads on the way. - No, no. I have some.

147
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,229
不不，這不是月經的問題
No. No. This is not about periods.

148
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,708
我收到了馬赫什瓦裏的入學試卷
I received Maheshwari's sample papers..

149
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,723
我一道題都不會做
..and I couldn't solve any of it.

150
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,469
所以，我應該留下來準備一下
So, I should stay back and prepare for it.

151
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,732
- 我為你製定了整個假期計劃-是的
I made the entire plan for you. - Yes.

152
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,278
- 現在你要拋棄我們?-對不起
You're ditching us? - Sorry.

153
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,324
哦! 和這些無聊的人在一起
Oh! With these boring people..

154
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,679
- 我會覺得無聊的-她在開玩笑
..I will get bored. - She's joking.

155
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,789
- 我們才不無聊-是的
We are not boring. - Yes, yes.

156
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,629
我們都是有趣的靈魂
We are very intelligent.

157
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:30,629
這些問題有三十分鍾肯定做完了-是的
These problems will be solved in 30 minutes. - Yes.

158
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:31,430
很簡單
Very easy.

159
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,033
- 是的，是的，我會幫她解決的
By them. - Yes, yes. I'll help her solve it.

160
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,109
別擔心，夥計們
No worries, guys.

161
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,509
- 施萬吉，求你了-不行，瓦蒂卡，你必須去
Shivangi, please. - No. Vartika, this is not done.

162
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:44,122
- 求你了-求你了，施萬吉，求你了
Please. - Please, Shivangi. Please.

163
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,216
好吧，繼續學習吧
Okay. Go ahead and study.

164
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,758
好的，那我也不去了
Well, alright. Then I won't go either.

165
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:55,634
為什麼？
Why?

166
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,669
你到底要改多少次主意？
How many times will you change your mind for one plan?

167
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,919
我們又不是去果阿
We aren't going to Goa.

168
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,684
我幫助她學習，這對她有幫助
I will help her study. It will be a help to her.

169
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:03,790
無論如何，你們四個人剛好
In any case you are a group of four.

170
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,069
米納也能幫她學習
She will study and get help. Meena will do it.

171
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,909
不，我要出去玩，拜亞哥說要放鬆
No, no. I shall go out. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

172
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,909
冇關係，烏代，這次我會做出犧牲的
It is okay, Uday. I shall make the sacrifice this time.

173
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,130
冇關係-不，不，瓦巴夫，你也來
It's fine. - No, no, Vaibhav. You come too.

174
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,989
如果你不放鬆的話，你會精疲力盡的來吧
You will burn out if you don't relax. Come.

175
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,989
我給你騰個地方，來吧
We will adjust. Come.

176
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,669
不不，你們去吧，好好玩
No, no. You go. You guys carry on.

177
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,774
冇事的夥計
It's okay, buddy.

178
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,449
現在隻有一個空位了，對吧？
One spot is available now, right?

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
太棒了! 謝謝
Yeah! Thanks.

180
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:32,869
你確定你不來嗎？
You're sure you won't come?

181
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,763
你會錯過很多好玩的
You will miss a lot.

182
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,446
拿著這個米納
Hold this Meena.

183
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:42,629
我們走
Let's go.

184
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,023
- 再見-再見
Bye, you guys. - Bye.

185
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:08,333
別緊張，我們一起做題
Don't be tense. We will do the paper.

186
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,291
放鬆
Just relax.

187
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,135
謝謝
Thanks.

188
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,670
我是瓦蒂卡-拉塔瓦爾，我知道，我知道
I'm Vartika. - Ratawal. I know. I know.

189
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,749
對不起，你剛才自我介紹了
Sorry. You introduced yourself earlier.

190
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,627
好吧
Okay.

191
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,193
對不起，我剛才冇聽到你的名字
Sorry. Actually I didn't hear your name earlier.

192
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,266
這就是我再次自我介紹的原因，希望你能再說一遍名字
That's why I introduced myself again hoping you would repeat your name.

193
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,749
你叫什麼名字?-瓦伊巴夫，瓦伊巴夫 · 拉塔瓦爾
So, your name? - Vaibhav. Vaibhav Ratawal.

194
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,479
哦，對不起，我怎麼可能是拉塔瓦? 瓦伊巴夫潘迪
Oh, sorry. How can I be Ratawal? Vaibhav Pandey.

195
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,402
有點尷尬，不是嗎？
It was a little awkward, wasn't it?

196
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,382
不過別擔心
But don't worry.

197
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,122
我們一起解決這張試卷-好的
We will solve the paper. - Okay.

198
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,749
你... 對不起，放鬆點-不，不，謝謝
You.. Sorry. Just relax. - No, no. Thank you.

199
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:51,749
走吧？
Shall we?

200
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,674
真是諷刺! 冷咖啡是這裏最有名的菜品
What irony! The cold coffee is the most famous dish at Chai paani.

201
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:15,980
一杯冷咖啡
One cold coffee.

202
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,121
二杯
Two.

203
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,685
施凡吉，你在醫學組，是嗎？
Shivangi, you are in Medical, aren't you?

204
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,978
我小的時候也想成為一名醫生，但是..
I too wanted to be a doctor when I was young but..

205
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:26,377
但是什麼？
But what?

206
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,389
但當我長大後，我變得非常情緒化
But when I grew up I turned out to be pretty emotional.

207
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,875
我爸爸說醫生不能這麼情緒化
My dad said doctors can't be so emotional..

208
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,389
所以我選擇了工程學
..so, I chose engineering.

209
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,657
- 你也很情緒化?-是的
You too are emotional? - Yes.

210
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,344
看看這個問題-是的，問題
Look at this question. - Yes. Question.

211
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,462
首先，你不應該看這個問題
Firstly, you shouldn't see the question.

212
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,189
什麼？
what?

213
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,478
傑圖·拜亞說要先檢查問題的最後一行
Jeetu Bhaiya says to check the last line of the question first.

214
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,187
然後再檢查一下選項
Then one should check the options.

215
00:12:56,744 --> 00:13:00,795
例如，這裏說，容器的溫度是多少？
For example, it says here what will the temperature of the vessel be?

216
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,509
看看這些選擇
Look at the options.

217
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,346
溫度不能用焦耳、摩爾或卡路裏來計算
The temperature can't be calculated in joules, moles or calories.

218
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,527
所以，選項D"25攝氏度"是正確答案
So, D 25 celcius is the correct answer.

219
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,309
這根本不是什麼熱量的問題
This wasn't a thermo question at all.

220
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,300
這是一個常識性的問題
It was a common sense question.

221
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,712
哦，是的! 我都冇有註意到
Oh, yes! Actually I did not pay attention.

222
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,901
順便問一下，你哥哥也在印度理工學院嗎？
By the way, is your brother also in IIT?

223
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,789
不，不，兄弟是一個複合體
No, no. Brother is a Compounder.

224
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:25,749
什麼？
What?

225
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,749
你是問傑圖·拜亞，拜亞哥是在印度理工-我明白了
Jeetu Bhaiya. Jeetu Bhaiya is in IIT. - I see.

226
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,265
他在神童教書-好的
He teaches at Prodigy. - Okay.

227
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,160
是的
Yes.

228
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,589
我也應該在一開始就參加課程
I too should have joined classes at the beginning.

229
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:36,497
現在一切都亂套了
Everything is in a mess now.

230
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,499
別擔心
Don't worry.

231
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,469
我會幫你把睏境轉變為理由
I'll convert your mess into reasons.

232
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:41,912
好的理由
Good reasons.

233
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:44,429
好吧
Okay.

234
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,429
我們看下一道題?-好的
Shall we do the next? - Yes.

235
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,408
讀最後一行
Read the last line.

236
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,887
別靠太近
Stay in your limits.

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,323
這裏有很好的家庭氣氛，不是嗎?-是的
This is such a good family atmosphere, isn't it? - Yes.

238
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:11,589
下次我會帶我的父母來這裏-是的
Next time I shall bring my parents here. - Yes.

239
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:18,973
烏代！
Uday!

240
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,510
你覺得讓他們倆單獨相處合適嗎？
You think it is proper to leave the two of them alone?

241
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,330
你害怕米納？
You're afraid of Meena?

242
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,669
我是為米納擔心
I am afraid for Meena.

243
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:27,669
你確定？
You're sure?

244
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,869
第一年就要結束了，但我還是不知道你的全名
The entire year is about to end but I still don't know your whole name.

245
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,955
米納，你姓什麼？
Meena, what is your surname?

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,069
我姓米納，我的名字叫巴爾穆昆德
My surname is Meena. My name is Balmukund Meena.

247
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,913
大家都可愛地叫我米納
Everybody endearingly calls me Meena.

248
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,005
你被親切地稱呼為什麼?-傑姆庫迪
What are you called endearingly? - Jhamkudi.

249
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,483
傑姆庫迪，很好聽的名字-不是嗎？
Jhamkudi. It's a nice name. - Isn't it?

250
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,629
是的
Yes.

251
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,270
米娜爾太單純了
Meenal is so straight and simple.

252
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,961
我打賭她不會下象棋
I bet she doesn't play the knight in chess.

253
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,541
難道不是嗎？
Isn't that true?

254
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,295
米納和米娜爾會是很好的一對，不是嗎？
Incidentally Meena and Meenal would make a nice pair, wouldn't they?

255
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,588
米納和米娜爾，米納和米娜爾……
Meena, Meenal. Meenal, Meena.

256
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,730
女士優先
Ladies first.

257
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:29,029
謝謝，瓦巴夫-謝謝？
Thanks, Vaibhav. - For?

258
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,398
- 你幫我解決了所有的三張試卷-是的
You helped me solve all three papers. - Yes.

259
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,029
一天就結束了
I got through it all in one day.

260
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,552
我自己可能要花七天時間才能做完
I would have taken seven days to get through it.

261
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,029
冇錯，我們一天就熬過來了
That's right. We got through it all in one day.

262
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:42,343
是的-剩下的幾天都冇什麼事了
Yes, that is true. - Nothing is left for the remaining days.

263
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,782
不，不，我還有事
No, no. I have something left.

264
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,899
我要複習教學大綱
I shall revise the whole syllabus.

265
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:47,029
很好
Good.

266
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:52,029
好的，如果你有什麼問題就告訴我
Okay. Let me know if you have any problem.

267
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,776
好的，再見
Okay. Bye-bye.

268
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:01,029
順便說一下，我可以幫助你複習！
Incidentally, I could help you with your revision. Yes!

269
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,486
我可以幫你複習
I could help you with your revision.

270
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:05,108
我很有天賦，我可以幫助任何人記住任何東西
I am very talented. I can help anyone memorize anything.

271
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,694
要我提醒你的立場嗎？
Shall I remind you of your position?

272
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:08,029
烏代，兄弟，我不能出去
Uday, bro I can't go out.

273
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,720
我必須要學習，很快要改組考試了
I have to study. I have my reshuffling exam. Non sense!

274
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:15,069
是的，我冇有出去，我在學習
Yes, well. I didn't go out. I was studying.

275
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,847
你冇在學習，無賴
You weren't studying, scoundrel.

276
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,022
你整天都在調情
You were clinging.

277
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,144
跟她
Onto her.

278
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,253
聽著，你今天教她解題了，是嗎？
Listen. You sat up to teach her today, didn't you?

279
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,979
明天教教她睡姿-閉嘴! 流氓！
Teach her in a sleeping position tomorrow. - Shut up! Scoundrel!

280
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,108
這是事實，不是嗎，米納？
It is the truth. Isn't that right, Meena?

281
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,361
他怎麼了？
What's the matter with him?

282
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,989
迪帕克是瘋了嗎？
Has your Deepak lost his mind?

283
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,269
他是不是不想開培訓班了？
Doesn't he want to run the coaching classes anymore?

284
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,260
我跟他說了來見你
I told him to come and see you.

285
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:45,909
- 你告訴他了?-是的
You told him? - Yes.

286
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,900
好吧
Well, alright.

287
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,569
你告訴他我的名字了嗎？
What did you tell him my name is?

288
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,538
我是梅塔副校長！
Vice-Principal Mehta sir.

289
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,088
年輕的心 -我明白了，就是你
Modern heart. - I see. That's you.

290
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,789
你去吧，我來對付他
You go. I will deal with him.

291
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,313
下一個！
Next!

292
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,509
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦爾
Vartika Ratawal.

293
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,821
“我說了”
"I said it."

294
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,508
“你說對了”
"You said it."

295
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,053
“僅此而已”
"That's all it is."

296
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,293
“我忍受了”
"I endured it."

297
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,185
“你忍受了”
"You endured it."

298
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:37,091
“但現在不是了”
"But not anymore."

299
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,594
再見，夥計們，再見
Bye, guys. See you.

300
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,744
我覺得這樣不對
I don't feel right about this.

301
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,671
為什麼? 你不喜歡嗎？
Why? Didn't you enjoy?

302
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,449
我可以教你更好的，如果你喜歡，我還會講笑話
I can teach you even better. I can even crack jokes if you like.

303
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,468
什麼？不，我不是這個意思
What? No, that's not what I meant.

304
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,668
你想和他們一起出去玩，而我卻把你留在這裏
You wanted to go out with them and I kept you here.

305
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,075
不不不
Oh! No. No. No.

306
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,749
不是這樣的
It's not that.

307
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:10,206
我也是很想學習的
Even I wanted to do my revision.

308
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,749
我還要準備參加馬赫什瓦裏的考試
Even I have to sit for Maheshwari's exam.

309
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,539
你也一樣嗎?-是的，真的
Even you have to sit for it? - Yes, really.

310
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,029
我為什麼要撒謊？
Why would I lie?

311
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,382
-我又冇說你在撒謊-冇錯
When did I say you were lying? - Yes.

312
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:21,749
是的，冇錯
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

313
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,593
該死！
Crap!

314
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,076
如果是這樣的話，那也冇關係，我們可以一起學習
If that's the case, then it's okay. We could study together.

315
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:34,082
是的，這真是個好主意
Yes, we can. It's a good idea. It's possible.

316
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,642
順便問一下，你選了哪個中心？
By the way, which center did you get?

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,011
我還不知道
I haven't got it as yet.

318
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,690
很快就知道了，等我填好錶格
I will get it. I will get it when I fill the form.

319
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,077
你還冇填錶嗎?-冇有
You haven't filled the form as yet? - No.

320
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,412
今天是最後一天
Today is the last date.

321
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:51,549
什麼？
What?

322
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,459
不要脫掉外套
Don't take off your jackets.

323
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,418
校服不要漏出來
The uniform should not be visible.

324
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,361
我來點單，你們坐好了
I will place the order. You sit tight.

325
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:21,749
什麼也別說
Don't say a word.

326
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,749
無論如何，絕對不要把身份證拿出來
No matter what, never show your I-card.

327
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,629
如果有人問你要身份證，驕傲地告訴他們
If anyone asks for your ID, tell them proudly.

328
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,286
我冇有-我冇有
I don't have it. - I don't have it.

329
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,629
我冇有，叔叔
I don't have it, uncle.

330
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,115
先生，你必須出示身份證才能坐在這裏
Sir, you have to present an ID to sit here.

331
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,629
為什麼?-這樣我們就能確認你的年齡了
Why do I have to present it? - So we know your age.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
那你問我就好了嘛
So, ask me my age.

333
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,254
十七
Seventeen.

334
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:49,014
裏麵的燈光真好看?-反射
Lights were so amazing inside, weren't they? - Reflection.

335
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,618
我一開始就告訴你了，我們去塔拉普島吧
I told you in the first place. Let's go to Talap..

336
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,229
但是你根本不聽
..but you don't want to pay heed to me.

337
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:56,014
寶貝，那邊也要查身份證的
Baby, they demand IDs even over there.

338
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,617
那他們一定是查客人，而不是查員工
They must be demanding them from others, not from the staff.

339
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,065
米納，給我一支筆-好的
Meena, give me a marker. - Yes.

340
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,229
過來
Back.

341
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,481
- 謝謝-冇事
Thank you, ma'am. - Never mind that.

342
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,197
填好錶格，盡快交回
Fill the form and return it quickly.

343
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,376
你也是處女座的?-是的
You too are a Virgo? - Yes.

344
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,389
你也是?-不，我前男朋友是
You too? - No. My boyfriend was.

345
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,308
哦！
Oh!

346
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,331
你現在冇有男朋友?-冇有，我們分手了
You don't have a boyfriend now? - No, we broke up.

347
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,549
很好很好
Good. Good.

348
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,549
你們為什麼分手?-他從不學習
Why did you break up? - He never studies.

349
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,549
這樣不行，不學習怎麼行
That is wrong. That is very wrong.

350
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,961
我熱愛學習，學習使我快樂
I study a lot. I love studies.

351
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
我的意思是，不是所有的處女座都一樣，對吧？
I mean to say, not all Virgos are the same. Right?

352
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,115
有些處女座的人工作努力，有些人富有同情心
Some Virgos are hard-working. Some are compassionate.

353
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,549
有些是情人
Some are lovers.

354
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,146
友情，友情……
Friendly lovers. Friendly lovers.

355
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,999
刻闆印象是錯誤的
It's wrong to stereotype. It's wrong to stereotype.

356
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:51,008
你說對不對，阿姨?-填好錶格，盡快交回來
What do you think, sister? - Fill the form and return it quickly.

357
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,668
你對這個女孩的愛讓你悶在這裏學習，還要教她解題
Your love for the girl made you study and you even taught her.

358
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:02,669
現在你還去填寫了馬赫什瓦裏的錶格？
Now you went and filled Maheshwari's form too?

359
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,909
愛情是盲目的，兄弟，不是瘋狂的
Love is blind, bro, not insane.

360
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,729
對吧，米納？
Right, Meena?

361
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,429
你每天都帶他去什麼地方？
Where have you been taking him every day?

362
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,789
我想明年應該還會再見到你的
I guess I will see you again next year.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,375
不，不，先生..
No, no. Sir..

364
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:22,589
我一定來參加期末考試
..I shall come for the final exam.

365
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,055
你會來嗎?-當然
You will come? - Certainly.

366
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,250
當然?-當然
Certainly? - Certainly

367
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,533
你保證？
Promise?

368
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,408
我保證
Promise.

369
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,392
去吧
Go there.

370
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,402
下一個
Next.

371
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:37,789
瓦蒂卡
Vartika.

372
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,229
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦爾
Vartika Ratawal.

373
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,703
“就像一場夢”
"Like a dream."

374
00:22:57,412 --> 00:22:58,618
“就像天堂”
"Like heaven."

375
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,682
“這個世界曾經是”
"This world used to be."

376
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:04,141
“看，現在它在燃燒”
"Look, now it's burning."

377
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,016
“你問我”
"And you ask me."

378
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,027
“我為什麼不高興? ”
"Why I am upset?"

379
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,117
你家很漂亮-謝謝
Your house is very nice. - Thank you.

380
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,658
有時候我覺得自己像是在轉移話題
Sometimes I feel like shifting here.

381
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,740
- 什麼?-為了學習
Huh? - For studies.

382
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,309
女士優先
Ladies first.

383
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,553
嘿，小子!-是誰？
Hey, boy! - Who is it?

384
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,040
擡頭
Up. Up.

385
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,235
你好，叔叔-嗯，好的
Greetings, uncle. - Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

386
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,269
你不能進來
You cannot come in.

387
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,213
為什麼?-這個出租屋是女生的
Why? - This PG is for girls.

388
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:30,784
我昨天讓你進來了
I allowed you yesterday.

389
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:32,686
我還以為你是她哥哥呢-叔叔！
I thought you must be her brother. - Uncle!

390
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,469
我不是她哥哥-所以我才不讓你進來！
I am not her brother. - That's why I say, out!

391
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,071
叔叔，你把我當成她的男朋友了，是不是？
Uncle, you are confusing me for her boyfriend, aren't you?

392
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,127
不，我們是好朋友-走! 離開這裏！
No. Close friend. - Go! Get out of here!

393
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:45,497
這什麼人啊? 他在公開場合叫我兄弟
What kind of an uncle is he? He is publicly calling me brother.

394
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:49,568
你哥哥會生氣的-快點! 走吧！
Your brother will be offended. - Come on! Get going!

395
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,117
喔！
Whoo!

396
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,101
請等一下，先不要進來
One moment. Don't come inside. Please. Please.

397
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,006
你的房東阿姨在這兒，不會有問題吧？
Your aunty won't have a problem here, will she?

398
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,366
不，不，阿姨會有什麼問題呢？
No, no. What problem would aunty have?

399
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,860
烏代每天都把施萬吉帶到這裏

400
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,869
我第一次帶女孩來-什麼？
I have brought a girl with me for the first time. - What?

401
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,229
我是說朋友，朋友-是的
I mean friend. Friend. - Yes.

402
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,105
你在瞎操心，讓我進來吧
You are needlessly worrying. Let me come in.

403
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,470
不! 不! 不! 不! 別進來，就兩分鍾，求你了
No! No! No! No! Don't come in. Two minutes. Please.

404
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,779
我見過更髒的房間
I have seen dirtier rooms.

405
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:48,069
你每天都洗澡，對吧? 這就夠了
You shower every day, right? That will suffice.

406
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,789
嗒噠！
Ta-dah!

407
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,531
請坐
Please.

408
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:56,228
那麼，我們今天要研究引力
Yes. So, we shall study gravitation today.

409
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,436
引力
Gravitation.

410
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,327
萬有引力非常的神奇
Gravitation is such a nice thing.

411
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,862
萬有引力有一種美麗的香味
Gravitation has a beautiful fragrance.

412
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,368
兩個未知的身體互相吸引
The attraction of two unknown bodies for each other.

413
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,182
生活在彼此的周圍
Living their lives around each other.

414
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,159
一圈又一圈
Round and round.

415
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,346
一圈又一圈
Round and round.

416
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:21,414
一圈又一圈
Round and round.

417
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:22,406
瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

418
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,511
我們能放棄引力嗎？
Can we ditch gravitation?

419
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,423
為什麼?-我的力學很弱
Why? - I am very weak with SHM.

420
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:30,050
所以，可以嗎？
So, can we do that first?

421
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,076
好的好的，當然了，我知道力學的
Yes, yes. I know it. Why wouldn't I know SHM?

422
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,473
力學非常簡單
SHM is very easy.

423
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:39,498
我知道-但是我什麼時候說你不懂力學？
I know it. - But when did I say you don't know SHM?

424
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,674
冇有，你冇說過
Exactly. Exactly. You didn't say that. You didn't say that.

425
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,856
力學
SHM.

426
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:52,933
哦，糟糕! 哦，不! 到我鍛煉的時間了
Oh, crap! Oh, no! It's time for my exercise.

427
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,612
糟糕糟糕！
Oh, crap! Crap!

428
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,178
我不管你在做什麼，你怎麼能不接我的電話呢？
I don't care what you were doing. How could you not answer my call?

429
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,511
首先，你不用學習，你隻是到處閒逛
Firstly, you don't study. You just wander off anywhere.

430
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:15,867
寶貝，別喊，會有人聽到的
Baby, don't yell. Someone will hear you.

431
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:16,966
為什麼我不能喊？
Why shouldn't I yell?

432
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:17,846
為什麼？
Why shouldn't I yell?

433
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,231
因為我會改過自新，我會改變
Because I will mend my ways. I will change.

434
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,789
我也會學習，事實上，我正在學習
I will study too. In fact, I am studying.

435
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:26,127
力、嚮量、平衡、化合物、複合
Force. Vector. Equilibrium. Irrational. Compound. Complex.

436
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:31,509
你好
Hello.

437
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:34,427
兄弟，你知道我和施萬吉在一起，對吧？
Bro, you know I'm out with Shivangi, don't you?

438
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,789
那你為什麼現在給我打電話? 你破壞了一個浪漫的時刻
Then why are you calling me now? You spoiled a romantic moment.

439
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:41,840
對不起，夥計，瓦蒂卡來了-哦！
I'm sorry, buddy. Vartika has come. - Oh!

440

Condoms are kept in H.C.Verma, part 2, the semi-conductors.

441
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:46,749
你在說什麼？
What are you saying?

442
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,349
我要非學院的登錄密碼
I want the login password for Unacademy.

443
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,636
- 你做不到的，孩子-我也不想做
'You won't be able to do it, boy.' - I don't want to do it either.

444
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,837
我們隻是朋友，好嗎
We are just friends, okay.

445
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,744
密碼就是"密碼"，小寫全拚

446

為什麼？

00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
到死都是處男

親愛的同學們，讓我們來看看今天的彈簧座係統

459

00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:03,366
所有的考點和時間

You can watch it on the Unacademy app from and to any chapter.

467
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,309
你一直看這個流量夠用嗎?-冇事
Don't you lose data if you check it all the time? - No.

Why are you so tense for Maheshwari's entrance test?

471
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,329
因為很難

Oh! - So, I felt at least if I make it to Maheshwari..

477
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,577
就能獲得考上印度理工學院的信心
..I will gain confidence that I can get to IIT..

478
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:44,334
但我覺得我冇有任何機會
..but I did not feel I had any chance.

479
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:48,786
你知道我在這四天裏學到的東西比一年裏學到的還要多
You know I've learned more in these 4 days than I did through the year.

480
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,327
我開始覺得自己像個白癡

謝謝你幫我重建自信

你為什麼不早點來科塔？

It's okay if you don't tell us, but make sure you tell her.

Once the exam gets over tomorrow, Lord knows when you'll see her again.

488
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,034
