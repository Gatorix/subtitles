1
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:06,787
记一下你们的假期作业
All of you, write down the homework you have to do.

2
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:13,146
课后习题第32至38题
Problem number 32 to 38 on the sheet.

3
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,149
然后呢?-然后？
And? - And?

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,869
-就这些？-就这？
And that's it. - That's it?

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,869
拜亚哥，我们有五天的假期
Bhaiya we have five days off.

6
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,429
再加点作业吧，我们能做完的
Give us some more. We will do it.

7
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,060
是的，我知道，所以不再加了
Yes, I know. That's why I am not giving you more.

8
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,032
这五天是学校的实践日
These five days are for the school's practical.

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,156
你们都好好放松一下，好吗？
All of you will focus on that and relax. Okay?

10
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,149
放松？
Relax?

11
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,909
是的，改组考试将在假期结束后的第15天进行
Yes. And your reshuffling exams will be held in 15 days of returning.

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,629
13天，拜亚哥-对，13天
13 days, sir. 13 days. - Listen. 13 days.

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,599
到时候你们再像个疯子一样学习
Then you have to study like a lunatic then.

14
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,149
是时候给你们的电池充充电了
Charge your battery a little.

15
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,629
好好放松一下，缓解压力
You won't burn out if you relax a little along with your studies.

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,629
但是你们所有人都要把注意力放在学校上
But all of you will focus on school.

17
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,949
乌代，你在想什么?-没什么
Uday, what's on your mind? - Sir.

18
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,716
这并不意味着你们就可以懒散了
That doesn't mean all of you laze completely. Just sleeping.

19
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:55,933
冷静一点
Chill a little.

20
00:00:58,263 --> 00:00:59,777
你们中有多少人明天一早要去上学？
How many of you will be going to school for the first tomorrow?

21
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:00,725
举起手来
Put your hands up.

22
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,309
太棒了! 你们都是未来的国家栋梁
Bravo! This is the cream of our country.

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,259
非常好！
Very good!

24
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,189
字写得真好！
Superb handwriting!

25
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:38,925
实验报告是用草书写的
The lab report is written in cursive.

26
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,403
物有所值
Value for money.

27
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:46,594
他们给出的 g 值是8.2，不应该是9.8吗？
They have given 8.2 as the value for g. Shouldn't it be 9.8?

28
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:47,749
无知的家伙！
Ignorant chap!

29
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,749
如果你在实验室里得到9.8作为 g 的值...-是的
If you get 9.8 as the value of g in the lab.. - Yes.

30
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,396
那你肯定是作弊了，兄弟
Then you have certainly cheated, bro.

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,749
8.2看起来更真实
8.2 seems more realistic.

32
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,122
即使是A1组的学生也会从他那里买实验报告
Even the A1 batch buys lab reports from him.

33
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,698
为了节省8个小时花了我700卢比
It cost me 700 rupees to save 8 hours.

34
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:06,149
300卢比，400卢比是为了租车
No. 300 rupees. 400 rupees was for the scooty rental.

35
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,223
你那破车我只骑了两天，这还要收我钱吗？
Are you going to charge me just because I used your scooty for 2 days?

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,367
不不不，是我租的另一辆车
No, no. Not mine. The other one that I have rented.

37
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:17,284
4天只要400卢比，是不是很划算？
Only 400 rupees for 4 days. Isn't it great deal?

38
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,469
施万吉说我做事没有条理
Shivangi says I am not organized.

39
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,469
等着瞧吧
Wait and watch.

40
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,411
什么另一辆？
What other one?

41
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,948
给谁租的? 花了我400卢比? ！
And for whom? It cost me 400 rupees?!

42
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,271
你想让我们四个在一辆摩托车上叠罗汉吗？
You expect the four of us to sit one on top of the other?

43
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,309
我太机智了，我已经在车里加满油
I am so sly. I've already filled petrol in the scooty.

44
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:36,469
- 什么四个人?-你，我，施万吉和瓦蒂卡
What four people? - You, me, Shivangi and Vartika.

45
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,029
哪个瓦蒂卡?-拉塔瓦尔
Vartika who? - Ratawal.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,829
- 拉塔瓦尔是谁?-希万吉的朋友
Ratawal who? - Shivangi's friend.

47
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,825
你在说什么，兄弟? 讲清楚一点
What are you saying, bro? Quiet. Tell me calmly.

48
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,193
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

49
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,749
我应该保持沉默还是告诉你？
Should I remain quiet or should I tell you?

50
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,049
听着，我们有4天的休息时间
Look. We have a 4 day break.

51
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,465
没有辅导，没有家庭作业
No coaching. No homework.

52
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,081
我们一起去游览科塔
We will go on an excursion.

53
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,351
我另外租了一辆摩托车，这样我们四个……
I rented a scooty so that the four of us..

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,560
你，我，施万吉和她的朋友瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦尔可以好好逛一下科塔
..you, me, Shivangi and her friend Vartika Ratawal can sight see Kota.

55
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,035
是不是很酷？
Isn't that cool?

56
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,237
我哪儿也不去，我们有4天的休息时间
I am not going anywhere. We have a 4 day break.

57
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,056
瓦伊巴夫和我一起复习
Vaibhav and I will revise.

58
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,389
你要做什么?-学习
What will you do? - Study.

59
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,389
不，不，别这么做
No, no. Don't do it.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,853
拜亚哥说这几天要放松，所以你应该放松
Jeetu Bhaiya said to relax, so you should relax.

61
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,003
哦，是的
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,989
你也会留意老师在课上说的每一句话吗？
Do you also pay heed to everything the teachers say?

63
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,920
不然呢？
Is there another possibility?

64
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:39,115
你的思想如此纯洁，就像我一样
Your thoughts are so pure. Just like mine.

65
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,829
- 我不能去，兄弟 -去死吧！
I can't go, buddy. - Like hell!

66
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,530
我在车里加了400卢比的汽油
I filled 400 rupees worth of petrol in the scooty.

67
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,829
还花了500卢比租车，现在你告诉我你不去了
I paid 500 rupees to rent it. Now you're telling me you won't go.

68
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,509
听着，兄弟米纳和我想复习一遍教学大纲
Look, bro. Meena and I want to complete the whole syllabus..

69
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:56,777
在这四天里
..during these 4 days.

70
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,829
你总是这样
You always do this, buddy.

71
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:01,589
十胜节就是被你这样毁掉的
You ruined the Dussehra fair plans the same way.

72
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:02,661
等一下
One moment.

73
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,820
十胜节的时候我不在这里
I wasn't here at the time of the Dussehra fair.

74
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,489
没错，你当时不在，现在也不在
Exactly. You weren't here then and you aren't now either.

75
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,682
兄弟，施万吉最近一直躲着我
Bro. Shivangi has been avoiding me for a long time.

76
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,685
我不想她和我分手
I hope she doesn't break up with me.

77
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:25,663
她还没准备好让下一个男孩进入心房
She isn't even mean enough to wait for another boy to enter her life..

78
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,604
在她和我分手之前
..before she breaks up with me.

79
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,829
四天之内，我想去从三驾马车到塔拉普的所有地方
Within four days I want to go everywhere from Troika to Talap..

80
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,390
七大奇迹之一,
..seven wonders to C V garden,

81
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,829
从罗陀 · 克里希纳到站立的甘尼什吉
from Radha Krishna to standing Ganeshji

82
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,829
那样我们就能在科塔创造许多回忆
..so that we create so many memories here in Kota..

83
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,617
她就不会再想分手的事了
..even the thought of breaking up would torment her heart.

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,829
是不是很浪漫，兄弟
Basic romantic consumerism, buddy.

85
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,395
那就你们俩去好了
So, you go, bro.

86
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,152
为什么让我去做电灯泡？
Why are you making me the third wheel?

87
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,109
有些事没有电灯泡是做不成的，兄弟
Some things can't be done without a third wheel, bro.

88
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:58,829
她不会一个人来的，大家都去她才会来
She will come if all of us go out. She won't come alone.

89
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,670
但是我们还要复习，兄弟
But our revision, bro.

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,829
是的，我就是这个意思
Yes, that's what I was saying. ??

91
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,451
-由于某些不可抗力，我们不能一起复习了-听我说完……
Due to some unavoidable circumstances we won't be able to revise. - I am talking.

92
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:07,539
什么? 什么? 什么？
What? What? What?

93
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,761
我们还要在4天内复习教学大纲
We have to complete the whole syllabus in 4 days.

94
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,214
我想放松，拜亚哥说的
I want to relax. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

95
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,828
带我一起去吧，乌代
Take me with you, Uday.

96
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,829
你不会反悔吧? 答应我
You won't retract, will you? Promise me.

97
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,294
不会
No.

98
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,829
米纳？
Meena?

99
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,736
我想我也该放松一下了
I think even I should go.

100
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,538
当然，跟我一起去吧
Of course. Come along.

101
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,209
- 对吧? 谢谢-明年
Right? Thank you. - Next year.

102
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:36,829
一起参加十胜节集市
For the Dussehra fair.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,069
你去吧，我要学习
You go. I shall study.

104
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,069
拿着这个，给你一个游标卡尺
Take this. A Vernier caliper for you.

105
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,300
谢谢
Thanks.

106
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,439
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

107
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,585
你不是让我放松嘛，我在放松
Exactly what you told me to do. Relax.

108
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,949
实验进行得顺利吗?-非常顺利，先生
Is the coaching going well? - Very good, sir.

109
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:27,949
一定是的
It must be.

110
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,422
你都没有时间写你自己的实验报告
You don't have time to write your own lab report.

111
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,606
不是的，先生-我可以容忍 g 的最大值为7
No, sir. - I can tolerate the value of g up to 7.

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,269
但我不能容忍谎言
But I cannot tolerate lies.

113
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,803
你们这帮培训班的学生不尊重学校
You coaching students don't respect school.

114
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,481
你是第一次来学校，是吗?-不，先生
You have come to school for the first time, haven't you? - No, sir.

115
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,829
- 我来过-你又在撒谎
I came. - You're lying again.

116
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,560
没有，先生，我来过好几次
No, sir. I came several times.

117
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,429
在食堂吃泡芙要多少钱？
How much do puffs cost in the canteen?

118
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,909
你以为我是白痴吗? 我看笔迹就知道
You think I am an idiot? I can tell by looking at the handwriting..

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,229
施乐中心的小伙子写的
..the chap at the Xerox center has written it.

120
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,080
这是古普塔的笔迹
This is Gupta's handwriting.

121
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,308
你是从神童来的，是吗?-是的，先生
You are from Prodigy, aren't you? - Yes, sir.

122
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,023
你不可能来自马赫什瓦里
You can't be from Maheshwari.

123
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,368
告诉迪帕克我想见他
Tell Deepak I wish to see him.

124
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,645
如果他明天不来
If he doesn't come to see me by tomorrow..

125
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,442
我就让所有的神童学生都不及格
..I will fail all the Prodigy students.

126
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,116
然后你们继续努力学习吧
Then you can keep trying for the JEE advance.

127
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,628
- 明白了吗?-是的，先生
You understand? - Yes, sir.

128
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,909
下一个
Next.

129
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,727
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦尔
Vartika Ratawal.

130
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,679
米纳，我和乌代一起去玩
Meena. I will go with Uday.

131
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,909
那我怎么办?-你在家里放松
What about me relaxing? - You relax at home.

132
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,903
他们要去哪里？
Where are they going?

133
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:11,318
去游览科塔
To sightsee all of Kota, inside out.

134
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,810
这真是个好计划
That is such a nice plan.

135
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,149
瓦伊巴夫，你坐乌代的车，你坐我的
Vaibhav, you hop on Uday's vehicle and you come with me.

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,530
打扰了，朋友们，你们好
Excuse me. Hello, friends.

137
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,616
我能和你们一起去探索科塔吗？
Can I go with all of you to explore Kota?

138
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,960
你是?-米娜尔·帕雷克
You are? - Meenal Parekh.

139
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,983
她是书呆子……咳咳……别带她……咳咳
(fake coughs) Nerd Alert (fake coughs) Get rid of her.

140
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,588
- 你好-你好
Hello. - Hi.

141
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,703
非常欢迎你，但我们已经有四个人了
You're most welcome, but we are already four.

142
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,518
我们五个人坐不下的-六个
How can five of us go? - Six.

143
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,509
既然大家都要去，我也要去
Now that everyone is going I shall go too.

144
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,589
嗨，我是瓦伊巴夫-瓦蒂卡
Hi. I'm Vaibhav. - Vartika.

145
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,069
小施，还是你们一起去吧? 我们改天再聚
Shiv, why don't you all leave? I'll take a rain check.

146
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,989
我们在路上再买个垫子-不，不，我有
So we'll buy pads on the way. - No, no. I have some.

147
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,229
不不，这不是月经的问题
No. No. This is not about periods.

148
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,708
我收到了马赫什瓦里的入学试卷
I received Maheshwari's sample papers..

149
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,723
我一道题都不会做
..and I couldn't solve any of it.

150
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,469
所以，我应该留下来准备一下
So, I should stay back and prepare for it.

151
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,732
- 我为你制定了整个假期计划-是的
I made the entire plan for you. - Yes.

152
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,278
- 现在你要抛弃我们?-对不起
You're ditching us? - Sorry.

153
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,324
哦! 和这些无聊的人在一起
Oh! With these boring people..

154
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,679
- 我会觉得无聊的-她在开玩笑
..I will get bored. - She's joking.

155
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,789
- 我们才不无聊-是的
We are not boring. - Yes, yes.

156
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,629
我们都是有趣的灵魂
We are very intelligent.

157
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:30,629
这些问题有三十分钟肯定做完了-是的
These problems will be solved in 30 minutes. - Yes.

158
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:31,430
很简单
Very easy.

159
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,033
- 是的，是的，我会帮她解决的
By them. - Yes, yes. I'll help her solve it.

160
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,109
别担心，伙计们
No worries, guys.

161
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,509
- 施万吉，求你了-不行，瓦蒂卡，你必须去
Shivangi, please. - No. Vartika, this is not done.

162
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:44,122
- 求你了-求你了，施万吉，求你了
Please. - Please, Shivangi. Please.

163
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,216
好吧，继续学习吧
Okay. Go ahead and study.

164
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,758
好的，那我也不去了
Well, alright. Then I won't go either.

165
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:55,634
为什么？
Why?

166
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,669
你到底要改多少次主意？
How many times will you change your mind for one plan?

167
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,919
我们又不是去果阿
We aren't going to Goa.

168
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,684
我帮助她学习，这对她有帮助
I will help her study. It will be a help to her.

169
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:03,790
无论如何，你们四个人刚好
In any case you are a group of four.

170
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,069
米纳也能帮她学习
She will study and get help. Meena will do it.

171
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,909
不，我要出去玩，拜亚哥说要放松
No, no. I shall go out. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

172
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,909
没关系，乌代，这次我会做出牺牲的
It is okay, Uday. I shall make the sacrifice this time.

173
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,130
没关系-不，不，瓦巴夫，你也来
It's fine. - No, no, Vaibhav. You come too.

174
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,989
如果你不放松的话，你会精疲力尽的来吧
You will burn out if you don't relax. Come.

175
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,989
我给你腾个地方，来吧
We will adjust. Come.

176
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,669
不不，你们去吧，好好玩
No, no. You go. You guys carry on.

177
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,774
没事的伙计
It's okay, buddy.

178
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,449
现在只有一个空位了，对吧？
One spot is available now, right?

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
太棒了! 谢谢
Yeah! Thanks.

180
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:32,869
你确定你不来吗？
You're sure you won't come?

181
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,763
你会错过很多好玩的
You will miss a lot.

182
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,446
拿着这个米纳
Hold this Meena.

183
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:42,629
我们走
Let's go.

184
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,023
- 再见-再见
Bye, you guys. - Bye.

185
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:08,333
别紧张，我们一起做题
Don't be tense. We will do the paper.

186
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,291
放松
Just relax.

187
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,135
谢谢
Thanks.

188
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,670
我是瓦蒂卡-拉塔瓦尔，我知道，我知道
I'm Vartika. - Ratawal. I know. I know.

189
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,749
对不起，你刚才自我介绍了
Sorry. You introduced yourself earlier.

190
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,627
好吧
Okay.

191
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,193
对不起，我刚才没听到你的名字
Sorry. Actually I didn't hear your name earlier.

192
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,266
这就是我再次自我介绍的原因，希望你能再说一遍名字
That's why I introduced myself again hoping you would repeat your name.

193
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,749
你叫什么名字?-瓦伊巴夫，瓦伊巴夫 · 拉塔瓦尔
So, your name? - Vaibhav. Vaibhav Ratawal.

194
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,479
哦，对不起，我怎么可能是拉塔瓦? 瓦伊巴夫潘迪
Oh, sorry. How can I be Ratawal? Vaibhav Pandey.

195
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,402
有点尴尬，不是吗？
It was a little awkward, wasn't it?

196
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,382
不过别担心
But don't worry.

197
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,122
我们一起解决这张试卷-好的
We will solve the paper. - Okay.

198
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,749
你... 对不起，放松点-不，不，谢谢
You.. Sorry. Just relax. - No, no. Thank you.

199
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:51,749
走吧？
Shall we?

200
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,674
真是讽刺! 冷咖啡是这里最有名的菜品
What irony! The cold coffee is the most famous dish at Chai paani.

201
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:15,980
一杯冷咖啡
One cold coffee.

202
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,121
二杯
Two.

203
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,685
施凡吉，你在医学组，是吗？
Shivangi, you are in Medical, aren't you?

204
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,978
我小的时候也想成为一名医生，但是..
I too wanted to be a doctor when I was young but..

205
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:26,377
但是什么？
But what?

206
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,389
但当我长大后，我变得非常情绪化
But when I grew up I turned out to be pretty emotional.

207
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,875
我爸爸说医生不能这么情绪化
My dad said doctors can't be so emotional..

208
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,389
所以我选择了工程学
..so, I chose engineering.

209
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,657
- 你也很情绪化?-是的
You too are emotional? - Yes.

210
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,344
看看这个问题-是的，问题
Look at this question. - Yes. Question.

211
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,462
首先，你不应该看这个问题
Firstly, you shouldn't see the question.

212
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,189
什么？
what?

213
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,478
杰图·拜亚说要先检查问题的最后一行
Jeetu Bhaiya says to check the last line of the question first.

214
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,187
然后再检查一下选项
Then one should check the options.

215
00:12:56,744 --> 00:13:00,795
例如，这里说，容器的温度是多少？
For example, it says here what will the temperature of the vessel be?

216
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,509
看看这些选择
Look at the options.

217
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,346
温度不能用焦耳、摩尔或卡路里来计算
The temperature can't be calculated in joules, moles or calories.

218
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,527
所以，选项D"25摄氏度"是正确答案
So, D 25 celcius is the correct answer.

219
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,309
这根本不是什么热量的问题
This wasn't a thermo question at all.

220
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,300
这是一个常识性的问题
It was a common sense question.

221
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,712
哦，是的! 我都没有注意到
Oh, yes! Actually I did not pay attention.

222
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,901
顺便问一下，你哥哥也在印度理工学院吗？
By the way, is your brother also in IIT?

223
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,789
不，不，兄弟是一个复合体
No, no. Brother is a Compounder.

224
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:25,749
什么？
What?

225
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,749
你是问杰图·拜亚，拜亚哥是在印度理工-我明白了
Jeetu Bhaiya. Jeetu Bhaiya is in IIT. - I see.

226
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,265
他在神童教书-好的
He teaches at Prodigy. - Okay.

227
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,160
是的
Yes.

228
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,589
我也应该在一开始就参加课程
I too should have joined classes at the beginning.

229
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:36,497
现在一切都乱套了
Everything is in a mess now.

230
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,499
别担心
Don't worry.

231
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,469
我会帮你把困境转变为理由
I'll convert your mess into reasons.

232
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:41,912
好的理由
Good reasons.

233
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:44,429
好吧
Okay.

234
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,429
我们看下一道题?-好的
Shall we do the next? - Yes.

235
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,408
读最后一行
Read the last line.

236
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,887
别靠太近
Stay in your limits.

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,323
这里有很好的家庭气氛，不是吗?-是的
This is such a good family atmosphere, isn't it? - Yes.

238
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:11,589
下次我会带我的父母来这里-是的
Next time I shall bring my parents here. - Yes.

239
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:18,973
乌代！
Uday!

240
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,510
你觉得让他们俩单独相处合适吗？
You think it is proper to leave the two of them alone?

241
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,330
你害怕米纳？
You're afraid of Meena?

242
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,669
我是为米纳担心
I am afraid for Meena.

243
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:27,669
你确定？
You're sure?

244
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,869
第一年就要结束了，但我还是不知道你的全名
The entire year is about to end but I still don't know your whole name.

245
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,955
米纳，你姓什么？
Meena, what is your surname?

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,069
我姓米纳，我的名字叫巴尔穆昆德
My surname is Meena. My name is Balmukund Meena.

247
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,913
大家都可爱地叫我米纳
Everybody endearingly calls me Meena.

248
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,005
你被亲切地称呼为什么?-杰姆库迪
What are you called endearingly? - Jhamkudi.

249
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,483
杰姆库迪，很好听的名字-不是吗？
Jhamkudi. It's a nice name. - Isn't it?

250
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,629
是的
Yes.

251
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,270
米娜尔太单纯了
Meenal is so straight and simple.

252
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,961
我打赌她不会下象棋
I bet she doesn't play the knight in chess.

253
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,541
难道不是吗？
Isn't that true?

254
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,295
米纳和米娜尔会是很好的一对，不是吗？
Incidentally Meena and Meenal would make a nice pair, wouldn't they?

255
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,588
米纳和米娜尔，米纳和米娜尔……
Meena, Meenal. Meenal, Meena.

256
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,730
女士优先
Ladies first.

257
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:29,029
谢谢，瓦巴夫-谢谢？
Thanks, Vaibhav. - For?

258
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,398
- 你帮我解决了所有的三张试卷-是的
You helped me solve all three papers. - Yes.

259
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,029
一天就结束了
I got through it all in one day.

260
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,552
我自己可能要花七天时间才能做完
I would have taken seven days to get through it.

261
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,029
没错，我们一天就熬过来了
That's right. We got through it all in one day.

262
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:42,343
是的-剩下的几天都没什么事了
Yes, that is true. - Nothing is left for the remaining days.

263
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,782
不，不，我还有事
No, no. I have something left.

264
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,899
我要复习教学大纲
I shall revise the whole syllabus.

265
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:47,029
很好
Good.

266
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:52,029
好的，如果你有什么问题就告诉我
Okay. Let me know if you have any problem.

267
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,776
好的，再见
Okay. Bye-bye.

268
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:01,029
顺便说一下，我可以帮助你复习！
Incidentally, I could help you with your revision. Yes!

269
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,486
我可以帮你复习
I could help you with your revision.

270
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:05,108
我很有天赋，我可以帮助任何人记住任何东西
I am very talented. I can help anyone memorize anything.

271
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,694
要我提醒你的立场吗？
Shall I remind you of your position?

272
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:08,029
乌代，兄弟，我不能出去
Uday, bro I can't go out.

273
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,720
我必须要学习，很快要改组考试了
I have to study. I have my reshuffling exam. Non sense!

274
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:15,069
是的，我没有出去，我在学习
Yes, well. I didn't go out. I was studying.

275
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,847
你没在学习，无赖
You weren't studying, scoundrel.

276
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,022
你整天都在调情
You were clinging.

277
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,144
跟她
Onto her.

278
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,253
听着，你今天教她解题了，是吗？
Listen. You sat up to teach her today, didn't you?

279
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,979
明天教教她睡姿-闭嘴! 流氓！
Teach her in a sleeping position tomorrow. - Shut up! Scoundrel!

280
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,108
这是事实，不是吗，米纳？
It is the truth. Isn't that right, Meena?

281
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,361
他怎么了？
What's the matter with him?

282
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,989
迪帕克是疯了吗？
Has your Deepak lost his mind?

283
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,269
他是不是不想开培训班了？
Doesn't he want to run the coaching classes anymore?

284
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,260
我跟他说了来见你
I told him to come and see you.

285
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:45,909
- 你告诉他了?-是的
You told him? - Yes.

286
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,900
好吧
Well, alright.

287
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,569
你告诉他我的名字了吗？
What did you tell him my name is?

288
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,538
我是梅塔副校长！
Vice-Principal Mehta sir.

289
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,088
年轻的心 -我明白了，就是你
Modern heart. - I see. That's you.

290
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,789
你去吧，我来对付他
You go. I will deal with him.

291
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,313
下一个！
Next!

292
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,509
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦尔
Vartika Ratawal.

293
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,821
“我说了”
"I said it."

294
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,508
“你说对了”
"You said it."

295
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,053
“仅此而已”
"That's all it is."

296
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,293
“我忍受了”
"I endured it."

297
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,185
“你忍受了”
"You endured it."

298
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:37,091
“但现在不是了”
"But not anymore."

299
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,594
再见，伙计们，再见
Bye, guys. See you.

300
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,744
我觉得这样不对
I don't feel right about this.

301
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,671
为什么? 你不喜欢吗？
Why? Didn't you enjoy?

302
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,449
我可以教你更好的，如果你喜欢，我还会讲笑话
I can teach you even better. I can even crack jokes if you like.

303
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,468
什么？不，我不是这个意思
What? No, that's not what I meant.

304
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,668
你想和他们一起出去玩，而我却把你留在这里
You wanted to go out with them and I kept you here.

305
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,075
不不不
Oh! No. No. No.

306
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,749
不是这样的
It's not that.

307
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:10,206
我也是很想学习的
Even I wanted to do my revision.

308
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,749
我还要准备参加马赫什瓦里的考试
Even I have to sit for Maheshwari's exam.

309
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,539
你也一样吗?-是的，真的
Even you have to sit for it? - Yes, really.

310
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,029
我为什么要撒谎？
Why would I lie?

311
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,382
-我又没说你在撒谎-没错
When did I say you were lying? - Yes.

312
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:21,749
是的，没错
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

313
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,593
该死！
Crap!

314
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,076
如果是这样的话，那也没关系，我们可以一起学习
If that's the case, then it's okay. We could study together.

315
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:34,082
是的，这真是个好主意
Yes, we can. It's a good idea. It's possible.

316
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,642
顺便问一下，你选了哪个中心？
By the way, which center did you get?

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,011
我还不知道
I haven't got it as yet.

318
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,690
很快就知道了，等我填好表格
I will get it. I will get it when I fill the form.

319
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,077
你还没填表吗?-没有
You haven't filled the form as yet? - No.

320
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,412
今天是最后一天
Today is the last date.

321
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:51,549
什么？
What?

322
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,459
不要脱掉外套
Don't take off your jackets.

323
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,418
校服不要漏出来
The uniform should not be visible.

324
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,361
我来点单，你们坐好了
I will place the order. You sit tight.

325
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:21,749
什么也别说
Don't say a word.

326
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,749
无论如何，绝对不要把身份证拿出来
No matter what, never show your I-card.

327
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,629
如果有人问你要身份证，骄傲地告诉他们
If anyone asks for your ID, tell them proudly.

328
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,286
我没有-我没有
I don't have it. - I don't have it.

329
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,629
我没有，叔叔
I don't have it, uncle.

330
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,115
先生，你必须出示身份证才能坐在这里
Sir, you have to present an ID to sit here.

331
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,629
为什么?-这样我们就能确认你的年龄了
Why do I have to present it? - So we know your age.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
那你问我就好了嘛
So, ask me my age.

333
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,254
十七
Seventeen.

334
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:49,014
里面的灯光真好看?-反射
Lights were so amazing inside, weren't they? - Reflection.

335
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,618
我一开始就告诉你了，我们去塔拉普岛吧
I told you in the first place. Let's go to Talap..

336
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,229
但是你根本不听
..but you don't want to pay heed to me.

337
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:56,014
宝贝，那边也要查身份证的
Baby, they demand IDs even over there.

338
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,617
那他们一定是查客人，而不是查员工
They must be demanding them from others, not from the staff.

339
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,065
米纳，给我一支笔-好的
Meena, give me a marker. - Yes.

340
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,229
过来
Back.

341
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,481
- 谢谢-没事
Thank you, ma'am. - Never mind that.

342
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,197
填好表格，尽快交回
Fill the form and return it quickly.

343
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,376
你也是处女座的?-是的
You too are a Virgo? - Yes.

344
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,389
你也是?-不，我前男朋友是
You too? - No. My boyfriend was.

345
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,308
哦！
Oh!

346
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,331
你现在没有男朋友?-没有，我们分手了
You don't have a boyfriend now? - No, we broke up.

347
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,549
很好很好
Good. Good.

348
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,549
你们为什么分手?-他从不学习
Why did you break up? - He never studies.

349
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,549
这样不行，不学习怎么行
That is wrong. That is very wrong.

350
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,961
我热爱学习，学习使我快乐
I study a lot. I love studies.

351
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
我的意思是，不是所有的处女座都一样，对吧？
I mean to say, not all Virgos are the same. Right?

352
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,115
有些处女座的人工作努力，有些人富有同情心
Some Virgos are hard-working. Some are compassionate.

353
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,549
有些是情人
Some are lovers.

354
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,146
友情，友情……
Friendly lovers. Friendly lovers.

355
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,999
刻板印象是错误的
It's wrong to stereotype. It's wrong to stereotype.

356
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:51,008
你说对不对，阿姨?-填好表格，尽快交回来
What do you think, sister? - Fill the form and return it quickly.

357
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,668
你对这个女孩的爱让你闷在这里学习，还要教她解题
Your love for the girl made you study and you even taught her.

358
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:02,669
现在你还去填写了马赫什瓦里的表格？
Now you went and filled Maheshwari's form too?

359
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,909
爱情是盲目的，兄弟，不是疯狂的
Love is blind, bro, not insane.

360
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,729
对吧，米纳？
Right, Meena?

361
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,429
你每天都带他去什么地方？
Where have you been taking him every day?

362
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,789
我想明年应该还会再见到你的
I guess I will see you again next year.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,375
不，不，先生..
No, no. Sir..

364
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:22,589
我一定来参加期末考试
..I shall come for the final exam.

365
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,055
你会来吗?-当然
You will come? - Certainly.

366
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,250
当然?-当然
Certainly? - Certainly

367
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,533
你保证？
Promise?

368
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,408
我保证
Promise.

369
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,392
去吧
Go there.

370
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,402
下一个
Next.

371
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:37,789
瓦蒂卡

372
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,229
瓦蒂卡 · 拉塔瓦尔
Vartika Ratawal.

373
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,703
“就像一场梦”
"Like a dream."

374
00:22:57,412 --> 00:22:58,618
“就像天堂”
"Like heaven."

375
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,682
“这个世界曾经是”
"This world used to be."

376
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:04,141
“看，现在它在燃烧”
"Look, now it's burning."

377
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,016
“你问我”
"And you ask me."

378
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,027
“我为什么不高兴? ”
"Why I am upset?"

379
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,117
你家很漂亮-谢谢
Your house is very nice. - Thank you.

380
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,658
有时候我觉得自己像是在转移话题
Sometimes I feel like shifting here.

381
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,740
- 什么?-为了学习
Huh? - For studies.

382
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,309
女士优先
Ladies first.

383
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,553
嘿，小子!-是谁？
Hey, boy! - Who is it?

384
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,040
抬头
Up. Up.

385
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,235
你好，叔叔-嗯，好的
Greetings, uncle. - Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

386
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,269
你不能进来
You cannot come in.

387
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,213
为什么?-这个出租屋是女生的
Why? - This PG is for girls.

388
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:30,784
我昨天让你进来了
I allowed you yesterday.

389
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:32,686
我还以为你是她哥哥呢-叔叔！
I thought you must be her brother. - Uncle!

390
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,469
我不是她哥哥-所以我才不让你进来！
I am not her brother. - That's why I say, out!

391
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,071
叔叔，你把我当成她的男朋友了，是不是？
Uncle, you are confusing me for her boyfriend, aren't you?

392
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,127
不，我们是好朋友-走! 离开这里！
No. Close friend. - Go! Get out of here!

393
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:45,497
这什么人啊? 他在公开场合叫我兄弟
What kind of an uncle is he? He is publicly calling me brother.

394
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:49,568
你哥哥会生气的-快点! 走吧！
Your brother will be offended. - Come on! Get going!

395
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,117
喔！
Whoo!

396
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,101
请等一下，先不要进来
One moment. Don't come inside. Please. Please.

397
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,006
你的房东阿姨在这儿，不会有问题吧？
Your aunty won't have a problem here, will she?

398
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,366
不，不，阿姨会有什么问题呢？
No, no. What problem would aunty have?

399
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,860
乌代每天都把施万吉带到这里

我第一次带女孩来-什么？
I have brought a girl with me for the first time. - What?

401

我是说朋友，朋友-是的
I mean friend. Friend. - Yes.

402
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,105
你在瞎操心，让我进来吧

403
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,470
不! 不! 不! 不! 别进来，就两分钟，求你了
No! No! No! No! Don't come in. Two minutes. Please.

404
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,779
我见过更脏的房间
I have seen dirtier rooms.

405
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:48,069
你每天都洗澡，对吧? 这就够了
You shower every day, right? That will suffice.

406
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,789
嗒哒！
Ta-dah!

407
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,531
请坐
Please.

408
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:56,228
那么，我们今天要研究引力
Yes. So, we shall study gravitation today.

409
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,436
引力
Gravitation.

410
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,327
万有引力非常的神奇
Gravitation is such a nice thing.

411
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,862
万有引力有一种美丽的香味

412
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,368
两个未知的身体互相吸引

413

生活在彼此的周围

415
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,346
一圈又一圈

瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

418
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,511
我们能放弃引力吗？
Can we ditch gravitation?

419
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,423
为什么?-我的力学很弱
Why? - I am very weak with SHM.

420
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:30,050
所以，可以吗？
So, can we do that first?

421
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,076
好的好的，当然了，我知道力学的
Yes, yes. I know it. Why wouldn't I know SHM?

422
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,473
力学非常简单
SHM is very easy.

423
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:39,498
我知道-但是我什么时候说你不懂力学？
I know it. - But when did I say you don't know SHM?

424
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,674
没有，你没说过
Exactly. Exactly. You didn't say that. You didn't say that.

425
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,856
力学

426
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:52,933
哦，糟糕! 哦，不! 到我锻炼的时间了
Oh, crap! Oh, no! It's time for my exercise.

427
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,612
糟糕糟糕！
Oh, crap! Crap!

428
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,178
我不管你在做什么，你怎么能不接我的电话呢？
I don't care what you were doing. How could you not answer my call?

429
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,511
首先，你不用学习，你只是到处闲逛
Firstly, you don't study. You just wander off anywhere.

430
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:15,867
宝贝，别喊，会有人听到的
Baby, don't yell. Someone will hear you.

431
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:16,966
为什么我不能喊？
Why shouldn't I yell?

432
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:17,846
为什么？
Why shouldn't I yell?

433
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,231
因为我会改过自新，我会改变
Because I will mend my ways. I will change.

434
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,789
我也会学习，事实上，我正在学习
I will study too. In fact, I am studying.

435

Force. Vector. Equilibrium. Irrational. Compound. Complex.

436
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:31,509
你好
Hello.

437
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:34,427
兄弟，你知道我和施万吉在一起，对吧？
Bro, you know I'm out with Shivangi, don't you?

438
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,789
那你为什么现在给我打电话? 你破坏了一个浪漫的时刻
Then why are you calling me now? You spoiled a romantic moment.

439
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:41,840
对不起，伙计，瓦蒂卡来了-哦！

442
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,349
我要非学院的登录密码
I want the login password for Unacademy.

443
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,636
- 你做不到的，孩子-我也不想做
'You won't be able to do it, boy.' - I don't want to do it either.

444
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,837
我们只是朋友，好吗
We are just friends, okay.

445
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,744
密码就是"密码"，小写全拼

你知道我在这四天里学到的东西比一年里学到的还要多
You know I've learned more in these 4 days than I did through the year.
