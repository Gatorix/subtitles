1
00:00:05,468 --> 00:00:06,787
All of you, write down the homework you have to do.

2
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:13,146
Problem number 32 to 38 on the sheet.

3
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:17,149
And? - And?

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,869
And that's it. - That's it?

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,869
Bhaiya we have five days off.

6
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,429
Give us some more. We will do it.

7
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,060
Yes, I know. That's why I am not giving you more.

8
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,032
These five days are for the school's practical.

9
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,156
All of you will focus on that and relax. Okay?

10
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,149
Relax?

11
00:00:34,631 --> 00:00:36,909
Yes. And your reshuffling exams will be held in 15 days of returning.

12
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:39,629
13 days, sir. 13 days. - Listen. 13 days.

13
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:41,599
Then you have to study like a lunatic then.

14
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,149
Charge your battery a little.

15
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,629
You won't burn out if you relax a little along with your studies.

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,629
But all of you will focus on school.

17
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:49,949
Uday, what's on your mind? - Sir.

18
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:53,716
That doesn't mean all of you laze completely. Just sleeping.

19
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:55,933
Chill a little.

20
00:00:58,263 --> 00:00:59,777
How many of you will be going to school for the first tomorrow?

21
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:00,725
Put your hands up.

22
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:07,309
Bravo! This is the cream of our country.

23
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,259
Very good!

24
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:36,189
Superb handwriting!

25
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:38,925
The lab report is written in cursive.

26
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,403
Value for money.

27
00:01:42,014 --> 00:01:46,594
They have given 8.2 as the value for g. Shouldn't it be 9.8?

28
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:47,749
Ignorant chap!

29
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,749
If you get 9.8 as the value of g in the lab.. - Yes.

30
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,396
Then you have certainly cheated, bro.

31
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,749
8.2 seems more realistic.

32
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:58,122
Even the A1 batch buys lab reports from him.

33
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:02,698
It cost me 700 rupees to save 8 hours.

34
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:06,149
No. 300 rupees. 400 rupees was for the scooty rental.

35
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:10,223
Are you going to charge me just because I used your scooty for 2 days?

36
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,367
No, no. Not mine. The other one that I have rented.

37
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:17,284
Only 400 rupees for 4 days. Isn't it great deal?

38
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,469
Shivangi says I am not organized.

39
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,469
Wait and watch.

40
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:24,411
What other one?

41
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:26,948
And for whom? It cost me 400 rupees?!

42
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,271
You expect the four of us to sit one on top of the other?

43
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,309
I am so sly. I've already filled petrol in the scooty.

44
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:36,469
What four people? - You, me, Shivangi and Vartika.

45
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,029
Vartika who? - Ratawal.

46
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,829
Ratawal who? - Shivangi's friend.

47
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:41,825
What are you saying, bro? Quiet. Tell me calmly.

48
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:43,193
What are you saying?

49
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,749
Should I remain quiet or should I tell you?

50
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:50,049
Look. We have a 4 day break.

51
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,465
No coaching. No homework.

52
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,081
We will go on an excursion.

53
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:57,351
I rented a scooty so that the four of us..

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,560
..you, me, Shivangi and her friend Vartika Ratawal can sight see Kota.

55
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,035
Isn't that cool?

56
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,237
I am not going anywhere. We have a 4 day break.

57
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,056
Vaibhav and I will revise.

58
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:11,389
What will you do? - Study.

59
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:13,389
No, no. Don't do it.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,853
Jeetu Bhaiya said to relax, so you should relax.

61
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:20,003
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:28,989
Do you also pay heed to everything the teachers say?

63
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:30,920
Is there another possibility?

64
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:39,115
Your thoughts are so pure. Just like mine.

65
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,829
I can't go, buddy. - Like hell!

66
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,530
I filled 400 rupees worth of petrol in the scooty.

67
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,829
I paid 500 rupees to rent it. Now you're telling me you won't go.

68
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:55,509
Look, bro. Meena and I want to complete the whole syllabus..

69
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:56,777
..during these 4 days.

70
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:58,829
You always do this, buddy.

71
00:03:59,091 --> 00:04:01,589
You ruined the Dussehra fair plans the same way.

72
00:04:01,713 --> 00:04:02,661
One moment.

73
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,820
I wasn't here at the time of the Dussehra fair.

74
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,489
Exactly. You weren't here then and you aren't now either.

75
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,682
Bro. Shivangi has been avoiding me for a long time.

76
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,685
I hope she doesn't break up with me.

77
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:25,663
She isn't even mean enough to wait for another boy to enter her life..

78
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:28,604
..before she breaks up with me.

79
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,829
Within four days I want to go everywhere from Troika to Talap..

80
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:31,390
..seven wonders to C V garden,

81
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:34,829
from Radha Krishna to standing Ganeshji

82
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:37,829
..so that we create so many memories here in Kota..

83
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,617
..even the thought of breaking up would torment her heart.

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,829
Basic romantic consumerism, buddy.

85
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,395
So, you go, bro.

86
00:04:50,684 --> 00:04:52,152
Why are you making me the third wheel?

87
00:04:52,232 --> 00:04:55,109
Some things can't be done without a third wheel, bro.

88
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:58,829
She will come if all of us go out. She won't come alone.

89
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,670
But our revision, bro.

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,829
Yes, that's what I was saying. ??

91
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:05,451
Due to some unavoidable circumstances we won't be able to revise. - I am talking.

92
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:07,539
What? What? What?

93
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,761
We have to complete the whole syllabus in 4 days.

94
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,214
I want to relax. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

95
00:05:12,477 --> 00:05:13,828
Take me with you, Uday.

96
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:15,829
You won't retract, will you? Promise me.

97
00:05:18,128 --> 00:05:19,294
No.

98
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:21,829
Meena?

99
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:29,736
I think even I should go.

100
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,538
Of course. Come along.

101
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:34,209
Right? Thank you. - Next year.

102
00:05:35,455 --> 00:05:36,829
For the Dussehra fair.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,069
You go. I shall study.

104
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,069
Take this. A Vernier caliper for you.

105
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:56,300
Thanks.

106
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,439
What are you doing?

107
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,585
Exactly what you told me to do. Relax.

108
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,949
Is the coaching going well? - Very good, sir.

109
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:27,949
It must be.

110
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,422
You don't have time to write your own lab report.

111
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,606
No, sir. - I can tolerate the value of g up to 7.

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,269
But I cannot tolerate lies.

113
00:06:39,412 --> 00:06:41,803
You coaching students don't respect school.

114
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,481
You have come to school for the first time, haven't you? - No, sir.

115
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,829
I came. - You're lying again.

116
00:06:46,091 --> 00:06:47,560
No, sir. I came several times.

117
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,429
How much do puffs cost in the canteen?

118
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,909
You think I am an idiot? I can tell by looking at the handwriting..

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,229
..the chap at the Xerox center has written it.

120
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,080
This is Gupta's handwriting.

121
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,308
You are from Prodigy, aren't you? - Yes, sir.

122
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,023
You can't be from Maheshwari.

123
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,368
Tell Deepak I wish to see him.

124
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,645
If he doesn't come to see me by tomorrow..

125
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,442
..I will fail all the Prodigy students.

126
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,116
Then you can keep trying for the JEE advance.

127
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,628
You understand? - Yes, sir.

128
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,909
Next.

129
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,727
Vartika Ratawal.

130
00:07:58,171 --> 00:08:00,679
Meena. I will go with Uday.

131
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,909
What about me relaxing? - You relax at home.

132
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,903
Where are they going?

133
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:11,318
To sightsee all of Kota, inside out.

134
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,810
That is such a nice plan.

135
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,149
Vaibhav, you hop on Uday's vehicle and you come with me.

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,530
Excuse me. Hello, friends.

137
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:39,616
Can I go with all of you to explore Kota?

138
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,960
You are? - Meenal Parekh.

139
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,983
(fake coughs) Nerd Alert (fake coughs) Get rid of her.

140
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,588
Hello. - Hi.

141
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,703
You're most welcome, but we are already four.

142
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,518
How can five of us go? - Six.

143
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,509
Now that everyone is going I shall go too.

144
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,589
Hi. I'm Vaibhav. - Vartika.

145
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,069
Shiv, why don't you all leave? I'll take a rain check.

146
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,989
So we'll buy pads on the way. - No, no. I have some.

147
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,229
No. No. This is not about periods.

148
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,708
I received Maheshwari's sample papers..

149
00:09:10,788 --> 00:09:12,723
..and I couldn't solve any of it.

150
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,469
So, I should stay back and prepare for it.

151
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,732
I made the entire plan for you. - Yes.

152
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,278
You're ditching us? - Sorry.

153
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:20,324
Oh! With these boring people..

154
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,679
..I will get bored. - She's joking.

155
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,789
We are not boring. - Yes, yes.

156
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:27,629
We are very intelligent.

157
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:30,629
These problems will be solved in 30 minutes. - Yes.

158
00:09:30,891 --> 00:09:31,430
Very easy.

159
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:34,033
By them. - Yes, yes. I'll help her solve it.

160
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,109
No worries, guys.

161
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,509
Shivangi, please. - No. Vartika, this is not done.

162
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:44,122
Please. - Please, Shivangi. Please.

163
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,216
Okay. Go ahead and study.

164
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:54,758
Well, alright. Then I won't go either.

165
00:09:54,892 --> 00:09:55,634
Why?

166
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,669
How many times will you change your mind for one plan?

167
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,919
We aren't going to Goa.

168
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:01,684
I will help her study. It will be a help to her.

169
00:10:02,154 --> 00:10:03,790
In any case you are a group of four.

170
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,069
She will study and get help. Meena will do it.

171
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,909
No, no. I shall go out. Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

172
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,909
It is okay, Uday. I shall make the sacrifice this time.

173
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:16,130
It's fine. - No, no, Vaibhav. You come too.

174
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,989
You will burn out if you don't relax. Come.

175
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:18,989
We will adjust. Come.

176
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,669
No, no. You go. You guys carry on.

177
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:23,774
It's okay, buddy.

178
00:10:24,363 --> 00:10:26,449
One spot is available now, right?

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,560
Yeah! Thanks.

180
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:32,869
You're sure you won't come?

181
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,763
You will miss a lot.

182
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:40,446
Hold this Meena.

183
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:42,629
Let's go.

184
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,023
Bye, you guys. - Bye.

185
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:08,333
Don't be tense. We will do the paper.

186
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,291
Just relax.

187
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,135
Thanks.

188
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,670
I'm Vartika. - Ratawal. I know. I know.

189
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,749
Sorry. You introduced yourself earlier.

190
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:22,627
Okay.

191
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,193
Sorry. Actually I didn't hear your name earlier.

192
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:33,266
That's why I introduced myself again hoping you would repeat your name.

193
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,749
So, your name? - Vaibhav. Vaibhav Ratawal.

194
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:39,479
Oh, sorry. How can I be Ratawal? Vaibhav Pandey.

195
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,402
It was a little awkward, wasn't it?

196
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:44,382
But don't worry.

197
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,122
We will solve the paper. - Okay.

198
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,749
You.. Sorry. Just relax. - No, no. Thank you.

199
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:51,749
Shall we?

200
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,674
What irony! The cold coffee is the most famous dish at Chai paani.

201
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:15,980
One cold coffee.

202
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,121
Two.

203
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,685
Shivangi, you are in Medical, aren't you?

204
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:24,978
I too wanted to be a doctor when I was young but..

205
00:12:25,651 --> 00:12:26,377
But what?

206
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:29,389
But when I grew up I turned out to be pretty emotional.

207
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,875
My dad said doctors can't be so emotional..

208
00:12:33,158 --> 00:12:34,389
..so, I chose engineering.

209
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,657
You too are emotional? - Yes.

210
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,344
Look at this question. - Yes. Question.

211
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,462
Firstly, you shouldn't see the question.

212
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:50,189
what?

213
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,478
Jeetu Bhaiya says to check the last line of the question first.

214
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,187
Then one should check the options.

215
00:12:56,744 --> 00:13:00,795
For example, it says here what will the temperature of the vessel be?

216
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:02,509
Look at the options.

217
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,346
The temperature can't be calculated in joules, moles or calories.

218
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:09,527
So, D 25 celcius is the correct answer.

219
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,309
This wasn't a thermo question at all.

220
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,300
It was a common sense question.

221
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,712
Oh, yes! Actually I did not pay attention.

222
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,901
By the way, is your brother also in IIT?

223
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,789
No, no. Brother is a Compounder.

224
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:25,749
What?

225
00:13:27,047 --> 00:13:29,749
Jeetu Bhaiya. Jeetu Bhaiya is in IIT. - I see.

226
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,265
He teaches at Prodigy. - Okay.

227
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:32,160
Yes.

228
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,589
I too should have joined classes at the beginning.

229
00:13:34,907 --> 00:13:36,497
Everything is in a mess now.

230
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,499
Don't worry.

231
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,469
I'll convert your mess into reasons.

232
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:41,912
Good reasons.

233
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:44,429
Okay.

234
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,429
Shall we do the next? - Yes.

235
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,408
Read the last line.

236
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,887
Stay in your limits.

237
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,323
This is such a good family atmosphere, isn't it? - Yes.

238
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:11,589
Next time I shall bring my parents here. - Yes.

239
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:18,973
Uday!

240
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:21,510
You think it is proper to leave the two of them alone?

241
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,330
You're afraid of Meena?

242
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:24,669
I am afraid for Meena.

243
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:27,669
You're sure?

244
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,869
The entire year is about to end but I still don't know your whole name.

245
00:14:35,286 --> 00:14:37,955
Meena, what is your surname?

246
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,069
My surname is Meena. My name is Balmukund Meena.

247
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,913
Everybody endearingly calls me Meena.

248
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,005
What are you called endearingly? - Jhamkudi.

249
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:54,483
Jhamkudi. It's a nice name. - Isn't it?

250
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,629
Yes.

251
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,270
Meenal is so straight and simple.

252
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:00,961
I bet she doesn't play the knight in chess.

253
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,541
Isn't that true?

254
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:08,295
Incidentally Meena and Meenal would make a nice pair, wouldn't they?

255
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,588
Meena, Meenal. Meenal, Meena.

256
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,730
Ladies first.

257
00:15:27,596 --> 00:15:29,029
Thanks, Vaibhav. - For?

258
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,398
You helped me solve all three papers. - Yes.

259
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,029
I got through it all in one day.

260
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,552
I would have taken seven days to get through it.

261
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:39,029
That's right. We got through it all in one day.

262
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:42,343
Yes, that is true. - Nothing is left for the remaining days.

263
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,782
No, no. I have something left.

264
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,899
I shall revise the whole syllabus.

265
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:47,029
Good.

266
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:52,029
Okay. Let me know if you have any problem.

267
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,776
Okay. Bye-bye.

268
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:01,029
Incidentally, I could help you with your revision. Yes!

269
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:02,486
I could help you with your revision.

270
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:05,108
I am very talented. I can help anyone memorize anything.

271
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:06,694
Shall I remind you of your position?

272
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:08,029
Uday, bro I can't go out.

273
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,720
I have to study. I have my reshuffling exam. Non sense!

274
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:15,069
Yes, well. I didn't go out. I was studying.

275
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,847
You weren't studying, scoundrel.

276
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:18,022
You were clinging.

277
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,144
Onto her.

278
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:24,253
Listen. You sat up to teach her today, didn't you?

279
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:26,979
Teach her in a sleeping position tomorrow. - Shut up! Scoundrel!

280
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,108
It is the truth. Isn't that right, Meena?

281
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,361
What's the matter with him?

282
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:39,989
Has your Deepak lost his mind?

283
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,269
Doesn't he want to run the coaching classes anymore?

284
00:16:41,531 --> 00:16:43,260
I told him to come and see you.

285
00:16:44,452 --> 00:16:45,909
You told him? - Yes.

286
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,900
Well, alright.

287
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,569
What did you tell him my name is?

288
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,538
Vice-Principal Mehta sir.

289
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,088
Modern heart. - I see. That's you.

290
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,789
You go. I will deal with him.

291
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,313
Next!

292
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:07,509
Vartika Ratawal.

293
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,821
"I said it."

294
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,508
"You said it."

295
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:30,053
"That's all it is."

296
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,293
"I endured it."

297
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,185
"You endured it."

298
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:37,091
"But not anymore."

299
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,594
Bye, guys. See you.

300
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,744
I don't feel right about this.

301
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,671
Why? Didn't you enjoy?

302
00:17:55,011 --> 00:17:58,449
I can teach you even better. I can even crack jokes if you like.

303
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,468
What? No, that's not what I meant.

304
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,668
You wanted to go out with them and I kept you here.

305
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:06,075
Oh! No. No. No.

306
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:07,749
It's not that.

307
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:10,206
Even I wanted to do my revision.

308
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:12,749
Even I have to sit for Maheshwari's exam.

309
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:15,539
Even you have to sit for it? - Yes, really.

310
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:17,029
Why would I lie?

311
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:20,382
When did I say you were lying? - Yes.

312
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:21,749
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

313
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:23,593
Crap!

314
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,076
If that's the case, then it's okay. We could study together.

315
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:34,082
Yes, we can. It's a good idea. It's possible.

316
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,642
By the way, which center did you get?

317
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,011
I haven't got it as yet.

318
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,690
I will get it. I will get it when I fill the form.

319
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:48,077
You haven't filled the form as yet? - No.

320
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,412
Today is the last date.

321
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:51,549
What?

322
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,459
Don't take off your jackets.

323
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,418
The uniform should not be visible.

324
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,361
I will place the order. You sit tight.

325
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:21,749
Don't say a word.

326
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:25,749
No matter what, never show your I-card.

327
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,629
If anyone asks for your ID, tell them proudly.

328
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,286
I don't have it. - I don't have it.

329
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,629
I don't have it, uncle.

330
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,115
Sir, you have to present an ID to sit here.

331
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:37,629
Why do I have to present it? - So we know your age.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,520
So, ask me my age.

333
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,254
Seventeen.

334
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:49,014
Lights were so amazing inside, weren't they? - Reflection.

335
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:51,618
I told you in the first place. Let's go to Talap..

336
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:53,229
..but you don't want to pay heed to me.

337
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:56,014
Baby, they demand IDs even over there.

338
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,617
They must be demanding them from others, not from the staff.

339
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,065
Meena, give me a marker. - Yes.

340
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,229
Back.

341
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:56,481
Thank you, ma'am. - Never mind that.

342
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,197
Fill the form and return it quickly.

343
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:07,376
You too are a Virgo? - Yes.

344
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,389
You too? - No. My boyfriend was.

345
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,308
Oh!

346
00:21:13,651 --> 00:21:17,331
You don't have a boyfriend now? - No, we broke up.

347
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:19,549
Good. Good.

348
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,549
Why did you break up? - He never studies.

349
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,549
That is wrong. That is very wrong.

350
00:21:29,101 --> 00:21:31,961
I study a lot. I love studies.

351
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,560
I mean to say, not all Virgos are the same. Right?

352
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:41,115
Some Virgos are hard-working. Some are compassionate.

353
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:42,549
Some are lovers.

354
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,146
Friendly lovers. Friendly lovers.

355
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,999
It's wrong to stereotype. It's wrong to stereotype.

356
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:51,008
What do you think, sister? - Fill the form and return it quickly.

357
00:21:57,905 --> 00:22:00,668
Your love for the girl made you study and you even taught her.

358
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:02,669
Now you went and filled Maheshwari's form too?

359
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,909
Love is blind, bro, not insane.

360
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:07,729
Right, Meena?

361
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,429
Where have you been taking him every day?

362
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,789
I guess I will see you again next year.

363
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,375
No, no. Sir..

364
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:22,589
..I shall come for the final exam.

365
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,055
You will come? - Certainly.

366
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,250
Certainly? - Certainly

367
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:26,533
Promise?

368
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,408
Promise.

369
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:32,392
Go there.

370
00:22:34,341 --> 00:22:35,402
Next.

371
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:37,789
Vartika.

372
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,229
Vartika Ratawal.

373
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:56,703
"Like a dream."

374
00:22:57,412 --> 00:22:58,618
"Like heaven."

375
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,682
"This world used to be."

376
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:04,141
"Look, now it's burning."

377
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,016
"And you ask me."

378
00:23:07,057 --> 00:23:09,027
"Why I am upset?"

379
00:23:10,984 --> 00:23:13,117
Your house is very nice. - Thank you.

380
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,658
Sometimes I feel like shifting here.

381
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:16,740
Huh? - For studies.

382
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:20,309
Ladies first.

383
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,553
Hey, boy! - Who is it?

384
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,040
Up. Up.

385
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,235
Greetings, uncle. - Yes, yes. Okay, okay.

386
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,269
You cannot come in.

387
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,213
Why? - This PG is for girls.

388
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:30,784
I allowed you yesterday.

389
00:23:31,135 --> 00:23:32,686
I thought you must be her brother. - Uncle!

390
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,469
I am not her brother. - That's why I say, out!

391
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,071
Uncle, you are confusing me for her boyfriend, aren't you?

392
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,127
No. Close friend. - Go! Get out of here!

393
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:45,497
What kind of an uncle is he? He is publicly calling me brother.

394
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:49,568
Your brother will be offended. - Come on! Get going!

395
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,117
Whoo!

396
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:24,101
One moment. Don't come inside. Please. Please.

397
00:24:26,851 --> 00:24:29,006
Your aunty won't have a problem here, will she?

398
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:31,366
No, no. What problem would aunty have?

399
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,860
Uday brings Shivangi here every day.

400
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,869
I have brought a girl with me for the first time. - What?

401
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:38,229
I mean friend. Friend. - Yes.

402
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,105
You are needlessly worrying. Let me come in.

403
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:43,470
No! No! No! No! Don't come in. Two minutes. Please.

404
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,779
I have seen dirtier rooms.

405
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:48,069
You shower every day, right? That will suffice.

406
00:24:51,873 --> 00:24:53,789
Ta-dah!

407
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:55,531
Please.

408
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:56,228
Yes. So, we shall study gravitation today.

409
00:25:59,411 --> 00:26:01,436
Gravitation.

410
00:26:02,992 --> 00:26:05,327
Gravitation is such a nice thing.

411
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:08,862
Gravitation has a beautiful fragrance.

412
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:13,368
The attraction of two unknown bodies for each other.

413
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,182
Living their lives around each other.

414
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,159
Round and round.

415
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,346
Round and round.

416
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:21,414
Round and round.

417
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:22,406
Vaibhav.

418
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,511
Can we ditch gravitation?

419
00:26:26,011 --> 00:26:28,423
Why? - I am very weak with SHM.

420
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:30,050
So, can we do that first?

421
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,076
Yes, yes. I know it. Why wouldn't I know SHM?

422
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,473
SHM is very easy.

423
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:39,498
I know it. - But when did I say you don't know SHM?

424
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:42,674
Exactly. Exactly. You didn't say that. You didn't say that.

425
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:45,856
SHM.

426
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:52,933
Oh, crap! Oh, no! It's time for my exercise.

427
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,612
Oh, crap! Crap!

428
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:12,178
I don't care what you were doing. How could you not answer my call?

429
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,511
Firstly, you don't study. You just wander off anywhere.

430
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:15,867
Baby, don't yell. Someone will hear you.

431
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:16,966
Why shouldn't I yell?

432
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:17,846
Why shouldn't I yell?

433
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,231
Because I will mend my ways. I will change.

434
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,789
I will study too. In fact, I am studying.

435
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:26,127
Force. Vector. Equilibrium. Irrational. Compound. Complex.

436
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:31,509
Hello.

437
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:34,427
Bro, you know I'm out with Shivangi, don't you?

438
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,789
Then why are you calling me now? You spoiled a romantic moment.

439
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm sorry, buddy. Vartika has come. - Oh!

440
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:45,149
Condoms are kept in H.C.Verma, part 2, the semi-conductors.

441
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:46,749
What are you saying?

442
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:49,349
I want the login password for Unacademy.

443
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:54,636
'You won't be able to do it, boy.' - I don't want to do it either.

444
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:56,837
We are just friends, okay.

445
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:58,744
Its the password. All small.

446
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,920
He's a true IITian.

447
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:06,924
Why?

448
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
He'll die a virgin.

449
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:22,989
My dear students, let's have a look at the spring block system today.

450
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:26,029
This is the block. This is the spring. If I elongate the spring by..

451
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:29,029
Vaibhav! - Yes, I'm coming. Last two.

452
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,581
Breathe in.

453
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,849
Breathe out.

454
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:35,995
This is very useful at the last minute.

455
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:37,971
Thank you, bro.

456
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:42,557
We did it all.

457
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:44,753
The exam is tomorrow and I am not afraid.

458
00:28:44,913 --> 00:28:46,069
I mean, not that much.

459
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:48,349
I just have to read the doomsday notes and I'm done.

460
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:50,255
What notes? - Doomsday.

461
00:28:50,653 --> 00:28:51,308
Hold on.

462
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,000
These. For last minute revision.

463
00:28:55,507 --> 00:28:57,309
It contains the overview of each chapter.

464
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,341
Oh! I too have made this. Wait. I'll show you.

465
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:03,366
All the topics and time.

466
00:29:04,011 --> 00:29:06,869
You can watch it on the Unacademy app from and to any chapter.

467
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:10,309
Don't you lose data if you check it all the time? - No.

468
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:12,974
I download it offline. - Oh, I see.

469
00:29:13,205 --> 00:29:16,948
You've filled up such a big register. Seriously? - Yes.

470
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,330
Why are you so tense for Maheshwari's entrance test?

471
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,329
Because it is tough.

472
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:26,317
Yes, that it is, but we have covered everything.

473
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:28,869
What's the matter?

474
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,018
Actually

475
00:29:32,826 --> 00:29:34,626
my brother was in Maheshwari's top batch.

476
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,949
Oh! - So, I felt at least if I make it to Maheshwari..

477
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,577
..I will gain confidence that I can get to IIT..

478
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:44,334
..but I did not feel I had any chance.

479
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:48,786
You know I've learned more in these 4 days than I did through the year.

480
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,327
I had starting feeling like an idiot.

481
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:55,469
Thanks for restoring my confidence.

482
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,241
Why didn't you come to Kota earlier?

483
00:29:58,424 --> 00:29:59,817
We would've become friends earlier.

484
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:02,857
Yes.

485
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:06,248
What can I say?

486
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,696
It's okay if you don't tell us, but make sure you tell her.

487
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:13,819
Once the exam gets over tomorrow, Lord knows when you'll see her again.

488
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,034
The mood is set, bro. Propose to her.

489
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,989
Listen. Tomorrow is an auspicious day, right? Take this.

490
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:22,989
Go in style.

491
00:30:25,273 --> 00:30:26,763
"Like a dream."

492
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,468
"Like heaven."

493
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,535
"This world used to be."

494
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:34,130
"Look, now its burning."

495
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:36,027
"And you ask me."

496
00:30:36,931 --> 00:30:38,934
"Why I am upset?"

497
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:46,467
"Things won't work your way anymore."

498
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,346
"Say it."

499
00:30:48,426 --> 00:30:50,472
"Now and here."

500
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:53,832
"Long live love."

501
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,821
Bhaiya, you have yogurt? - Yes, you can have yogurt.

502
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:00,043
Take it from there.

503
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,221
And...

504
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,680
Sugar? - We have sugar too. There you go, bhaiya.

505
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:07,649
How much? - Thirty rupees, bhaiya. 30.

506
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,098
Thank you.

507
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:29,747
What is this?

508
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,916
Today is an auspicious day.

509
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,109
So, this is auspicious. - Oh, okay.

510
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,860
If you eat yogurt your nervousness will disappear.

511
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,446
You eat it too. You too are sitting for the exam.

512
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,770
Yes, oh! I too am sitting for the exam.

513
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,931
What do we do with this now? - I don't know.

514
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,328
Let's apply it on our hair.

515
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,589
It will make the hair lustrous. - Gross!

516
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:56,789
I'm joking.

517
00:31:57,051 --> 00:31:59,079
Didn't I tell you, I'm not that boring? - Yeah.

518
00:32:00,411 --> 00:32:01,457
Let's finish it. - Yeah.

519
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,749
"Long live love!"

520
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,749
"Long live love!"

521
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:20,749
"It is written..

522
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:22,601
..in red ink."

523
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,569
"My motives are rebellious."

524
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,749
"Look, now it's burning."

525
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,020
"And you ask me."

526
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:32,829
"Why I am upset?"

527
00:32:33,376 --> 00:32:40,588
"Things won't work your way anymore."

528
00:32:40,891 --> 00:32:42,563
"Say it."

529
00:32:42,643 --> 00:32:45,100
"Now and here."

530
00:32:45,248 --> 00:32:48,468
"Long live love."

531
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,869
"Long live love!"

532
00:32:58,349 --> 00:33:01,273
"Long live love!"

533
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,105
"My dreams..

534
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:14,240
..have united with dreams. Know that."

535
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:17,749
"My motives..

536
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:23,019
..have united with motives. Know that."

537
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,422
"Long live love!"

538
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:36,629
"Long live love!"

539
00:33:41,108 --> 00:33:44,039
"Long live love!"

540
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:51,509
"Long live love!"

541
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,058
"Long live love!"

542
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:02,516
Not IIT. I will sit for the SATs. I want to go to US.

543
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:07,235
Cornell, Yale, Harvard, Columbia. One of these.

544
00:34:07,565 --> 00:34:08,595
What?

545
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:12,188
My uncle is over there. He told me to come.

546
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,188
Then why are you working so hard over here?

547
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:20,079
For knowledge. Knowledge doesn't get wasted.

548
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:25,955
Uday, take me with you.

549
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:28,188
Nobody in this world stays put in one place.

550
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,188
What's the matter?

551
00:35:35,556 --> 00:35:39,589
I'm already eager for the results. - Yes.

552
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:42,789
It will take two weeks though. - Yes.

553
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,148
Okay, then. Bye.

554
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,079
Bye.

555
00:35:58,374 --> 00:35:59,238
See you.

556
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:04,460
Vartika. - Yes.

557
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:08,915
Yes.

558
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:14,429
Vartika you... you will go to bed early, won't you?

559
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:19,194
Peacefully. - Yes.

560
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:21,090
You too.

561
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:22,549
Yes. Me too.

562
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:28,116
Okay, then. Goodnight. - Goodnight.

563
00:36:28,465 --> 00:36:29,961
Stay in touch. - Yes.

564
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,989
Crap!

565
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:36,185
Vaibhav! - Vartika.

566
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,469
Can we begin the syllabus for the 12th?

567
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:42,589
Yes, we could do that.

568
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:43,789
Tomorrow. - Tomorrow.

569
00:36:44,248 --> 00:36:44,689
Cool.

570
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,834
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

571
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,006
Bye.

572
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:01,948
"I said, hey."

573
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,273
"If she agrees."

574
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:07,122
"If she sings a lullaby with her eyes."

575
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,529
"I will float into dreams."

576
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:10,852
"Stop me."

577
00:37:12,225 --> 00:37:13,589
"I said, hey."

578
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:15,589
"If she agrees to meet ..

579
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:17,941
and spends a few moments."

580
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:20,776
"I'll express my feelings."

581
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,589
"Please stop me."

582
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,548
"Oh please stop me."

583
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:33,629
"But please don't stop us..

584
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:39,332
..when we are lost in this manner..

585
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:45,046
..in our small world."

586
00:37:45,126 --> 00:37:50,806
"Why would you stop us?"

587
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:56,712
Sometimes in our busy lives we find love, love leaves us.

588
00:37:57,094 --> 00:37:58,349
or holds on forever.

589
00:37:58,696 --> 00:38:00,792
This romantic track to touch your hearts.

590
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:03,756
The seven wonders that are made in Kota are less.

591
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:07,806
You are the eighth wonder, my love.

592
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:10,716
Bye.

593
00:38:11,065 --> 00:38:14,044
Love you. Miss you. Take care.

594
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:20,349
This will last another six months.

595
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:25,922
Buddy, I should have studied.

596
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,810
A lot of time was wasted because I wanted to relax.

597
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,868
Even studies can be very relaxing, bro.

598
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,680
You just need the right partner.

599
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:47,328
"Can you imagine..

600
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:52,869
..when we are lost..

601
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:58,629
..in the stars."

602
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:04,045
"How would you find us?"

603
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:07,214
"I said, hey."

604
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,805
"If she agrees."

605
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:11,469
"If she sings a lullaby with her eyes."

606
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,745
"I will float into dreams."

607
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:15,468
"Stop me."
