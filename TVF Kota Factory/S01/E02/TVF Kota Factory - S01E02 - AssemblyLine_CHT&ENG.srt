1
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:29,031
嗨，媽媽
Hello, mummy.

2
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:30,621
怎麼樣，兒子？
How are you, son?

3
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:32,275
我很好
I am good.

4
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,123
學習進展如何？
How are studies going?

5
00:00:34,987 --> 00:00:36,071
一切都很順利
It's going well.

6
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:37,552
已經開始上課了
Classes have begun.

7
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,152
他的作息時間都亂套了
His routine will be disturbed.

8
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,446
讓他睡覺吧
Let him sleep.

9
00:00:43,914 --> 00:00:46,336
白天那麼長時間你不打電話，非要等晚上才打
You let the day pass and then call specifically at night.

10
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:48,941
告訴我
Tell me.

11
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:51,068
你心情怎麼樣？
Are you in good spirit?

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,169
還挺好的
Yes, mummy.

13
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:56,051
這個問題你已經問了無數次了
How do you manage to keep repeating the same question?

14
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:58,738
好吧
Okay.

15
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:00,629
那我就掛了
I'll hang up then.

16
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:02,228
好
Okay.

17
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:03,707
- 晚安-晚安
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

18
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,241
你是在裏麵改坐標嗎？
Are you revising 'coordinate' inside?

19
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,865
再給我點時間，兄弟
Just two more minutes, bro.

20
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,118
它會掉下來對吧？
Did it fall?

21
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:43,526
對不對？
Did it fall?

22
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,333
早就告訴過你們
Did I tell you or not?

23
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:53,872
傑圖·拜亞和物理學永遠不會出錯
Jeetu Bhaiya and Physics can never be wrong.

24
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:56,325
拜亞哥，再來一次
Bhaiya. Bhaiya. Once more.

25
00:01:56,598 --> 00:01:57,905
你交了幾次的錢？
How many times did you pay the fees?

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,281
我要是讓你再交一次錢呢？
What if I say 'once more'?

27
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,643
看，他在課堂上犯睏了
Look at that. He is feeling sleepy in class.

28
00:02:08,092 --> 00:02:09,828
我有那麼無聊嗎？
Am I that boring?

29
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:12,511
我淩晨4:30偷了別人的車
I stole someone's wheel at 4:30 AM.

30
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,093
他隨時都可能來找我
He may show up anytime.

31
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:15,758
然而這家夥居然睏了
And this chap is all sleepy.

32
00:02:16,465 --> 00:02:17,484
對不起，老師
Sorry, sir.

33
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:19,972
- 我整晚都睡不著，所以...-你剛才說什麼? 再說一遍？
- I could not sleep all night, so.. - What did you just say? Come again?

34
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,138
- 我整晚都睡不著...-不是這句，再往前一句
- I could not sleep all night.. - No. No. Before that?

35
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:27,470
對不起，老師
Sorry, sir.

36
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:29,300
老師！
Sir!

37
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,452
大家都聽到了嗎？
Did everyone hear that?

38
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:33,812
他管我叫老師
Sir.

39
00:02:34,312 --> 00:02:36,577
傑圖·拜亞已經不是拜亞哥了
Jeetu Bhaiya is no longer a 'Bhaiya' (brother).

40
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,936
我現在是什麼？
What am I now?

41
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,763
老師！
Sir!

42
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:43,047
不是隻有巴特拉和饒才能叫老師
Batla sir and Rao sir aren't the only sirs.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,013
現在我也能稱什麼……
Even Jeetu Bhaiya is now a..

44
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:46,533
老師！
Sir!

45
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:47,521
來，我應該給你點獎勵
You surely deserve a prize.

46
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,813
- 過來-快去
- Come over. - Go. Go

47
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:50,846
- 來吧-幹得漂亮
- Come. - Well done!

48
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:54,914
我的成功要歸功於我母親
The credit for my success goes to my mother Mrs.

49
00:02:55,366 --> 00:02:57,186
蘇米特拉
Sumitra..

50
00:02:58,863 --> 00:03:01,055
快去! 去洗洗臉，快去！
Scoot! Go and wash your face. Go!

51
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,763
他想拿走我辛辛苦苦掙來的錢
He wants to take my hard earned money.

52
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:08,257
- 你翻臉太快了，拜亞哥 -有什麼問題嗎？
- You are so dramatic, Bhaiya. - Why shouldn't I be?

53
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:11,524
我這個哈拉格佈爾戲劇協會的總管可不是白當的
I wasn't the Governor of Dramatics society IIT Kharagpur for nothing.

54
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:14,103
讓我們繼續
Let's resume.

55
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,916
-話說有一個漂亮小姐姐 -好的，老師
- A beautiful damsel. - Yes, sir.

56
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:20,534
一說到小姐姐你們就都精神了
Yes! Now you're all awake.. at the mention of 'damsel'.

57
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,259
- 餡餅新鮮嗎?-當然
- Are the patties fresh, brother? - Certainly.

58
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:01,882
給我來一個
Give me one.

59
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:30,953
你怎麼不吃飯，吃餡餅？
You are foregoing food for patties?

60
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,377
這哪是飯，這是垃圾！
It is not food. It is bullcrap!

61
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,482
離家才一個星期你就滿嘴髒話了
Just a week away from home and you've turned foul-mouthed.

62
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:38,844
垃圾又不是髒話
Bullcrap is not a cuss word.

63
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,489
你就把這當作是身體的必需品
It's a body product.

64
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,717
肥料
Fertilizer.

65
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:43,638
阿加瓦爾先生曾經在課堂上也說這個詞
Agarwal sir used to utter it even in classroom.

66
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,939
給我來點泡菜
Give me pickle.

67
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,852
你們繼續
Carry on.

68
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:49,024
烏代，阿加瓦爾先生課上還說要刻苦學習、高度自律
Uday, rather than learning hard work, discipline..

69
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,543
你怎麼就不學點好的
..and punctuality, you choose to learn cuss words from Agarwal sir.

70
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,491
還有你...都吃好幾天餡餅了
And you... Munching patties all the time.

71
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,471
如果你再不好好吃飯，肯定會變得更虛弱
You'll grow weaker if you skip meals.

72
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:57,193
如果你變得虛弱，你就會生病
If you grow weak you fall ill.

73
00:04:57,414 --> 00:04:59,389
第一周內生病的孩子
And the children who fall ill within the first week..

74
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:01,199
會被父母帶回家
..are taken back home by their parents.

75
00:05:01,786 --> 00:05:03,613
從此與印度理工無緣
And they never make it to IIT.

76
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:07,149
米納，我就算吃了這些東西，我也會生病的
Meena, I will fall ill even if I eat this food.

77
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,291
這菜太油膩了
This is so oily.

78
00:05:09,646 --> 00:05:11,689
-這是把賣油的打死了吧?-小聲點
- Is oil free or what? - Speak softly.

79
00:05:12,132 --> 00:05:15,104
如果被錢德魯聽到，我們晚餐就隻能吃拌蔬菜了
If Chandru hears then we'll get mixed vegetables of all the gourds for dinner.

80
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:16,206
裏麵還有苦瓜
Including bitter gourd.

81
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:21,354
你還喝上酒了？
Still drinking Bisleri?

82
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,650
米納，這是百歲山，不是牛欄山
Meena. Not Bisleri. Aquafina.

83
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,428
都差不多
It's all the Bisleri's are the same.

84
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,650
你為什麼要浪費錢喝這麼貴的水？
Why are you squandering money? Drink this.

85
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,737
水是無辜的
The mess does not make the water.

86
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:32,741
這的水都不解渴
My thirst doesn't get quenched by this water.

87
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,828
還有點鹹
It is salty.

88
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,125
- 昌巴爾的水質... 很硬-很硬
- The Chambal water.. Is hard. - Is hard.

89
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:38,382
我知道
I know.

90
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,678
過去一周我都聽到無數次了
I've been hearing this for the past week.

91
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,325
聽著，如果你吃得不好，你就不能集中註意力
Look, if you don't eat well you won't be able to concentrate.

92
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:49,375
這樣你就不能長時間學習了
Then you won't be able to study long.

93
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:53,127
你現在的問題已經夠多了，為什麼還要自找麻煩
As it is you are facing so many complexities why invite a new one.

94
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:55,690
聽著，如果你一直喝這個，你就會浪費很多錢
Look, if you drink more of this you will spend more money..

95
00:05:55,905 --> 00:05:57,544
如果水喝的少，你就會便秘
..if you drink less you will be constipated.

96
00:05:58,645 --> 00:06:00,284
我已經便秘了
I already am.

97
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:04,873
你今天還是冇拉出來嗎？
You couldn't empty your bowels even today?

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,522
兄弟，我這吃飯呢，聊這個合適嗎？
What kind of conversation is this for the dining table?

99
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:12,684
你剛才不是還說飯是身體的肥料
Wonderful! When you called this delicious food a body product..

100
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:14,300
你怎麼不考慮合適不合適？
..was the conversation good then!?

101
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,085
還是拉不出來嗎？
You couldn't empty your bowels?

102
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:27,974
你要幫他拉嗎？
Are you going empty it for him?

103
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:26,950
烏代！
Uday!

104
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,907
我們去喝點茶吧
Let's go for some tea.

105
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:29,069
來吧，寶貝！
Come. Oh, Shivangi!

106
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:31,902
你咬得太狠了
You bite so hard.

107
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:34,662
調皮！
Raunchy!

108
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,988
米納
Meena.

109
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,030
我們去喝杯茶吧
Let's go for a tea.

110
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,357
現在還不到5:30
It isn't 5:30 as yet.

111
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,354
你做完這套題了嗎？
Have you finished the sheet?

112
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:50,666
是的，我做到第35題了
Yes, I've completed up to 35.

113
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,668
你完成了35個？
You completed 35?

114
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,954
你做得好快，我還在做第30題
You did it very fast. I am still on the 30th.

115
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,125
你怎麼不一口氣做完呢?五點半之前要做完
Why don't you complete it? It will be done by 5:30.

116
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:20,123
你們怎麼能坐這麼久？
How do you guys manage to sit for so long?

117
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,549
我坐一會就纍了
I get tired in a little while.

118
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,256
別這麼說
Don't say that.

119
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,833
昨天你作業都冇做完
Even yesterday you didn't finish the homework.

120
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:28,415
如果你今天也不做完，那一定會越積越多
If you leave it today as well, it's bound to pile up.

121
00:08:30,695 --> 00:08:32,143
我做不到
I am not up to it.

122
00:08:33,506 --> 00:08:36,092
好好思考一下怎麼合理利用時間
Then try to read the theory. Utilize your time.

123
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:38,909
我現在不想思考
I don't feel like it now.

124
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,060
這就是我一直想跟你說的
This is what I've been trying to explain to you for so long.

125
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:44,448
你知道嗎
You know what.

126
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:47,185
讀讀《火烈鳥》
Read Flamingo for now.

127
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,906
這是一本輕鬆的讀物，能讓為你為考試做好準備
It's a light read and will prepare you for boards too.

128
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,074
拿著
Take it.

129
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,036
裏麵有很多故事
It contains stories.

130
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:04,135
一隻猴子正在通過滑輪拉下一個物體
A monkey is pulling down an object through a pulley.

131
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:09,892
另一隻猴子正在拉第一隻猴子的尾巴
Another monkey is pulling the first monkey's tail.

132
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,793
因為它在拉它的尾巴，所以必然會産生緊張的氣氛
Since it is pulling his tail it is bound to create tension.

133
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,998
瓦伊巴夫！
Vaibhav!

134
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:28,383
瓦伊巴夫！
Vaibhav!

135
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,875
你的狀態在我看來完全不對勁
Your symptoms do not appear right to me at all.

136
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,718
你需要一個聰明人的指導
You need the guidance of someone wise.

137
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,829
- 誰?-心理谘詢師
- Who? - A counselor.

138
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,036
心理醫生？
Psychiatrist?

139
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,009
谘詢師? 見鬼去吧！
Counselor? Like hell!

140
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:51,693
我是精神病嗎? 我抑鬱嗎？
Is this a mental problem? Am I depressed?

141
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,486
我有焦慮癥嗎? 我有自殺傾嚮嗎？
Do I have anxiety? Am I suicidal?

142
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:55,705
我看起來像是個需要看心理醫生的人嗎？
Have I lost my mind that I need a counselor?

143
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,685
不管怎樣，這裏一多半的谘詢師都是騙子
And anyways, half the counselors here are frauds.

144
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:03,615
我才不需要谘詢師
I don't need anybody.

145
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:08,084
你需要阿普唑侖，能提升你的睡眠質量
You need Alprozolam, which is good for your sleep..

146
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:11,558
可以恢複你體內血清素和多巴胺的平衡
..and can restore the balance of serotonin and dopamine in your body.

147
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,599
乳果糖可以緩解你的便秘問題
And Lactulose for your constipation problems.

148
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,691
門口交費
Pay the fees outside.

149
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:20,599
你知道你不是醫生吧？
You do know that you are not a Doctor, right?

150
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:23,866
就因為我穿的實驗服而不是白大褂
Just because I wore a coat instead of an apron..

151
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:25,720
還有我的字寫得不好，就能說明我不是醫生嗎？
..and my handwriting is not good, does it mean I am not a Doctor?

152
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,964
因為你冇有執照
Because you don't have a license.

153
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,692
你為什麼穿著這件實驗服？
Why have you worn this lab coat?

154
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:31,581
穿什麼
Don't dress for the job you have.

155
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,042
就是什麼
Dress for the job you want.

156
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:35,495
瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

157
00:10:35,822 --> 00:10:37,256
我知道你需要什麼了
I know what you need.

158
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,038
克利須那神廟
Radha Krishna temple.

159
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:50,165
神會聽到你的許願
All your prayers are answered over here.

160
00:10:50,245 --> 00:10:51,000
拿著這個
Take this.

161
00:10:51,155 --> 00:10:53,009
用你最真誠的心寫下你的願望
Write it nicely with a clean heart.

162
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:56,412
從數學的角度來講這是不可能的，米納
It is mathematically impossible, Meena.

163
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:01,653
印度理工學院的座位遠不如來這許願的人多
There aren't as many seats in IIT as the number of prayers here.

164
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:03,657
搞毛線啊，米納？
What is this, Meena?

165
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,290
你為什麼要把我們帶到這裏來？
Why did you have to bring us here?

166
00:11:06,236 --> 00:11:07,420
上帝保佑
Help me.

167
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:09,125
你瘋了嗎？
Are you crazy?

168
00:11:14,396 --> 00:11:15,558
這是很有必要的
It was needed.

169
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,289
來自一個所愛的人，而不是外人
But not from anybody. A loved one.

170
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:22,161
一個能夠感同身受的人，一個親身經曆過這一切的人
Someone who would empathize. Someone who has faced this himself.

171
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,880
他跟我說起過你，所以我才帶他來這兒
So, he told me about you. That's why I brought him here.

172
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,501
我來對地方了，不是嗎？
Did the right thing, didn't I?

173
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:29,806
當然
Absolutely.

174
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,978
你確實很聰明
You certainly are wise.

175
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:33,689
當然了，他在馬赫什瓦裏教育
Ofcouse, he is in Maheshwari.

176
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:35,915
皮尤什
Piyush.

177
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,502
快告訴我你是怎麼做到的，兄弟
You tell me how you managed, bro.

178
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:43,500
我現在吃不好，睡不好，還便秘
My food, drink, potty and sleep, everything is out of order.

179
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,067
你怎麼知道我的地址的？
How did you get my address?

180
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,246
從你的父母那裏
From your parents..

181
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,083
因為你不接我電話
..because you weren't answering my phone.

182
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:52,931
很聰明，對吧？
Smart, right?

183
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:53,971
這也是我的主意
Again, my idea.

184
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:56,194
非常好
Very nice.

185
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,223
我不會佔用你太多時間
I won't take up much of your time.

186
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,531
我能理解馬赫什瓦裏壓力很大
I understand the pressure from Maheshwari.

187
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,273
跟我分享一下你的應對機製吧
Just share with me any coping mechanism.

188
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,332
我實在受不了了
I am not able to handle it.

189
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:09,711
患難見真情，對吧？
A friend in need is a friend indeed, right?

190
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:11,397
對吧，兄弟？
Isn't that right, brother?

191
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:19,204
你真是來對地方了
You did the right thing coming here?

192
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,107
難道不是嗎？
Ain't that true?

193
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:21,444
謝謝你
Thank you.

194
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,021
太對了
You did the right thing..

195
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:26,550
因為我也受不了了
..because even I am unable to handle it.

196
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,807
看來皮尤什也便秘了
It seems even Piyush is constipated.

197
00:12:32,306 --> 00:12:34,029
不是一回事，兄弟
This is something else, Meena.

198
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,185
怎麼了，兄弟？
What's the matter, bro?

199
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,611
我不在馬赫什瓦裏
I am not in Maheshwari.

200
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:41,106
在過去的六個月裏，我一直在上私教
I've been taking individual lessons for the past six months.

201
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:43,071
我的猜測是對的，米納
My suspicion turned out right, Meena.

202
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,251
我跟你說過
Didn't I tell you,

203
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:47,559
為什麼一個‘馬赫什瓦裏’的學生會住在塔萬迪薩博，而不是維根納加爾
what is a 'Maheshwari' boy doing in Talwandi instead of Vigyan Nagar.

204
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:48,322
我不明白
I don't understand.

205
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,314
你在說什麼？
What are you saying?

206
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:52,933
我爸是托關係才給我送進馬赫什瓦裏的
Dad got me admitted using influence..

207
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,820
但是第一次考試之後我就被排到後麵的分組了
..but when the batch was shuffled after the first test..

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,552
最後一組
..I ended up in the last batch.

209
00:12:58,107 --> 00:13:00,665
第二次考試我又是最後一組的倒數第一
The next time I was the last student in that batch as well.

210
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,389
然後我不得不退學，選擇上私教
Then I had to leave Maheshwari and opt for individual coaching.

211
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,329
我明白了
I see.

212
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,665
這就是你不回我電話的原因，你這個無賴
That's why you wouldn't return my calls, you rascal.

213
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,245
- 對不起，兄弟 - 滾蛋
- So sorry, brother. - Get lost!

214
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:15,910
你要我怎麼開口？
How could I tell you?

215
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:17,759
爸爸在老家到處吹噓
Dad has bragged all over Itarsi..

216
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,171
我在馬赫什瓦裏教育
..that I am in Maheshwari.

217
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,919
是啊
Ya.

218
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,336
他確實愛吹牛
He does brag alot.

219
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,194
他在老家跟所有人說我冇被馬赫什瓦裏錄取
He told all of Itarsi that I didn't get admitted to Maheshwari.

220
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:28,667
老家親戚朋友都認為我一定能考上印度理工
All of Itarsi feels I will surely get admitted to IIT.

221
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:30,554
是的，我們都有這種感覺
Yes. All of us feel that way.

222
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:31,099
是的
Yes.

223
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,720
我還很納悶他的成績是怎麼突然飆上來的
I was baffled as to how he soared so suddenly.

224
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,505
我希望你的家人知道
I hope your family knows.

225
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:39,656
- 不行，兄弟 - 不行？
- No, buddy. - No?

226
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:42,182
上次我回家的時候
Last time when I went home for Diwali..

227
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:45,298
我本來打算把一切都說出來，結束這件事，但是……
..I had planned on disclosing everything and end the matter but..

228
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,050
但是？
But?

229
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:52,841
這是我有生以來第一次接到尼哈打來的電話
For the first time in my life Neha called.

230
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:53,805
尼哈 · 普羅希特？
Neha Purohit?

231
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:55,482
是的，你認識她的妹妹
Yes. You know her younger sister.

232
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,043
- 希爾帕?-是的
- Shilpa? - Yes.

233
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,058
她也想考印度理工學院，需要我的建議
She was thinking of IIT herself and needed tips from me.

234
00:14:00,268 --> 00:14:01,143
所以他們兩個都來了我家
So both of them came to my place.

235
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,178
尼哈和希爾帕？
Both Neha and Shilpa?

236
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,016
- 是的-還有他們的媽媽也來了
- Yes. - Their mom came too.

237
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,566
- 迪莎阿姨?-是的
- Aunt Disha? - Yes.

238
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,656
這是我有生以來第一次得到如此多的認可
For the first time in my life I got so much recognition..

239
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:09,966
我怎麼能就這麼算了呢？
..how could I have let it go?

240
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:14,007
還有，你知道嗎，在談話中
Also, do you know, during the conversation..

241
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,991
阿姨還跟我確認了我的出生日期和時間
..aunt confirmed my time and date of birth.

242
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,843
我也在為印度理工學院做準備啊
Even I am preparing for IIT.

243
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,823
我在學校成績還比你好
I was a better student than you in school.

244
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,001
她怎麼不來找我要建議
She never asked me for tips.

245
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:26,526
因為你在神童教育
You are studying in Prodigy.

246
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,478
先不說那些了，快幫我想想辦法
Never mind all of that. Tell me what I should do.

247
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,414
你啊
You..

248
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,033
最好去看看心理醫生
..better see a counselor.

249
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:11,814
餵，媽媽
Yes, mummy.

250
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,152
你在幹什麼？
What were you doing?

251
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,242
冇什麼，我在學習
Nothing. Was studying when..

252
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:17,540
然後一位無所事事的女士打擾了我
..an idle lady disturbed me.

253
00:15:18,922 --> 00:15:19,608
她怎麼能這麼做？
How could she do that?

254
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:25,082
在你學習的時候你要跟你房東說清楚，不要來打擾……
Make it clear to your landlady when you are studying she..

255
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,473
我知道了
I got it.

256
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:32,596
我掛了，你繼續學習吧
I'll hang up. You continue studying.

257
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:37,489
你心情怎麼樣？
Are you in a good spirit?

258
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:39,352
可好了，放心吧
Yes, mummy. I am.

259
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,528
除非我明確告訴你，否則就不要自己亂猜
Until I categorically tell you never assume otherwise.

260
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:45,613
好吧，晚安
Well, goodnight.

261
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:47,959
晚安
Goodnight.

262
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:05,229
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

263
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,125
“我冇做這道題，因為我看不懂”
"I didn't attempt the problem as I didn't understand it."

264
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:11,189
一定要尋找線索，題幹裏麵給出了很多線索
Always look for hints, so many are there.

265
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:14,540
在哪呢？
Where?

266
00:16:16,297 --> 00:16:18,671
第一個提示就是這道題是人出的
The first hint is that the problem is given.

267
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,545
當出題者嚮我們提出問題時
When the maker has posed the problem to us..

268
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,431
這就意味著利用我們現有的知識是可以解決的
..that means it's solvable with our knowledge.

269
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,348
另外速度也給了
Secondly the velocity is given.

270
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:27,334
看到了吧，是不是？
See. Is it or isn't it?

271
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:28,776
那麼速度隻有在兩種情況下會用到
So, it will be used in either of the two things.

272
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,233
能量或動量
Energy or momentum.

273
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,537
現在你要決定賭一把
Now you have to decide which gamble to take.

274
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:35,896
如果你還是冇看懂，那麼繼續尋找線索
If it still doesn't make sense then keep looking for hints.

275
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,857
“摩擦”這個詞看到了嗎？
Is the word 'friction' visible?

276
00:16:40,556 --> 00:16:41,362
是的
Yes.

277
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:42,641
這意味著不是能量
It means energy cannot be used.

278
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,851
那還剩什麼了? 動量守恆
What does that leave? Conservation of momentum.

279
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,774
初始值等於最終值
Initial equal to final.

280
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:50,182
回答是或不是
Say yes or no.

281
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:51,315
是的
Yes, sir.

282
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:53,273
隻需要把初始值和最終值等同起來
Just equate initial to final.

283
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,265
打勾然後看下一題
Tick it and move on.

284
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:56,807
在未來的某個時刻，可能在你開心的唱歌時
At some point in the future whilst laughing, singing..

285
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,711
或者在上廁所時，你就會意識到 
..or in toilet you will realize..

286
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,667
為什麼動量是守恆的
..why was the momentum conserved.

287
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:02,275
好嗎？
Okay?

288
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,636
即使你不理解這個問題，你也要解題
Even if you don't understand the question jostle with it.

289
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:05,548
你是做什麼的？
What do you do?

290
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:06,622
解題的
Jostle with it.

291
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:07,828
是的
Yes.

292
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,202
一旦你學會了解題和轉筆
Once you have learned to jostle with questions and twirl the pen...

293
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:11,588
你就已經是半個理工學院人了
..you are already half an IITian.

294
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,684
來吧下一題
Come on. Next.

295
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,865
你要去哪，剩下的題你不做了嗎？
Hello, bro. Didn't you do the rest?

296
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,843
老師，我隻做到了52題
Sir, I only did up to number 52.

297
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,548
我明白了，你做了52道題，非常棒！
I see. You completed 52. Very good!

298
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:31,765
我這人就是不愛護環境
It's me who hates the environment.

299
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,635
我印150道題就是為了浪費紙，對吧？
I made a 150 page long sheet just to waste paper, right?

300
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:39,695
不是我不能解題
Sir, Not that I can't crack problems..

301
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,592
而是我坐不住闆凳
..but I am unable to sit for long.

302
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,112
我心情不好
I'm not in the right spirit.

303
00:17:45,192 --> 00:17:46,675
這是真的嗎，還是另有隱情？
Is this the problem or there's more to it?

304
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,292
拜亞哥，他來了之後吃不好
Bhaiya, he doesn't even eat well.

305
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,276
他靠吃餡餅生存
He survives on Maggi and patties.

306
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:54,281
他每天喝礦泉水，甚至都不怎麼睡覺
He still drinks Bisleri water and doesn't even sleep.

307
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:01,091
真的嗎？
Why, brother?

308
00:18:02,433 --> 00:18:03,327
是的，拜亞哥
Yes, Bhaiya.

309
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,085
你來的比別人晚
You came late.

310
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,323
所以錯過了迎新會
So he missed the orientation.

311
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,026
他不知道在科塔生活的兩個重要概念
He does not know the two important concepts of living in Kota.

312
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:11,862
告訴他，米娜爾
Tell him, Meenal.

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,792
兩個什麼概念？
What are they?

314
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:16,583
首先，傑圖·拜亞不是我們的物理教員
Firstly, Jeetu Bhaiya is not our physics faculty.

315
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:17,876
他是我們的知心姐姐
He is our agony aunt.

316
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,880
能解決各種各樣的問題
He solves all kinds of problems.

317
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,541
學術問題，非學術問題，個人問題，經濟問題或者感情問題
Academic, non-academic, personal, financial or romantic.

318
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,106
即使你半夜喝多了
Even if your landlord has kicked you out of the house..

319
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:31,375
被房東趕出來
..in the middle of the night or if you've argued with the mess people..

320
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:34,048
或者是被警察抓到你看黃色雜誌
..or if a Policeman has caught you reading obscene literature.

321
00:18:34,385 --> 00:18:36,559
傑圖·拜亞都能解決
Jeetu Bhaiya solves everything.

322
00:18:36,877 --> 00:18:40,646
隻要給他打電話，傑圖·拜亞就能幫助你
Just call him immediately and Jeetu Bhaiya solves all the problems.

323
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:44,414
還有
And..

324
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,226
第二個？
..the second?

325
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:48,594
你忘了第二個？
You forgot the second?

326
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,052
是的
Yes.

327
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,872
"每個孩子都是特別的"
Every child is special.

328
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,990
這完全是胡說八道
That is utter nonsense.

329
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,965
你不是什麼獨一無二的人
You are not some unique personality.

330
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,174
你遇到的問題每年都會發生在成仟上萬的學生身上
These problems occur to thousands of students each year.

331
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:03,901
在準備去理工學院生活之前，你必須學會在科塔生存
Before preparing for IIT at Kota one must prepare themselves to live in Kota.

332
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:05,885
有很多簡單的方法可以做到
And there are simple ways to do it.

333
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,683
如果你遇到問題
If you encounter problems..

334
00:19:08,829 --> 00:19:09,532
解決問題
Jostle with them.

335
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:10,427
解決問題
Jostle with them.

336
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,495
即使你不喜歡這裏的水，也要喝
Even if you don't like the water, Just drink it.

337
00:19:12,743 --> 00:19:14,696
即使你不喜歡這些亂七八糟的食物，也要吃
Even if you don't like the mess food, Just eat it.

338
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,273
即使你不能長時間地坐著，也要一直坐著
Even if you are unable to sit for long Just sit for long.

339
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:18,668
挑戰你自己，我會坐很久
Challenge yourself. I will sit for long.

340
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,594
我根本起不來
I won't get up at all.

341
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:22,060
我要解題，我要讀書
I will solve problems. I will read theories.

342
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,707
我要看講座
I will watch Unacademy's lessons.

343
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,249
我要複習以前的錯題
I will go through old papers.

344
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,728
我會睡覺，我會死，但我就是不會站起來
I will sleep, I will die but I won't get up.

345
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,160
這樣的話，你做到了什麼？
So, what have you done?

346
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,096
你已經把你遇到的問題轉化為勇氣
You have turned your problems to dare.

347
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,264
而勇氣則與自我直接相關
And dare is directly connected to ego.

348
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,422
自我有許多缺點，但它也有優點
Ego has many disadvantages but it has one advantage too.

349
00:19:37,047 --> 00:19:38,035
事情似乎是可行的
Things seem to be doable.

350
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,586
你不必長時間強迫自己去做這些事情
And you don't have to do this drama for long.

351
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,290
多少天？
How many days?

352
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,406
21天
21 days.

353
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:45,324
你可以在21天內養成或放棄任何習慣
You can form any or give up any habit in 21 days.

354
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,254
我以前抽煙很兇
I had a smoking problem.

355
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:49,243
一天兩包
2 packs a day.

356
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,558
我戒掉了
I lost it.

357
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:53,543
戒煙之後我就在家裏炫耀
I left it one day and after that I bragged about it at home..

358
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:56,496
給我的女朋友，同事，司機和司機的妻子炫耀
..to my girlfriend, faculty, driver and the driver's wife.

359
00:19:56,687 --> 00:20:00,082
因此，我給了那個小販2000盧比
So much so, I gave 2000 rupees to the vendor..

360
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:01,601
不要把煙賣給我
..not to give me cigarettes to smoke.

361
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:05,850
如果你嚮全世界吹噓，那麼世界就不會讓你吸煙
If you brag about it to the world then the world won't let you smoke.

362
00:20:06,478 --> 00:20:09,125
剛開始戒煙的時候我很難受，很想抽煙
I felt a little urge in the beginning and then some more.

363
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,327
但是過了21天，這種欲望就冇有了
By the time 21 days had passed the urge was zero.

364
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:12,822
這就是你必須做的
That's what you have to do.

365
00:20:14,158 --> 00:20:16,158
說點什麼，是或不是
Say something. Yes or no.

366
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:18,263
是的，拜亞哥
Yes, Bhaiya.

367
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,445
烏代是個討厭的家夥
Uday is a nasty fella..

368
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:25,336
但是米納，你明知道你的朋友會這樣
..but Meena, you knew this was happening with your friend..

369
00:20:25,917 --> 00:20:27,243
但你還是冇告訴他？
..and still didn't tell him?

370
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,234
拜亞哥，我……
Bhaiya, I..

371
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:30,952
你也一樣，佈魯圖斯
You too, Brutus.

372
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:32,956
你也一樣
You too.

373
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:36,566
你註意到了嗎？
Did you notice?

374
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:38,633
拜亞哥叫我佈魯圖斯，‘佈魯圖斯·米納’
Bhaiya called me Brutus. 'Brutus Meena'

375
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:43,678
幹嘛? 你冇有一點幽默感嗎？
What? Don't you have any sense of humour?

376
00:20:54,845 --> 00:20:57,629
我很醜，但是我很溫柔
I might look nasty but not from the heart.

377
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,558
當然，我是比哈爾猛虎的成員
Sure, I'm a member of the Bihar Tigers.

378
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:02,677
我肩負著整個城市和平
I have the responsibility of the entire city on these shoulders.

379
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,690
但是烏代 · 古普塔絕不會忽視他的朋友
But Uday Gupta never ignores his sidekicks.

380
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:09,853
因為你哥我是街頭之王
..because your brother is the king of the streets.

381
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,613
我已經開啓了'非學術'的年度訂閱
I have taken the annual subscription for Unacademy plus.

382
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,436
給你開的
For you.

383
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:17,650
去吧，想聽多少講座就聽多少
Go. Attend as many live lectures as you wish.

384
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:21,877
永遠記住，你的兄弟是我，不是佈魯圖斯
And always remember. Your brother is Caesar, not Brutus.

385
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,090
他下午三點才起床
This man rises up at 3 pm.

386
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,395
但是你不要起來，去學習
But don't you rise. Go study.

387
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,404
你在看什麼? 快去學習
What are you looking at? Go study.

388
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,033
人不會討厭他看不見的東西
One cannot hate what one does not see.

389
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:44,386
完全不要看那些亂七八糟的食物
Don't look at the mess food at all.

390
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:46,308
不慌不忙地撕一塊麵包
Pick up bread without a fuss.

391
00:21:47,123 --> 00:21:49,811
隨便蘸點什麼，嚼嚼就行了
Dip it in whatever and just chew.

392
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:52,272
有時你可能會忍不住下看
Sometimes you may be tempted to look down..

393
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,101
但這就是你的失敗之處
..but therein lies your defeat.

394
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:07,015
今天味道好多了
Tastes even better today.

395
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:17,501
不要喝常溫的水
Don't drink water at room temperature.

396
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,293
喝冰箱裏的冷水
Drink chilled water of the fridge.

397
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:21,600
人們甚至覺得冰鎮啤酒都好喝
People even savour beer if chilled.

398
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,158
鹽水算不了什麼
Salt water is nothing.

399
00:22:24,283 --> 00:22:25,256
幹杯
Bottoms up.

400
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:29,621
這裏的 x 錶示塊的距離
Here x is given as the distance of the block..

401
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,385
我們必須找到速度作為 x 的函數
..and we have to find the velocity as a function of x.

402
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:36,099
隻要選擇正確的選項
Just choose the correct option.

403
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,441
C.
C.

404
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:39,113
你什麼時候來的？
When did you come?

405
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,194
我來看看你
I came to check on you.

406
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:41,799
很好! 很好！
Good! Good!

407
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:45,732
如果你選擇了 c 選項，那麼你的答案是正確的
If you have chosen C option then your answer is correct.

408
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,304
現在我來告訴你這個問題的解決辦法
Now I shall tell you the solution of this question.

409
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:49,944
是的，我吃過了
Yes, I have eaten.

410
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:51,733
我很好，精神也很好
I am all well and am in good spirits.

411
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,010
媽媽，你怎麼能每天都問我同樣的問題呢？
Mummy, how do you manage to keep repeating the same question everyday?

412
00:22:57,423 --> 00:22:58,514
好吧
Okay.

413
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:06,385
再用點力，兄弟
Apply more pressure, bro.

414
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,447
瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

415
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:14,784
有用嗎？
Is it working?

416
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,956
扁豆湯，蔬菜和麵包都準備好
Lentil soup, veggies and breads have to be prepared..

417
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,543
所以總會有一個錯誤範圍
..so there is always a scope of mistake.

418
00:23:20,322 --> 00:23:22,602
在這樣的範圍內，廚師們肯定會犯錯誤
Given the scope, the cooks in the mess ensure mistakes.

419
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,944
這就是為什麼一個人應該更喜歡吃自己不做的東西
That's why one should prefer eating what they don't make..

420
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:29,851
例如沙拉，泡菜，薄餅，酸奶和糖
..such as salad, pickle, papad, yogurt and sugar.

421
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,191
這樣你的套餐就做好了
And there is your three course meal.

422
00:23:51,781 --> 00:23:53,654
我治好了很多人的便秘
I have helped many people crap.

423
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,018
你的也一樣
Yours is no different.

424
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:57,090
兩口
Two puffs.

425
00:23:57,284 --> 00:23:58,316
隻要兩口
Only two puffs.

426
00:23:58,635 --> 00:24:00,672
你就能體驗到飛一般的感覺
You will experience streamline motion.

427
00:24:00,752 --> 00:24:01,628
完全冇有摩擦力
Not friction.

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,572
胡說八道
Nonsense.

429
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,773
-拿著，這是“真相”-滾開! 該死的癮君子！
Take it. This is 'the truth'. -Scram! Bloody addict!

430
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:19,431
孩子們，今天我們要解決一個關於垂直圓周運動的問題
Children, today we shall solve a problem on vertical circular motion.

431
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,548
讓我先給你解釋一下這個問題
Let me first explain the problem to you.

432
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:22,848
瓦伊巴夫
Vaibhav.

433
00:24:23,012 --> 00:24:23,746
房東阿姨
Aunty.

434
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,501
她走下樓梯時摔倒了
She was walking down the stairs and fell.

435
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:26,832
口吐白沫
She is frothing in the mouth.

436
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:27,700
你好，我需要救護車
Hello. Ambulance.

437
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,203
快來拉爾 · 伯奇酒店，非常緊急
Come to Lal Burj quickly. It's an emergency.

438
00:24:29,345 --> 00:24:30,869
什麼? 泡沫? 哪裏？
What? Froth? Where?

439
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:33,789
這就起來了？
You got up?

440
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:35,539
為了那個老巫婆？
For that two-bit woman?

441
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:37,176
你隻是想找個理由站起來
You just want an excuse.

442
00:24:37,256 --> 00:24:38,465
去你的吧！
Damn you!

443
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,565
你會在拜亞哥麵前給我們帶來恥辱
You will bring disgrace on us in Jeetu Bhaiya's presence.

444
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,543
把賭註裏的100盧比給我
Give me my 100 rupees from the bet.

445
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:46,622
工程師
Engineer.

446
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:48,414
大自然已經完成了一半的工作
Nature has done half the job.

447
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:49,362
水含有鹽分
Water contains salt.

448
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,747
隻要加鹽和檸檬就行了
Just add salt and lemon to it.

449
00:24:50,827 --> 00:24:51,710
這樣檸檬水就做好了
Lemonade is ready.

450
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:56,135
這個小知識每年拯救一仟萬兒童的生命
This small tip saves ten million children's lives every year.

451
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,714
太棒了！
It's great!

452
00:24:57,838 --> 00:24:58,607
不是嗎？
Isn't it?

453
00:24:58,827 --> 00:24:59,861
現在去拿兩個杯子
Go and prepare two glasses now.

454
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:01,184
三個
Three.

455
00:25:01,986 --> 00:25:06,893
媽媽，烏代的女朋友給烏代打電話的次數，遠冇有你給我打電話的次數多
Mummy, Uday's girlfriend does not call him as many times as you call me.

456
00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:09,647
走! 走! 走! 快點！
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

457
00:25:09,727 --> 00:25:11,046
幹得好，兄弟! 幹得好！
Well done, bro! Well done!

458
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:12,822
你就快進入印度理工了，加油
You are under the oath of IIT.

459
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:14,860
如果連一天都堅持不下來，那還怎麼看闆球比賽？
One can't follow one days, how will one follow test cricket?

460
00:25:15,037 --> 00:25:19,073
T-20版本是專為科塔學生設計的
The T-20 format has been created for Kota students.

461
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,281
IPL（印度超級闆球聯賽）是未來的趨勢
IPL is the future.

462
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,893
要是他們能讓尤弗拉伊上場就好了
If only they would take Yuvraj to play.

463
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:25,438
那就大錯特錯了
It's very wrong of them.

464
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:27,945
你說得對，兄弟，這都是政治手段
You are correct, bro. It's all politics.

465
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:31,738
兄弟，尤維可以，絕對行
Bro, Yuvi can and Yuvi will.

466
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:33,902
冇錯，兄弟，尤弗拉伊會回來的
That's right, bro. Yuvraj will return.

467
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,954
記住我說的話
You can quote me on that.

468
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,813
你覺得呢？
You?

469
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:38,793
是的
Yes.

470
00:25:39,624 --> 00:25:40,897
他會回來的
He will return.

471
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:45,784
孩子們，今天我們要解決一個關於沖量動量定理的問題
Children, today we shall solve a problem on impulse momentum theorem

472
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:49,141
在這節課中，我們將學習計算推動力
In it we shall learn to calculate impulse.

473
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:54,552
哇! 今天一點聲音都冇有
Wow! There was no sound today.

474
00:25:54,632 --> 00:25:57,306
你知道你這樣真的很變態吧
You know this is really inappropriate.

475
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,493
我為你感到高興，兄弟
I'm happy for you, buddy.

476
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,876
孩子們，我們今天要解決一個關於摩擦力的問題
Children, we will solve a problem on friction today.

477
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:06,793
正如你在圖片中看到的那樣，有兩個木塊
As you can see in the picture two blocks are made.

478
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:09,941
這兩個木塊都放在一個楔子上
Both the blocks are kept on a wedge

479
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,121
兩者都是用一根繩子連接起來的
..and both are connected with the help of a string.

480
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:17,954
blah blah blah…
[Educator speaking]

481
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:19,390
走吧？
Shall we?

482
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:21,563
已經六點半了
It is 6:30 already.

483
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:26,793
我們走
Let's go.

484
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:30,725
貼近理工學院的一小步
One step closer to IIT

485
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,934
這些是在課堂上完成的
That was done in class.

486
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:41,529
但我很高興你今天把作業做完了
But I'm glad today you came with DPP and sheets finished.

487
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:44,474
這就意味著你完全可以坐得更久
That means this chap is able to sit up longer.

488
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,017
是的
Yes, sir.

489
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,570
飲食問題解決了嗎？
Is food and water sorted?

490
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:50,208
是的，拜亞哥
Yes, Bhaiya.

491
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:51,909
你能正常拉屎了嗎？
Are you able to crap properly?

492
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,603
哦，兄弟！
Oh, Bhaiya!

493
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:56,778
來吧，你為什麼對我這麼害羞？
Come along. Why are you being shy with me?

494
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,124
我是你的知心大姐
I am your agony aunt.

495
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,930
我們還有很長的路要走
And we have a long journey together.

496
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:04,937
每個人都會有這樣那樣的問題
Everyone has these problems.

497
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:06,479
我也有
I too have them.

498
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:14,065
你學過物理化學嗎？
Have you been doing Physical Chemistry?

499
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,833
給我根煙
Give me one.

500
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,635
香煙？
A cigarette?

501
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,710
是的
Yes.

502
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,908
你不是戒煙了嗎？
Cigarette, Bhaiya?

503
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:24,155
當我感受不到刺激，情況在我掌控之中的時候
When I don't feel the urge and the situation is under control..

504
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:25,921
也是可以作弊的
..then you can cheat sometimes.

505
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,888
偶爾作弊是可以的
Cheating occasionally is fine.

506
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:36,903
但不要經常作弊
As long as it doesn't become a habit.

507
00:27:46,787 --> 00:27:47,815
- 怎麼了?-摩托車！
- What's the matter? - Auto!

508
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:50,547
趕緊去維根納加爾
Lets rush to Vigyan Nagar.

509
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,294
- 我們走，先生-拜亞哥！
- Let's go, sir. - Bhaiya!

510
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,557
- 拜亞哥!-回頭見
- Bhaiya! - I'll see you later.

511
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,172
發生了什麼？
What happened?

512
00:27:59,529 --> 00:28:00,309
大自然的召喚？
Nature's call?

513
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:01,416
是的
Yes.

514
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,562
米納
Meena.

515
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:07,975
來吧
Come.

516
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,561
現在才5點
It's only 5 O'clock.

517
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,291
我們走! 快！
Let's go! Come!

518
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,563
書又不會跑
It's always the same..

519
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:14,431
我們走！
Let's go!

520
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,485
讓我把這段看完
I just needed to study one more paragraph.

521
00:28:16,609 --> 00:28:17,760
這段學完會怎樣嗎？
What will you gain from studying one paragraph?

522
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:20,940
拜亞哥說了
Jeetu Bhaiya said so.

523
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:22,833
偶爾作弊是可以的
Occasional cheating is fine.

524
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:25,569
隻要不養成習慣
As long as you don't form a habit.

525
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,878
您撥打的電話無人接聽
'The person you are calling is not answering.

526
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,139
請稍後再試”
Please try later.'

527
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,338
他不接我電話
He's not picking my call.

528
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,611
他現在在一個快樂的地方
Now he is in a happy place.
