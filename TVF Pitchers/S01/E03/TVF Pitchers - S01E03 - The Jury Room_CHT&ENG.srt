我覺得你應該加入他們

10
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,720
不管怎樣，你得和爸爸談談這件事

11
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,380
我真的很想參與進來

12

除非你能解決他們的問題

13

否則他們就不需要你

但是，我還冇有給你發郵件
But, I haven't mailed you anything yet

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,730
郵件隱私是個神話，朋友

20
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,760
我想我們需要傑圖

你為什麼這麼怕你爸爸？

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,390
要有勇氣追隨自己的心聲和直覺，

34
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,950
它們在某種程度上知道你想成為的樣子

35
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,600
你們的想法很好
Your idea is very good.

36
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,810
我要去美國

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,390
等我從美國回來

那麼，西山
So, zeeshan!

我回到了2016年11月

你必須理解風險投資者的思維

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,900
他們都是有錢人

57
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,340
你們要穿得正式一點

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,810
看起來更專業一點

59
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,730
老闆! 我覺得這都是胡說八道

60
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,540
下次開會時穿 t 恤和拖鞋

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
把腳放在桌子上，告訴他

62
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,470
開張支票，不然我就走了

63
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,850
自信是關鍵

因此，一旦獲得足夠的用戶，我們就計劃籌集第二輪資金
So, once we acquire enough users, we plan to raise a second round

65
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,710

We might even go mobile only. Just like Flat-Chat!

66
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,620
你覺得怎麼樣？

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,580
你們需要多少資金？
How much funding do you need?

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,810
你們在兩年半的時間裏把公司運營的很好

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,680
投資者非常看好外賣業務

81
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560

我就給你資金

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,320
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

93
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,820
你拿不到我的錢
You will not get my money and

94
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,480
我會保證不會有人給你融資
I will make sure no body funds you in Hiranandaani.

95
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
你不能把腳擡起來

96
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,240
他會的，他為什麼不呢？

97
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,000
我在矽穀待了17年

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,110
泥土的芬芳把我帶到了這個國家

101
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,670
你知道，我想在印度做一些事情
You know, I want do something Indian

102
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,180
我們將打造印度的優步

103
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,310
我們稱之為印度步

104
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,360
你懂我的意思了吧

106
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,500
為什麼你的團隊裏冇有女性？
Why don't you have any females in your team?

107
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,190
你認為女人和男人不同？

108
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,260
我白手起家創辦了佐波羅
I started Zorpolo from scratch

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
今天，市值五仟萬
and today, it's worth 50 f**king million

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,390
你們為什麼冇有女性聯合創始人？
Why don't you have any female co-founders?

111
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,100
來和我一起唱，快點，怎麼了？
Come on join me.. come on.. what's wrong?

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,190
唱起來
come on.. come on..

113
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,380
融資的過程就好似一場摩訶婆羅多之戰
Getting a funding is equal to fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,560
雖然班度五子有五個人
Pandavas were 5 of them, though.

115
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,270
為了贏得這場戰爭，你們需要什麼？
Now to win this war, what do you guys need?

116
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,220

119
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,690
這是一個比喻
It was retorical

120
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,410
問問我們需要什麼？
Ask what is needed?

121
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,220
需要什麼，先生？
What is needed Sir?

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,710
我們需要什裏·克裏希納（印度神話中足智多謀的英雄）
We need Shree Krishna!

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,270
告訴我，你們中間誰是阿俊？
Tell me, who is Arjun among you guys?

124
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,480
阿俊？
Arjun?

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,530
應該是傑圖吧? 我應該是尤迪斯提爾

126
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,480
應該是傑圖吧? 我應該是尤迪斯提爾

我從不說謊

你是比姆? 不，我是比姆

129
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660

1972年
In 1972

136
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,270
我父親在比卡內爾的街上開了一家小店
my gradfather started a small bhujiya shop on the streets of Bikaner

137
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,920
一個小商店
a small shop

138
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
到了今天

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,460
無論是早餐與喝茶或啤酒搭配小吃
Weather its breakfast with tea or snacks with beer

140
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,170
人們隻認準我們的品牌，
it's only our brand, that people use

141
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,590
25年來，我們一直是市場的領導者
It's been 25 years, we are leading the market

142
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,860
我們還上了上個月《財富》雜誌的封麵
also we were on the cover page of last month's Fortune magazine.

143
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,490
盡管如此
Despite of all this

144
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,730
你知道人們在背後怎麼稱呼我們嗎？
Do you know what people call us behind our back?

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,890
他們說你什麼？
What do they say?

146
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,650
佈吉亞瓦拉（臭名昭著的印度食品品牌）
Bhujiyawaala!

147
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,250
這就是你想擴張到不同領域的原因嗎？
So that's why you want to expand to different sectors?

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,520
你越來越明白了
You are catching on..

149
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,750
我要把我的錢投資在新的冒險上
I am putting my money on new ventures

150
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,770
你們的産品很令人興奮
Your product is very exciting

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,450
非常適合我們的多樣化經營
Perfect for our diversification.

152
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,620
我想在你們身上投資
I want to invest in you guys

153
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,540
太好了，加裏
That's great Gary

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,750
實際上我們想稀釋15% 到20% 的股權
we actually wanted to dilute 15 to 20% of our equity

155
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,790
融資在120萬到160萬之間
for around 1.2 to 1.6

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,530
你們來決定金額
You guys decide the number

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,430
我來決定股權結構
I' ll decide the equity

158
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,890
我至少要51%
I want atleast 51%

159
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,990
但是先生，51% 的股份就等於你成了我們公司的老闆
But sir 51% practically makes you the owner of the company

160
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,110
公司？
Company?

161
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,940
你是說... 你們四個？
You mean.. four of you?

162
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
哈？
haan?

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,420
如果你們有一個人生病了，就連桌麻將都湊不齊
If one falls sick, you won't be having a proper teams to play carrom

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,290
還公司呢
Company!

165
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,250
你們的市場價格
Amount that you're asking for in the market

166
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,460
乘以4
multiplied by 4

167
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,540
再加上我的品牌
plus my brand

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,210
我的人脈
My contacts

169
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,630
還有辦公室
Plus new office space

170
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,330
這完全不是一筆壞交易
Its not a bad deal at all

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,860
先生，您能降低到30-35% 嗎
Sir can we negotiate somewhere around 30-35%

172
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,550
我不是來買菜的，混蛋
I am not selling vegetables, you As*h*le

173
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,750
那個…… 加裏，這是一個非常睏難的決定
Ah! Gary, but this is a very difficult decision

174
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,350
我們會仔細考慮，然後告訴你
we will think over it and let you know

175
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,540
51% 已經很多了
like 51% is a lot

176
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,440
克裏斯克先生曾經問過親人阿俊
Shree Kriskna had asked Arjun, the blood of his own family members

177
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,930
我隻是想要更多的股權
I am just asking for a little more stake

178
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
冇其他的了
nothing much.

179
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,690
我們星期天再談
Will talk about it on Sunday

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
帕斯
Parth.

181
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,110
帕斯？
Parth?

182
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,430
我叫納文
Naveen.

183
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,950
帕斯
Parth!

184
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,780
對不起! 對不起! 對不起... 對不起
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry... Sorry.

185
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,920
不用，你自己走吧
No no.. Please.

186
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,950
走啊
Go on..

187
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,500
我不想拖你的後腿
I don't want to hold you back.

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,730
不，我在考慮加裏的提議
No.. I was thinking about Gary's proposal..

189
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,180
納文
Naveen!

190
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,570
你知道嗎，我們現在差不多一周才見一次麵
Do you realise we, meet like once a week now.

191
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,580
我去你家的時候你都很忙
You'll be busy when I come to your place

192
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,790
你就不能和我好好聊5分鍾嗎？
Can't you talk to me for 5 minutes properly?

193
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,840
對不起，對不起
I'm sorry. sorry!

194
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,240
你不覺得這些天你說對不起太頻繁了嗎？
Don't you think you have been saying sorry too often these days?

195
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,290
對不..
Iam sor....

196
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,120
是啊，最近我搞砸了很多事情
Yeah maybe I am screwing up a lot these days

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,230
我真的很抱歉
I am really sorry

198
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,220
我真的很抱歉
I am really sorry

199
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,150
納文，這樣不行
Naveen, Its not gonna work like this.

200
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,290
我們得談談
We need to talk..

201
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,800
對不起對不起
I am sorry.. I am sorry..

202
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,610
寶貝，你害怕了？
Aww Baby.. You got scared?

203
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
一點都不好笑
Arey. It's not funny.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,730
尤吉說
Yogi was saying

205
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,180
艾什就是這麼分手的
Ashish brokeup the same way

206
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,290
他忙於創業
He got busy with the startup

207
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,620
他忙於創業
He got busy with the startup

208
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,790
冇時間陪女朋友
he couldn't give time to his girlfriend

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
胡說八道
What nonsense!

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
真是陳詞濫調
such a cliche.

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
但是陳詞濫調的存在是有原因的
But cliches exists for a reason

212
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,600
讓我們來點刺激的？
Let us do some clihe?

213
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,310
我們去果阿吧
Let's go to Goa.

214
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,680
你的班加羅爾之旅怎麼辦？
What about your Bangalore trip?

215
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
我不去了
I'll skip it

216
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,590
而且我們甚至不知道這個周末後我們什麼時候有時間
and moreover we dont even know when we get time after this weekend.

217
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,340
別犯傻了
Don't be foolish and

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,320
暫時忘掉工作吧
ignore the job.

219
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,420
在接下來的30年裏，就算我不陪著你了，你的工作也會一直伴隨著你
Your job stays with you for the next 30 years, even if I don't

220
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,780
去班加羅爾吧

221
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,770
我們去果阿吧
Lets go to Goa!

222
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:33,880
It's just a small project, anyway
It's just a small project, anyway

223
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,640
無論如何，這隻是一個小項目
It's just a small project, anyway

224
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,280
這是你的工作
Arey, its your work ya

225
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,250
不要欺騙你的工作
Don't cheat your work!

226
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,390
改天再去果阿
Will go to Goa someother time.

227
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,310
好啊，那你以什麼身份去？
Ok. What defines you better?

228
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,960
麥肯錫的商業顧問還是納文·班薩爾的女朋友？
Business Consultant at Mckenzie or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

229
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,550

230
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,450
好吧
Ok fine.

231

我去班加羅爾
I will go to Bangalore

232
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,630
高興了吧
Happy?

233
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,670
一點都不浪漫
Very unromantic as*hole

234
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,730
什麼不浪漫啊
What un-romantic as*hole

235
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,700
我們在這裏也可以玩得很開心
We can have fun here as well.

236
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,690
想喝點什麼嗎？

237
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,900
一份榛子卡普奇諾和一份雞肉三明治
Ya.. One hazelnut cappucino and one Chicken tikka sandwich

238
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
請來一杯茶和兩杯咖啡
One tea and two idlis please.

239
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
甜點呢？

240
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,460
你這有什麼煙？
and what cigerrates do you have?

241
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,110
戈德弗雷克，先生
Goldflake. Sir

242
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,410
周三，我畫出了第二幅 FD
I have drawn the second FD too on wednesday.

243
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
尤吉正在尋找貸款
Yogi is looking for loan

244
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,830
不知道還要依賴曼達爾多久
and don't know how much to depend on Mandal!

245
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,330
關於加裏的提議
and about Gary's proposal

246
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,540
有時覺得這是必須的
at times feel it's a necessity

247
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,270
有時我又覺得很貪婪
and some times I feel its greed!

248
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,600
但是你不一定要滿足於加裏
But you don't have to necessarily settle for Gary

249
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,300
明天你有個活動
Tomorrow, you have an event

250
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,680
不會有潛在的投資者嗎？
won't there be potential investors?

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
會有... 但是..
there will be.. But..

252
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,590
也許這是最後一次了
may be for one last time.

253
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,390
我們冇時間了，史瑞雅
We are running out of time, Shreya

254
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,540
如果冇有一個投資者對我們明天的展示感興趣
If none of the investors show any interest in our tommorow's presentation

255
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,870
我們可能隻有加裏這一條路了
we might have to go with Gary

256
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,620
你有冇有試過庭審的方法？
Did you try your Jury room approach?

257
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,650
不，還冇有
No.. not yet.

258
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,840
你的三個合夥人怎麼說？
What do your 3 stooges say?

259
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,550
目前都還冇有說什麼
Nothing as yet

260
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,760
他們指望我做出正確的決定
They are banking on me to take the right decision.

261
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,630
這讓我更害怕了
That's getting me more scared

262
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,360
我現在就可以擁抱你
I could hug you right now

263
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,770
說你會成功的
and say that you will be great

264
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,870
你會做出正確的決定
you will make the right decision

265
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,930
或者
or

266
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,920
我可以不那麼誇張地告訴你
I could be less dramatic and tell you

267
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
我相信你 納文巴薩爾
I believe in you Naveen Bansal

268
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
和在家裏等你的那三個男孩一樣
Just like the 3 boys waiting for you at home.

269
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,880
哦，該死
Oh Shit!

270
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,770
發生了什麼？
What happened?

271
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,380
等等，等等，我能打包嗎? 6個點心，2杯茶..
wait.. wait.. can I get a parcel..? 6 idli's, 2 chai...

272
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,820
先生，我收攤了
Sir. Food got over.

273
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,200
他怎麼還不回來？
Where is he still?

274
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,680
他說他15分鍾後回來，現在已經兩個小時了
He said he will return in 15 minutes, its been 2 hours now.

275
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,750
叫我等一下喝杯茶
asked me to wait just for a tea.

276
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,520
我得回家睡覺了
I need to go home and sleep

277
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,810
尤基，現在就給他打電話
Yogi, call him now.

278
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,830
他把手機落在這兒了
He left his phone here

279
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,400
我們可以在這裏自己泡茶
we would have made tea here itself

280
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,890
如果這個沙雕冇有把所有的牛奶來凝乳
If this as*hole wouldn't have used all the milk to set the curd

281
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,820
明天是個重要的日子
Tomorrow is an important day

282
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,280
如果我們不吃凝乳和糖，我們怎麼會走運呢？
How do we get lucky if we don't eat curd and sugar?

283
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,350
閉嘴! 你這個廢物
Shut up! You piece of crap

284
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,270
沙雕
As*hole

285
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,890
在過去的6個小時裏，你唯一的作用就是更改了謝謝的字體
For the last 6 hours you are only changing the font of Thank You.

286
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,640
留下一個持久的印象是很重要的
Aey.. Aey.. Its very important to make a lasting impression. Ok!

287
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,700
至少我早上起來冇去城裏閒逛
Atleast I am not roaming around the city since morning

288
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,100
我去印名片了，你這個混蛋
I had been to print visiting cards, you motherf*ckr

289
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,450
當你和投資者見麵時，他們要求聯係你，你會怎麼做？
What do you do when you meet investors and they ask for contacts?

290
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,850
夥計們，這是怎麼回事？
Guys, what's happening here?

291
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,630
納文， 這是辦公室騷擾
Naveen, this is harrasement at work place

292
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,550
我不能這樣工作
I can't work like this.

293
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,390
我不能容忍這種事
I can't tolerate this.

294
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,230
你不能忍受什麼？
What you can't tolerate?

295
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,300
你會把我的筆記本電腦帶到房間然後看著華爾街之狼打飛機
You 'll take my laptop to the room and jerk off watching Wolf of Wallstreet

296
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
不，我是在準備演講
No, I was preparing for the pitch.

297
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,740
老子搞死你
I''ll kill you ba*t**d

298
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,200
你知道我在觸摸闆上看到了什麼嗎？
You know what I saw on touchpad?

299
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,740
尤吉，你在說什麼？
Yogi, what are you saying man?

300
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
我們都用上了消毒劑，傑圖你跟他說
We had to use sanitizer, Jeetu tell him.

301
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,600
別這樣，尤吉
Stop it.. Stop it Yogi.

302
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,380
尤吉，註意你的年齡
Yogi, Behave your age.

303
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,850
你從10年級開始就在欺負我們
You are bullying us since 10th standard.

304
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
別說了
Stop it now.

305
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,540
曼達爾，他說得對，那天觸摸闆上有東西
Madal, he's right. there's was something on the touchpad that day!

306
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,260
傑圖! 你在懷疑我嗎？
Jeetu! You are doubting me?

307
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,160
我發誓，那隻是凝乳
I swear, it was just curd.

308
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,290
傑圖 放鬆
Jeetu relax

309
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,290
我們明天有活動，別緊張
we have an event tomorrow, don't be stressed.

310
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,740
你安靜點
You be quiet.

311
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
你知道什麼是壓力嗎？
Do you even know what stress is?

312
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,270
桑亞三天之前想吃西瓜
Soumya is asking for watermelon from past 3 days

313
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
我不能買給她是因為
and I am not able to do it because

314
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,620
過去兩天我都在處理一個編譯錯誤
from past 2 days I am getting a compilation error

315
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,100
我已經在這裏待兩天了，已經筋疲力盡了
I am lying here since 2 days and I am exhausted doing this

316
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,430
我想今天好好睡一覺，為明天的活動做好準備
I thought of having a good sleep today to be ready for tomorrow's event

317
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,740
但現在你遲到了兩個小時，把一切都毀了
But now you ruined it by coming two hours late

318
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,510
現在包裏瓦利市場早上6點開市
Now, the market at Borivali opens at 6am

319
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,710
我得去那裏買
I have to buy it from there.

320
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,650
桑亞還要叫我去買新鮮的魚
Soumya will also ask me to get fresh fish also

321
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,200
所以我需要一手拿著西瓜，一手拿著魚
So I need to carry watermelon in one hand and fish in the other

322
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,270
然後從包裏瓦利坐火車
and travel in local train from Borivilli

323
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,830
因為我的自行車輪胎被紮破了
because my bike is punctured and

324
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,680
我冇有時間去修，因為我已經待在這裏兩天了
no time to repair it because I am lying here since the last two days

325
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,840
強調一下
Stress it seems.

326
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,530
接一下
Hold this!

327
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,150
早餐準備好了嗎？
Is breakfast ready?

328
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,400
麻煩快一點
Set it up quickly, please!

329
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,380
你看到我的信息了嗎？
Did you read my message?

330
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,910
我還冇時間看
I don't have time now

331
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,610
我已經遲到半小時了
I am already runing late by half an hour

332
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,220
我得收拾一下趕緊走了
I have to get fresh and leave.

333
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,570
星期天早上你要去哪兒，孩子？
Where are you going on Sunday morning, son?

334
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,170
爸爸
Dad!

335
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,580
不是的，我侄子說
Arey No.. my nephew was saying

336
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,760
維斯瓦納坦 · 阿南德根本不喜歡油炸伊德利
Vishwanathan Anand doesn't like fried idli at all

337
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,780
什麼？
What?

338
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
說真的
Ya seriously

339
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,560
人太多了
Too much crowd..

340
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,820
這些二十四五歲的孩子一畢業就想開公司
These 24-25 years kids try to start the company as soon as they get out of college.

341
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,590
他們中的一半甚至可能都不知道企業家怎麼拚寫
Half of them might not even know the spelling of entreprenuer

342
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,650
都是弟弟
All virgin as*es!

343
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,360
那個女孩看起來比較小
That qeue looks smaller.

344
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,910
這裏是在排隊簽到嗎？
Is this the line for Registration?

345
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,530
不
No!

346
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,290
我們在這等著領通行證
We are standing to pick up the ration

347
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,630
哈哈哈
hahaha

348
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,940
一幫沙雕

349
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,860
你認識他嗎？
Do you know him?

350
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:39,860
誰？
whom?

351
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,990
他叫阿米特·阿瓦斯蒂，那家夥想成為紮克伯格
That guy. Wanna be Zukerburg, Amit Awasti.

352
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,650

completed his B-Tech from NIT Hamirpur

353
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,620
卻穿著哈沃德T恤炫耀
but wears Harward T-shit to show-off

354
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,910
他是"訴訟律師"的創始人
He is the founder of Litigator

355
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
訴訟律師？
Litigator?

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,950
一個律師的社交網絡app
Its the social network for Lawyers.

357
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,530
去年3月，他們與聯合創始人就股權問題發生了爭執
They had issues with co-founder regarding equity last March

358
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,990
他們用他自己的應用程序對他提起訴訟
They used his own app to file a lawsuit against him

359
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
你認識他嗎？

360
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
誰? 囧雪？
who? John Snow?

那個穿黑西裝的家夥？
That guy in black suit?

363
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,880
黑西裝
Oh..the guy in black suit?

364
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,070
對

365
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,490
對

哦哦

Milkman. I've heard about it. Its like the Uber of dairy products

371
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,000

372
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,950
那是一個在線馬廄
Its just an online stable.

2012年，它的名字是 dudhwala. com..
In 2012, it started of with the name dudhwala.com...

374
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,240
但後來政府以為它是色情網站，就禁止了它
but then government banned it thinking it's a porn website.

375
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,630
現在他們用一個新的名字重新啓動了它
Now they have relaunched it with a new name.

376
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,200
順便說一下，我是索拉佈 · 曼達爾
By the way, I'm Saurabh Mandal.

377
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
這是納文 巴薩爾

378
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,190
還有尤吉

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
你好，先生
Hello sir.

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,600
你有 VC 嗎？
Do you have a VC ?

381
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,600
名片？
Visiting card ?

382
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
有有有，剛印好的
Yes, I do. Freshly baked .

383
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,800
那就交換一下吧
Then give it.

384
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,120
事實上，在這樣的場合中你會遇到很多欺詐行為
Actually you meet a lot of frauds in such events.

385
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
上次有個混蛋拍了一張自拍，說“我是拉胡爾 · 亞達夫”
Last time some asshole clicked a selfie saying "I am Rahul Yadav".

386
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,960
後來我才知道那個混蛋是個學生
Later I got to know that asshole was just a B.com student from Mithibhai.

387
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
用兩隻手遞名片，一隻手不禮貌
Give it using two hands... With one hand is cnsidered unluncky!

388
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,850
我們都是同齡人，這些應該不用我告訴你的
You should be knowing all of this, we are of same age.

389
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,770
拿著
Take it.

390
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,250
對，就像這樣

拉維 · 拉斯托吉
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

392
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,230

Superentreprenuer.com 創始人

395
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,460
這是我的第八家公司
This is my 8th company

396
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,690
在這之前的那七家呢？

397
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,400
都倒閉了
They were shut down.

398
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,890
哦
Oh!

399
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,270
哦
Oh!

400
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,100
但是這一次我將進入財富500強
But this one will take me to the list of Fortune 500

401
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
等著瞧吧
Wait and Watch!

402
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,120
事情是... 聽好了
Thing is.. Hello..

403
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,470
事情是這樣的
So the thing is

404
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,430
企業家的靈魂總是不安分的
The soul of entreprenuer is always restless.

405
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,950
它會一直遊蕩，直到你想出一個傑作
It will roaming around untill you come up with a masterpiece.

406
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,850
這麼說隻有你們三個？
So only 3 of you guys?

407
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,490
不，先生
No sir..

408
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,440
不，不，很好
No.. no. Its good.

409
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,360
聯合創始人數量越少，股權價值就越高
The lesser number of co-founders, higher will be the equity value.

410
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,480
不，先生，我們有四個人，傑圖正在來的路上
No sir, we are four of us. Jeetu is on his way

411
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,730
尤吉，打電話問他在哪裏？
Yogi, call him and ask where did he reach?

412
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,750
好吧 那就是8% 的損失
Oho.. that's like 8% loss.

413
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,180
冇問題，繼續
No problem, carry on!

414
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,300
算了吧，爸爸
Leave it Dad.

415
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,280
在保修期內
It's in the warranty

416
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,790
公司的人會免費來修的
company guy will come and fix it for free.

417
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,430
你學的是計算機科學而不是機械
haan. You studied computer science instead of mechanical

418
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,540
你可能會厭倦做這些事情
you might get tired to do all these stuffs

419
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
給我一個更大的螺絲刀？
give me a bigger screw driver?

420
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,450
尤吉：你在哪裏

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,540
你手機裏有螺絲刀嗎？
are you looking for app for it?

422
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
不，不，是關於工作的
No.. no. Its about work

423
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,540
瓦欽說
Watchen was saying..

424
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,270
你兩天冇回家了
You didn't come home for 2 days.

425
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
是這樣的，爸爸
Actually Dad.

426
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,130
公司的人讓他加班
the company guys are making him work a lot

427
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,210
因為這個項目
beacuse of the project

428
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
他們每天都給他打電話，星期天都不讓休息
they call him daily, even on sundays

429
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,190
你去收拾一下
You get fresh

430
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
準備好
get ready

431
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,150
爸爸，你想吃西瓜嗎？
Dad, would you want to eat watermelon?

432
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,160
你們星期天有什麼項目？
What kind of project do you have on Sunday's?

433
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,330
打電話告訴你老闆
Call your boss and tell

434
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,190
打電話告訴你老闆
Call your boss and tell

435
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,250
你爸爸從比卡內爾來看你，所以今天不能加班
your dad has come from Bikaner, so can't come today.

436
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,330
把電話給我，讓我跟你老闆說
give the phone, let me speak to him

437
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,510
爸爸，事情不是這樣的
Dad, It doesn't work that way.

438
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,200
我隻待一天
have just come for a day

439
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,810
如果不是為了潘迪亞吉女兒的婚禮
If not for Pandyaji's daughter wedding

440
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,230
我才不來
I wouldn't have come.

441
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,900
你就不能和你爸爸吃個午飯嗎
Can't you have lunch with your dad for a day

442
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,630
冇有你，你的公司不會倒閉的
your company won't shut down without you.

443
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,480
現在翅膀這麼硬了嗎
Yu have grown up now right!

444
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,420
不是那樣的，爸爸
nothing like that Dad.

445
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,260
我馬上回來
I will just be back.

446
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,960
嘿! 我在跟你說話呢
Hey! I am talking to you!

447
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,130
給你老闆回複一句等會再說
Send TTYL to your boss

448
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,300
爸爸
Dad

449
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,830
西瓜
Watermelon

450
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,710
餵，尤吉
Hello Yogi.

451
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,610
尤吉，我不能去了
Yogi i can't come

452
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,980
我爸突然來我家了
All of a sudden dad showed up!

453
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,560
什麼?
What nonsense?!

454
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,740
是的! 他不讓我走
yes! He is not allowing me to leave.

455
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,590
不讓走？
Not allowing to leave?

456
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,730
你是四年級學生嗎？
Are you a 4th grader?

457
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
唉……尤吉
Arey Yogi.

458
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,700
傑圖？
Jeetu?

459
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,380
好的，爸爸，我來了
Yes dad i am coming.

460
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,590
我在說重要的事，你卻在撒尿?
I am talking something important, and you are peeing?!

461
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,500
等等吧，尤吉
Just wait Yogi.

462
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
傑圖？
Jeetu?

463
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,160
研討會快結束了，午餐後的活動很關鍵
The seminar is about end, post lunch is our main event.

464
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,110
快點過來
Leave quickly!

465
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,880
尤吉，我一會兒再和你談
Yogi I will talk to you later

466
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,730
傑圖？
Jeetu?

467
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
是的，爸爸
yes dad!

468
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,310
這是什麼？
What is this?

469
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,940
看起來像一條內褲
looks like a boxer

470
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,850
它卡在水箱後麵了
it was stuck behind the tank

471
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,260
你都冇有時間檢查下洗了多少衣服嗎
You don't even have time to keep your clothes in check.

472
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,180
你在洗手間幹什麼？
and what were you doimg in the bathroom?

473
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,430
冇什麼，電話..
nothing.. phone...

474
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,550
我在小便
I was peeing.

475
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,490
小便之後你要洗手
you will wash your hands after that or

476
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,410
不然公司的人都會開始不洗手
anyone from the company will come to do it.

477
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,800
真的非常抱歉，但這是我第四次告訴您
I'm really really sorry sir, but this is the fourth time i'm telling you

478
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,660
除非團隊人到齊了，否則我不能給你們通行證
that i can not give you the passes until the entire team registered

479
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
但是你總得讓我們創業啊
But madam you have to let us startup

480
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,150
這是我們的名片
This is our VC card

481
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
對不起，先生，我們必須遵守一些規定
I am sorry sir. We have to follow certain guidelines.

482
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,240
聽著
See, listen...

483
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,280
阿普爾瓦
Apoorva..

484
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,150
阿普爾瓦，我們的朋友在路上了
Apoorva, our friend is on his way.

485
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,960
難道不能先給我們三張通行證嗎
Isn't it possible to first give us our three passes.

486
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
朋友的通行證等他到了你再給他
Like, you can hold on to our friend's pass.

487
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,600
他到的時候來找你拿
He will collect it from you, when he is here.

488
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,600
讓我看看
Let me check.

489
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,880
納文
Naveen.

490
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,840
納文
Naveen.

491
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
納文……
Naveen..

492
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,150
其實我
Actually I

493
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,000
剛剛發現..
just found out that...

494
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
這裏不是電影院
this is not a movie theatre...

495
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,630
我們不能幫忙保管通行證
and we cannot hold on to your passes.

496
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
但是我們已經付了註冊費..
But we have paid the registration fee....

497
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,670
每人1857盧比
1,857 Rupees per head.

498
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,720
先生，麻煩你靠邊站
Sir, you're holding the que, could you please step aside.

499
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,150
你不能這樣對我們..
You can't do this to us...

500
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,920
你找你領導出來
I want to speak to the management.

501
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,520
她怎麼能這樣跟我們說話？
How can she talk to us like this ?

502
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,960
我會讓你被炒魷魚的
I'll get you fired.

503
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
記住我的話
Mark my words.

504
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,960
戰鬥才剛剛開始
The battle has just begun.

505
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,280
一場1857盧比的戰爭
The battle of 1,857 rupees.

506
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,520
諸神不會放過她的
Mangal and Pandey wont let her be.

507
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,630
別說了
Stop it.

508
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
什麼人啊
What rubbish !

509
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
她怎麼能這樣跟我們說話
How can she talk to us like this.

510
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
放鬆
Relax.

511
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
讓我們想想辦法
Let's figure out something.

512
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,190
還有什麼辦法？
Figure out what?

513
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
她有每個人的檔案
She has everyone's profiles.

514
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
傑圖不來我們就進不去
We won't get entry without jitu

515
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
早就說了，走之前我們應該吃點糖和豆腐吧
I told you, let's have sugar and curd before leaving.

516
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,430
曼達爾，你快別bb了
Mandal, Please don't start again.

517
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
不要回答
Dont' answer.

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
回答
Answer.

519
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
嗨，加裏
Hi Gary..

520
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,240
加裏，我現在有點忙，過會兒我再打電話給你行嗎？
Gary, I am little busy, can I call you after sometime ?

521
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,710
演講還冇開始呢
There's still time for the presentation to start, Parth..

522
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
你就已經開始忙了？
You're already busy ?

523
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
不是，我冇有，加裏
No Gary.

524
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
我們隻是來看朋友的
We just came here to see a friend.

525
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,400
在這種場合不會遇到朋友
One doesn't meet friends in such events...

526
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,680
你要麼遇到競爭對手，要麼遇到投資者
You either meet your competition or investors!

527
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
別把我當傻瓜
Don't think of me as an idiot.

528
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,870
聽著
And Listen..

529
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
你把免提打開
Put your phone on loudspeaker

530
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,630
這樣你就不用比劃了
Then you won't have to play Dumb charades.

531
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
好
Ya.

532
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,640
我冇有生氣..
I'm not upset...

533
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,320
如果我是你，我也會這麼做的
If I was in your place I would have done the same.

534
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,200
你應該為你們的産品爭取一個好價錢
You should get a good value for a good product..

535
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,840
冇有比這更好的地方來實現你的産品價值了
and there is no better place then such events to realize your product's value.

536
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
加裏，這是個好活動，但是我們..
Gary, It is a good event but we're.....

537
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,840
趕時間? 我知道
In a hurry ? I know..

538
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,630
你得見很多投資者..
You have to meet a lot of investors...

539
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,600
討論一下你們的未來計劃
have to discuss you're future plans

540
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
我知道
I know..

541
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,760
但在那之前，你不想聽聽我的新提議嗎？
But before that, you dont want to listen to my new offer ?

542
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,430
新的提議？
New offer ?

543
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
我想了很多
I thought a lot..

544
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,150
然後我意識到這筆交易對你們有點不公平
Then I realised that this deal is little unfair for you..

545
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,920
所以我們這樣，在你們的報價後麵……
So the amount which you guys had proposed?

546
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,600
加一個零
Suffix a zero to the number.

547
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
加裏
Gary..

548
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,720
那可是一大筆錢
That's a lot of money!

549
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
冇錯
No.

550
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,670
你想要很多錢..
You wanted a lot of money...

551
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
我現在就給你錢，十倍哦
and I am giving you a lot of money X 10

552
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
但是當然..
But ofcourse...

553
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,720
股本將是相同的... 51%
Equity will be the same... 51%.

554
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,950
這冇有商量的餘地
That is non-negotiable.

555
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,160
我正要去我的羅納瓦拉農捨
I'm on my way to my lonavala farmhouse...

556
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,560
參加會議
For a meeting.

557
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,240
在我到達之前給我你的答案..
Give me your answer before I get there...

558
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,400
否則交易取消
Or the offer stands cancelled.

559
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
否則交易取消
Or the offer stands cancelled.

560
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,320
另外……
And ya...

561
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,520
如果你在那之前找到投資者的話……
If you get an investor before that then..

562
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
祝你一切順利
All the best.

563
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,800
但是加裏，我怎麼能這麼快回複你呢
But Gary how will I reply so fast

564
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,670
納文，你是啤酒
Naveen you're beer

565
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,150
而我是蛇
And I am snakcs!

566
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,360
如果我們兩個聚在一起，會很熱鬨的
If we both get together, we'll have a party!

567
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
我會等你的電話..
I'll be waiting for your call...

568
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
帕斯
Parth.

569
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
他剛才是不是給我們……
Did he just offer us...

570
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,440
在這樣的關鍵時刻，傑圖總是不見蹤影
Jitu always goes missing in such crucial times.

571
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,320
曼達爾再給他發一次短信-好的
Mandal just text him once. -okay.

572
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,870
你怎麼想
What are you thinking ?

573
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,290
我需要一個陪審室
I need a jury room.

574
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
聞起來真香
Smells nice!

575
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
你加味精了嗎？
Have you added ajwaine?

576
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,670
是的，爸爸
Yes papa.

577
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
海魚有一種很獨特的味道
Salt water fish have a very unique taste..

578
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
很柔軟
They're very soft soft.

579
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,960
是啊
ya.

580
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,910
我們那就吃不到
We don't get it over at our place!

581
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,820
加裏提出10倍價格收購我們的項目，他要馬上給答複，給我回電話快點

582
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,760
我兩分鍾後回來
I'll be back in two minutes.

583
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,280
吃著飯呢你要去哪裏？
Where are you going at lunch time ?

584
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,920
就在附近買點牛奶... 樓下
Just closeby to get some milk... Rgiht below the building!

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
送牛奶的早上已經來了
The milkman has already come in the morning!

586
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,120
爸爸，我想我晚上會給你準備一些拉比
Dad. I though I'll prepare some 'Rabdi' for you in the evening!

587
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
牛奶少了，所以我讓他去買
There was less milk so I asked him to.

588
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,800
是的，她讓我這麼做的
Ya she asked me to.

589
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,480
是的，她讓我這麼做的
Ya she asked me to.

590
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
但是你為什麼要在這麼熱的天氣裏出去呢？
But why do you need to go in this heat???

591
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,800
我下次會吃的
I will have it next time.

592
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
不，爸爸，不麻煩，我堅持
No Dad. It's no trouble. I insist.

593
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
桑婭做的臘腸很好吃，我2分鍾就回來
Saumya makes nice 'rabdi'. I'll go get it in 2.

594
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,960
等一下，傑圖
Wait a minute Jitu.

595
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,430
回來坐下
Sit over here.

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,360
閨女過來
Beta (daughter) listen.

597
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
去把這藥給我煎了
Make me this concoction.

598
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
爸爸，我可以在午飯後去嗎？
Papa, can I make it after lunch ?

599
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,670
不行，醫生讓我午飯時吃
No, the doctor has asked me to have it with lunch.

600
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
聽好了
And listen.

601
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,360
慢慢來，慢慢煮
Take your time and boil it for long!

602
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
不用著急
There's no hurry.

603
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
好的，爸爸
Yes, Papa.

604
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,840
老實告訴我
Tell me honestly.

605
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
你要去哪裏
Where were you going.

606
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
爸爸，去買牛奶，還有什麼
Papa, to buy milk, whatelse.

607
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,150
你是要去抽煙吧
You were going to smoke a ciggarette.

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,240
爸爸，我在大學裏就戒煙了
Papa, I quit smoking in college.

609
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,560
不要撒謊
Don't lie.

610
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,960
我在你公文包裏找到了幾根煙
I've found a few in your office bag!

611
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,670
爸爸
Papa..

612
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
我還要為你撒多少謊？
How much should I lie for you ?

613
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
在你結婚前..
Before marriage...

614
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,280
結婚前，我不得不對帕瑞瑪撒謊說你不喝酒也不抽煙
Before marriage I had to lie to Parimal that you dont drink or smoke..

615
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,920
他們把女兒嫁到我們家是因為他們信任我們
They married their daughter into our family because they had trust in us.

616
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,880
你也答應過你媽媽
And you had promised your mom

617
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,760
你會戒煙
That you would quit smoking!

618
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
你戒了嗎？
Did you quit?

619
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
好吧，對不起，爸爸
Okay, Sorry papa.

620
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,200
如果你真的想抽煙，那就嚼口香糖吧
If you get desperate to smoke than have a chewing gum .

621
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,950
哈迪亞爾就是這樣戒煙的
Hardiyal quit it the same way.

622
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,400
好吧，爸爸，那我去樓下買點薄荷糖來
Okay Papa then I will go, get some mint from downstairs!

623
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
給你
Here.

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
拿去吧
Have it.

625
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
如果你再發出一點聲音
If you make one more sound

626
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,280
我會把機油倒你嘴裏讓你漱口
I will put castrol in your mouth and make you gargle it.

627
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,950
我們還在等什麼？
What are we waiting for ?

628
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,560
我們已經賺翻了
We are getting soo much money now!

629
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,880
如果我們繼續拖時間，那這些錢就冇了
If we take more time then even this plan will get ruined.

630
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,600
納文有做決定的權利
Naveen has the first right to take a decision.

631
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,800
等他從陪審室出來
Let him come out of the jury room.

632
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
然後我們再做決定
Then we will decide.

633
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,280
這個陪審室是幹什麼的？
What is this jury room ?

634
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,200
我從大學時就看他這樣做過
I've been sseing it since our college time.

635
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,400
每當納文麵對睏境時
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

636
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
每當納文麵對睏境時
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

637
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,120
他會把自己鎖在房間裏15分鍾
He locks himself in a room for 15 minutes.

638
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
然後做出正確的決定
And he comes out with the right decision.

639
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,560
這就是為什麼我們稱之為陪審室
And thats why we call it a jury room.

640
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,960
但是在這種場合，他是怎麼找到空房間的呢？
But in such a busy event, how did he find a empty room ?

641
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,520
這是典型的性別歧視
This is the height of sexism.

642
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,120
難道他們根本就不想讓女性企業家來嗎？
What, were they not expecting female entreprenuers at all ?

643
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,360
男廁所開著，但女廁所卻鎖著
Gents washroom is open but the female washroom is locked!

644
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,120
在這樣的比賽中你碰到很多這樣的事情
You will get a lot of mcps in such events.

645
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,920
你知道嗎
You know what..

646
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,360
甚至在我的名片上印的都是我兄弟的電話號碼
Even in my visiting card I have given my brothers number.

647
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
你是怎麼做到的？
And how did you ?

648
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,760
如果一百塊能夠說服英國人... ..
If one Gandhiji can convice lacks of britishers ...

649
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,920
為什麼二百塊不能說服保潔員
Why wouldn't a housekeeper get convinced with two!

650
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
你們還在這兒？
You guys are still here ?

651
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,200
是啊
Ya.

652
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,400
冇回家？
Didn't go home?

653
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
冇回家？
Didn't go home?

654
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,670
你們公司的 CEO 在哪裏？
Where is that CEO of your's ?

655
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
我們正在等他
Actually that's who we are waiting for!

656
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,280
如果你有時間的話
If you're wasting time...

657
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
那就在推特上關註我吧
Then follow me on twitter!

658
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,840
好啊
Ya ya..

659
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
我有198個粉絲
I have 198 followers.

660
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
如果你們兩個都關註我，那麼那就破二百了
If you both follow me, then it'll become a double century.

661
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,440
媽的
Shit !

662
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,910
我隻有116個粉..
I have only 116...

663
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,960
但是我在領英上有312個粉絲
But I have 312 followers on linkedIn.

664
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,880
312？
312 ?

665
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
媽的
Shit !

666
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,280
等我的應用程序發佈
Just wait for my app to get launched..

667
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,280
看我怎麼追上你
Then watch how I overtake you.

668
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
你為什麼不去那邊交朋友呢？
Why can't you go there and do your networking ?

669
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,270
其實我在等我的室友
Actually I am waiting for my roommate..

670
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,280
其實我在等我的室友
I forgot my keys.

671
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,400
我忘帶鑰匙了
I forgot my keys.

672
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,230
我忘帶鑰匙了
I forgot my keys.

673
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
我忘帶鑰匙了

674
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
其他七個人都被淘汰了
Even the other 7 are out.

675
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,440
他是來給我送鑰匙的
So he is coming to give me the keys.

676
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
你們是9個人住在一起嗎？
You'll are 9 people staying together?

677
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
四居室？
4 BHK ?

678
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,390
不不
No No..

679
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
兩居室
It's a 2 BHK

680
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
但空間足夠大
But spacious enough.

681
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,280
74平
800 sqft.

682
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,720
其實
Actually

683
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,240
自從我2008年離婚後..
Since I got a divorced in 2008...

684
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,800
我就不得不住在合租房裏
I've to live in a shared apartment!

685
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,520
這樣可以建立
It helps you build..

686
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
團隊精神
Teamspirit.

687
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
你離婚了？
You had a divorce ?

688
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
是的
Yes.

689
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
對不起
Sorry.

690
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,520
你為什麼說對不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

691
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,120
你為什麼說對不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

692
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
當她不說對不起的時候
When she is not saying sorry..

693
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,200
你為什麼說對不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

694
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,050
冇關係
It's okay.

695
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,680
並不是每個人的婚姻都那麼完美
Everyone is not that lucky to have a Sudhamurthi in their life.

696
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,920
等我的公司拿到融資
Once my company gets funded...

697
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,920
老子一天換一個女朋友
Just wait and watch how 'Manglik' girls line up for me!

698
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,830
但是這麼多年來，你一次融資也冇拿到？
But in so many years you didn't get funded even once ?

699
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
也不是……
I did..

700
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
2003年的時候
In 2003 I did..

701
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,600
有一個投資者準備投我
There was an investor who was ready to invest..

702
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,360
但是要求50% 的股權
But was asking for 50% equity.

703
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,310
但是我們的創始人兼首席執行官
And our founder and CEO

704
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
有點像佛祖
Was sort of a buddha type..

705
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
他拒絕了
Said no to it .

706
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,720
從那以後直到今天... 我嚮上帝發誓
Since then till today... I swear to god

707
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,600
我唯一一次睡安穩覺的時候是在火車的臥鋪車廂裏
The only time I have slept peacefully is while travelling in a train's sleeper class.

708
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,150
餵
Ya karunesh..

709
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
餵
Yes.

710
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,910
是的
Yes.

711
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:14,920
是的

712
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
進來吧
Come inside.

713
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,440
什麼
What !

714
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
他們不讓你進？
They aren't letting you?

715
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,840
你為什麼總是穿短褲出門？
Why do you always come in boxers???

716
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,120
笨蛋
Dumbfuck!

717
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
怎麼了？
What happened ?

718
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,320
說話啊？
Tell me what happened ?

719
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,000
尤吉？
Yogi ?

720
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
我已經決定了
Okay, I have decided.

721
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,360
什麼？
What ?

722
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,400
我想等人齊了再說，我們一起去傑圖家吧
I want to tell you'll with Jeetu. Let's go to his place .

723
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,910
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing ?

724
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,360
尤吉給我發短信了，我得下去一趟
Yogi'd texted me. I am going down.

725
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
他們在停車場等我
They are waiting for me in the parking lot.

726
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,720
如果爸爸醒了，我該怎麼辦？
What will I answer dad if he gets up ?

727
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
拖2分鍾就好
Please handle it for 2mins..

728
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,960
求你了
Please..

729
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,830
求你了
Please.

730
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,960
好吧，你去吧
Okay, you go...

731
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,640
我拖住他
I will handle it.

732
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
他家三樓還是四樓？
Third floor or fourth floor ?

733
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,960
來了
Terrace !

734
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,120
別在這站著...-嘿，傑圖
Don't stand... -Hey jitu, hie..

735
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
不要站在這裏，這裏的保安是我爸爸的間諜
Don't stand over here, the watchman out here is my dad's spy.

736
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,250
- 你怎麼決定的?-曼達爾，把聲音調小點
Hmm, so what did you decide? Mandal, lower the volume.

737
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,770
你怎麼決定的，我們拿加裏的錢，對吧？
So what did you decide, we are taking money from Gary, right ?

738
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,870
這家夥什麼都冇告訴我們
This one's not telling us anything at all!

739
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,160
不，我們不拿他的錢
No, we aren't taking money from Gary.

740
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
事實上我已經給他發短信說”不”了
Infact I already texted him saying "No".

741
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
納文，這個決定背後的邏輯是什麼？
Naveen, what is the logic behind this ?

742
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
什麼邏輯，這是我們的想法，我們的努力
What logic, It's our idea our hardwork

743
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,360
我們花了這麼長的時間來研究它
We are working on it from such a long time

744
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,600
現在怎麼可以隨意的把一半股權給別人？
Now randomly we would give away half the stakes to somebody, why ?

745
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,870
他給我們錢啊，這就是為什麼，你還不明白嗎
He is giving us money, that's why, don't you get it..

746
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,680
這對我們公司的估值有很大幫助啊
How it helps our compnay's valuation!

747
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,840
我嚮你保證，在一年內我們能創造更多的價值
I guarantee you, in one year we will create more value than this .

748
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
納文
Naveen..

749
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,120
你是認真的嗎
Are you serious !

750
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
我們甚至都不能參加今天的活動了
We couldn't even go for today's event

751
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,380
別想募集資金了
Forget about raising funds...

752
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,400
投資者絕不會打電話給我們第二次機會
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

753
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,640
投資者絕不會打電話給我們第二次機會
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

754
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,840
你認為金主爸爸們會來……
You think Sikoya and Nexus will join hands...

755
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,470
求你接受他們的投資嗎
and beg you to take their investments ? !

756
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
求你接受他們的投資嗎
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

757
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,310
我們得妥協一下，納文
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

758
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
我們得妥協一下，納文

759
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
你們難道冇有意識到這個家夥是一個卑鄙的商人
Aren't you all realising that thios guy is a 'Bhujiyawaala'.

760
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
他甚至冇有技術背景
He doesn't even have a technical background..

761
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
他將會如何理解我們的産品？
How will he understand our product ?

762
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,600
這是優勢啊
That's the advantage.

763
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,520
如果他冇有任何技術背景
If he doesn't have any technical knowledge

764
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
他就不會幹涉的-如果他幹涉呢？
he won't interfere . -what if he interferes ?

765
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
那我們就完了
Then we're fucked.

766
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
我們以後再考慮這個問題
We'll think about it later..

767
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,600
你怎麼能獨自做出如此重要的決定呢？
And how can you take such an important decision by yourself?

768
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,200
就因為你的名片上寫著總裁
Just because you've C.E.O. on your visiting card...

769
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,720
並不意味著你就是老闆
... doesn't mean you are the boss.

770
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,360
納文
Naveen

771
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,790
我們是一個團隊
We are a team..

772
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,960
但是團隊裏冇有我
And there is no I in team.

773
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,830
兄弟們，不是這樣的
Guys it isn't that..

774
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,400
每次我在陪審室裏做出決定都是正確的
You know, whenever I've taken a decision in the jury room, it's always been right

775
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
是嗎？
yes？

776
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,720
你在陪審室裏到底是怎麼做的？
And what exactly do you do in the jury room ?

777
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,670
什麼？
What ?

778
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
我在問你
I am asking you!

779
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,000
你在陪審室裏是怎麼做決定的？
How do you take your decision in the jury room?

780
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
這很簡單
It's simple..

781
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:22,680
He must be listing down the pros and cons..

782
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
他一定是在列舉利弊
He must be listing down the pros and cons..

783
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,250
他一定是在列舉利弊

784
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,400
對其進行 SWAT 分析並確定可行性
Does a SWAT analysis of it and determines the probablity.

785
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,440
我在高中的時候也這樣做過
Even I have done that in the third semester of my high school

786
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
SWAT分析？
SWAT analysis ?..

787
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
可行性？
Probablity ?..

788
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,520
他他媽的扔了一枚硬幣然後就定了
He fucking tosses a coin and decides.

789
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,400
什麼
What !

790
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,840
就這樣？
Tosses and decides ?

791
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,200
納文，看著我
Naveen look here..

792
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,600
當年我娶桑亞的時候就是讓你做的決定啊！！
I had decided to marry saumya after asking you!

793
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,270
我不需要擲硬幣來決定
I didn't need to toss a coin for that.

794
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
但是你今天就需要？
But you needed it today?

795
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,480
你他媽的用硬幣決定了
You fucking decided four peoples carrer,ambition

796
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,280
四個人的事業，野心和未來！
and their future on the basis of tossing a coin !

797
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,000
如果是硬幣的另一麵呢？
And what if it was the other side of the coin ?

798
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,170
那麼我們現在是不是應該在加裏的農捨拍他馬屁?
Then right now we would have been in Gary's farmhouse licking his ass ? !

799
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,440
納文，你要下地獄我都跟你，但我不能跟隨1盧比的硬幣
Naveen I can follow you till hell but I can't follow a 1 Rupee coin.

800
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
納文我們都辭職了
Naveen, everyone has left their job...

801
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
這家創業公司是你的主意，對吧？
This startup was your idea, right ?

802
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
我們在你家每天連續工作16個小時
We are working 16 hrs continously at your home.

803
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
然而這位首席執行官擲硬幣做決定
And this CEO tosses a coin and decides.

804
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,440
至少你可以問我們一次？
Atleast you could have asked us once ?

805
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,770
這對你來說很難嗎
Was that asking for too much from you?

806
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,260
你投出來的是什麼? 正麵還是反麵?-我不知道
What was it Naveen? Head or tail ? - Guys I don't know what it was!

807
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,720
作出決定依據是拋硬幣的過程，而不是拋硬幣的結果
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing the coin, not on the result of it.

808
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,750
什麼意思？
What do you mean ?

809
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,750
就像這枚硬幣，生活給了我們兩個選擇..
Like this coin even life gives us 2 choices...

810
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,840
不管你列出多少贊成和反對的理由，雙方的幾率一定是平等的
No matter how many lists of pros and cons you make both sides would always be equal

811
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,230
而且你無法做出選擇
And you won't be able to pick any side.

812
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,200
這時你能做的就是傾聽你的心聲
That time all you can do is listen to your heart.

813
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,830
這就是為什麼如果你隻拋一次硬幣，你就會知道哪一麵朝上
That's why if you toss the coin once, you will come to know which side won.

814
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
但是你還冇看到它是正還是反？
But you didn't even see if it was a head or a tail ?

815
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,640
我不用看，已經聽到了
I didnt see it but I heard it.

816
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,470
當硬幣在空中的時候
When the coin stays in the air for half a second..

817
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,190
一個聲音從你的心底傳來……
A voice answers from the bottom of your heart...

818
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,320
說道：
Which says..

819
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
是正麵，是正麵
Please let it be heads, please heads!

820
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,830
這時你就會意識到不管硬幣是正麵還是反麵
That's when you realize no matter what the result is...

821
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
你的內心希望它是正麵的
Your heart wants it to be heads.

822
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,250
我意識到我們的第一筆投資不能建立在貪婪的基礎上
And I have realised that our first investment can't be set on the basis of greed.

823
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,620
加裏貪圖公平，而我們貪圖錢財
Where gary is in greed of equity and we of money

824
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
我們的第一筆投資應該是基於我們的..
Our first investment should be only on the basis of our...

825
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,600
創意與技術
Idea and skill.

826
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,680
如果隻是因為錢，那我不能讓任何人控製我的野心
Just for more funding I can't let anyone control my ambitions.

827
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,970
我真的很抱歉我不能這麼做
I am really sorry I could'nt do it.

828
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,760
現在你們想怎麼辦
Now you guys decide what to do.

829
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,800
我們要去哪兒？
Where are we going ?

830
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,000
回去繼續參加活動
Back to the event.

831
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,270
但是如果他們不讓我們進去呢
But what if they don't let us in!

832
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
那就用我們的一貫操作
The same thing what we always do ..

833
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
試試
Try.

834
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,310
我們走
Let's go.
