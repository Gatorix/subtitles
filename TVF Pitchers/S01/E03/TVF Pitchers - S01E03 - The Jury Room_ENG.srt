1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,950
Can I be part of your start-up?

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,570
Why?

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,720
Why. as in?

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,950
You all are engineers

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,990
You need an MBA

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,350
Naveen had called

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,700
Yogi and Naveen have quit their jobs and...

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,140
are planning a start up.

9
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,560
I feel you should join them

10
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,720
Anyhow, you have to speak to dad regarding this

11
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,380
I really want to be part of this

12
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,540
Unless you don't solve one of their problems

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,840
they don't need you

14
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,820
I know a coder, he is in 3rd year

15
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,920
Let's get him onboard. Trust me. He'll rock!

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,180
I looked into your idea

17
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,850
It's quite interesting actually

18
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,590
But, I haven't mailed you anything yet

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,730
Privacy on mail is a myth, my friend.

20
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,760
I think we need Jeetu

21
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,490
You think we need jeetu?

22
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,440
We need Jeetu.

23
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,710
I'll not be able to join. Sorry!

24
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,290
Why are you so scared of your Dad?

25
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,570
I can solve your problem

26
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,440
I can give you something which you need.

27
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,280
I can give you Jeetu.

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,580
Untill you find an investment

29
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,770
I'll pay for Jeetu's salary

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,920
Cheers!

31
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,720
and then "There were Four".

32
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
Ok. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

33
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,600
Your idea is very good.

34
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,810
I am going to U.S

35
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,390
As soon as I am back from U.S

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,330
We will start the investment process

37
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,640
Great!...

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,490
ok

39
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,260
That's..

40
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:23,700
wow..

41
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
So, zeeshan!

42
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,750
When do you return?

43
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,360
I am back in november 2016

44
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,100
November 2016..?

45
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,670
Yeah.. got some work

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,120
But you guys don't worry

47
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,320
A soon as I am back, we'll complete the funding and start the work

48
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,670
and mark my words

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,390
By quarter 3, 2030!

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,250
You will be number 1 in your verticle

51
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,900
2030?

52
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,180
Yes.. 2030!

53
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,100
You have to understand and get into the mind of the VC

54
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,900
they are all very rich guys

55
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,340
you have to suit up a little bit

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,810
You have to look a little professional

57
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,730
Boss! I think all that is bullshit!

58
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,540
Next time wear a t-shirt and slippers to meeting

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,920
Keep your feet on the table and tell him

60
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,470
write a cheque, or else I am leaving moth*rf**ker

61
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,850
Confidence is the key!

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,700
So, once we acquire enough users, we plan to raise a second round

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,710
We might even go mobile only. Just like Flat-Chat!

64
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,620
So, What do you think?

65
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,350
Gaurav!

66
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,370
Haan!

67
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
yes. One sec

68
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,350
Guys, you all are from 2011 batch. Right?

69
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,410
yes!

70
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,400
Do you guys know Shaina Oberoi?

71
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,750
Shaina Oberoi?

72
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,490
Do you guys have her number?

73
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,110
No?

74
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,580
How much funding do you need?

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,810
You have set it up well in two and a half years.

76
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,680
Investors were very excited about the idea of delivering Indian food to homes

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,450
and its very affordable

78
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,530
The meal that you are eating now costs Rs. 435

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Cool. Rs.435 for 3 plates.

80
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,290
Its Rs.435!

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
I have Rs.400

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,300
Be confident, place your foot on the table

83
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,450
I'll give you the funding.

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,780
like Now!

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,920
Be professional

86
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,630
Show me some Confidence!

87
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,970
What are you thinking?

88
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,310
Yes!

89
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,300
That's more like it. Boss!

90
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,320
What are you doing?

91
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,820
You will not get my money and

92
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,480
I will make sure no body funds you in Hiranandaani.

93
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
You don't keep your foot up.

94
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,240
He will. How will he not?

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,000
I lived in the silicon valley for 17 years

96
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,740
I have invested in like 5 companies there

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
But India

98
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,110
The fragrance of soil has dragged me to this country.

99
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,670
You know, I want do something Indian

100
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,180
we will make India's Uber

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,310
We call it "Induber".

102
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,360
You getting what Iam saying!

103
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,450
you see..

104
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,500
Why don't you have any females in your team?

105
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,190
You think woman are not on par with men

106
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,260
I started Zorpolo from scratch

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
and today, it's worth 50 f**king million

108
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,390
Why don't you have any female co-founders?

109
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,100
Come on join me.. come on.. what's wrong?

110
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,190
come on.. come on..

111
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,380
Getting a funding is equal to fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,560
Pandavas were 5 of them, though.

113
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,270
Now to win this war, what do you guys need?

114
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,220
Passion

115
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,970
Commitment

116
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
and Dedication

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,690
It was retorical

118
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,410
Ask what is needed?

119
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,220
What is needed Sir?

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,710
We need Shree Krishna!

121
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,270
Tell me, who is Arjun among you guys?

122
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,480
Arjun?

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:52,530
should be Jeetu? I can be Yudistir.

124
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,480
should be Jeetu? I can be Yudistir.

125
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,380
No Iam Yudistir, I never lie

126
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,650
You are Bheem? No.. Dibs on Bheem.

127
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,660
You are Sehdev

128
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
You are Bheem?

129
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,890
Naveen.. ya Naveen

130
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,850
Ya..I think it's me. Iam Arjun.

131
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,150
Hello Arjun

132
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,730
Ah..

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,930
In 1972

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,270
my gradfather started a small bhujiya shop on the streets of Bikaner

135
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,920
a small shop

136
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
and today

137
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,460
Weather its breakfast with tea or snacks with beer

138
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,170
it's only our brand, that people use

139
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,590
It's been 25 years, we are leading the market

140
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,860
also we were on the cover page of last month's Fortune magazine.

141
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,490
Despite of all this

142
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,730
Do you know what people call us behind our back?

143
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,890
What do they say?

144
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,650
Bhujiyawaala!

145
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,250
So that's why you want to expand to different sectors?

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,520
You are catching on..

147
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,750
I am putting my money on new ventures

148
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,770
Your product is very exciting

149
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,450
Perfect for our diversification.

150
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,620
I want to invest in you guys

151
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,540
That's great Gary

152
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,750
we actually wanted to dilute 15 to 20% of our equity

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,790
for around 1.2 to 1.6

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,530
You guys decide the number

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,430
I' ll decide the equity

156
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,890
I want atleast 51%

157
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,990
But sir 51% practically makes you the owner of the company

158
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,110
Company?

159
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,940
You mean.. four of you?

160
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
haan?

161
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,420
If one falls sick, you won't be having a proper teams to play carrom

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,290
Company!

163
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,250
Amount that you're asking for in the market

164
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,460
multiplied by 4

165
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,540
plus my brand

166
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,210
My contacts

167
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,630
Plus new office space

168
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,330
Its not a bad deal at all

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,860
Sir can we negotiate somewhere around 30-35%

170
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,550
I am not selling vegetables, you As*h*le

171
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,750
Ah! Gary, but this is a very difficult decision

172
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,350
we will think over it and let you know

173
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,540
like 51% is a lot

174
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,440
Shree Kriskna had asked Arjun, the blood of his own family members

175
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,930
I am just asking for a little more stake

176
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
nothing much.

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,690
Will talk about it on Sunday

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Parth.

179
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,110
Parth?

180
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,430
Naveen.

181
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,950
Parth!

182
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,780
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry... Sorry.

183
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,920
No no.. Please.

184
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,950
Go on..

185
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,500
I don't want to hold you back.

186
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,730
No.. I was thinking about Gary's proposal..

187
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,180
Naveen!

188
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,570
Do you realise we, meet like once a week now.

189
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,580
You'll be busy when I come to your place

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,790
Can't you talk to me for 5 minutes properly?

191
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm sorry. sorry!

192
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,240
Don't you think you have been saying sorry too often these days?

193
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,290
Iam sor....

194
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,120
Yeah maybe I am screwing up a lot these days

195
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,230
I am really sorry

196
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,220
I am really sorry

197
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,150
Naveen, Its not gonna work like this.

198
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,290
We need to talk..

199
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,800
I am sorry.. I am sorry..

200
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,610
Aww Baby.. You got scared?

201
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
Arey. It's not funny.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,730
Yogi was saying

203
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,180
Ashish brokeup the same way

204
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,290
He got busy with the startup

205
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,620
He got busy with the startup

206
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,790
he couldn't give time to his girlfriend

207
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
What nonsense!

208
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
such a cliche.

209
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
But cliches exists for a reason

210
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,600
Let us do some clihe?

211
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,310
Let's go to Goa.

212
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,680
What about your Bangalore trip?

213
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
I'll skip it

214
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,590
and moreover we dont even know when we get time after this weekend.

215
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,340
Don't be foolish and

216
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,320
ignore the job.

217
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,420
Your job stays with you for the next 30 years, even if I don't

218
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,780
just go to Bangalore

219
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,770
Lets go to Goa!

220
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:33,880
It's just a small project, anyway
It's just a small project, anyway

221
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,640
It's just a small project, anyway

222
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,280
Arey, its your work ya

223
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,250
Don't cheat your work!

224
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,390
Will go to Goa someother time.

225
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,310
Ok. What defines you better?

226
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,960
Business Consultant at Mckenzie or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

227
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,550
Tell me.

228
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,450
Ok fine.

229
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,980
I will go to Bangalore

230
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,630
Happy?

231
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,670
Very unromantic as*hole

232
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,730
What un-romantic as*hole

233
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,700
We can have fun here as well.

234
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,690
wanna drink something?

235
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,900
Ya.. One hazelnut cappucino and one Chicken tikka sandwich

236
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
One tea and two idlis please.

237
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
and dessert?

238
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,460
and what cigerrates do you have?

239
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,110
Goldflake. Sir

240
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,410
I have drawn the second FD too on wednesday.

241
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
Yogi is looking for loan

242
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,830
and don't know how much to depend on Mandal!

243
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,330
and about Gary's proposal

244
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,540
at times feel it's a necessity

245
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,270
and some times I feel its greed!

246
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,600
But you don't have to necessarily settle for Gary

247
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,300
Tomorrow, you have an event

248
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,680
won't there be potential investors?

249
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
there will be.. But..

250
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,590
may be for one last time.

251
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,390
We are running out of time, Shreya

252
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,540
If none of the investors show any interest in our tommorow's presentation

253
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,870
we might have to go with Gary

254
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,620
Did you try your Jury room approach?

255
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,650
No.. not yet.

256
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,840
What do your 3 stooges say?

257
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,550
Nothing as yet

258
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,760
They are banking on me to take the right decision.

259
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,630
That's getting me more scared

260
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,360
I could hug you right now

261
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,770
and say that you will be great

262
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,870
you will make the right decision

263
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,930
or

264
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,920
I could be less dramatic and tell you

265
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I believe in you Naveen Bansal

266
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Just like the 3 boys waiting for you at home.

267
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,880
Oh Shit!

268
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,770
What happened?

269
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,380
wait.. wait.. can I get a parcel..? 6 idli's, 2 chai...

270
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,820
Sir. Food got over.

271
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,200
Where is he still?

272
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,680
He said he will return in 15 minutes, its been 2 hours now.

273
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,750
asked me to wait just for a tea.

274
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,520
I need to go home and sleep

275
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,810
Yogi, call him now.

276
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,830
He left his phone here

277
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,400
we would have made tea here itself

278
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,890
If this as*hole wouldn't have used all the milk to set the curd

279
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,820
Tomorrow is an important day

280
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,280
How do we get lucky if we don't eat curd and sugar?

281
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,350
Shut up! You piece of crap

282
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,270
As*hole

283
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,890
For the last 6 hours you are only changing the font of Thank You.

284
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,640
Aey.. Aey.. Its very important to make a lasting impression. Ok!

285
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,700
Atleast I am not roaming around the city since morning

286
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,100
I had been to print visiting cards, you motherf*ckr

287
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,450
What do you do when you meet investors and they ask for contacts?

288
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,850
Guys, what's happening here?

289
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,630
Naveen, this is harrasement at work place

290
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,550
I can't work like this.

291
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,390
I can't tolerate this.

292
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,230
What you can't tolerate?

293
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,300
You 'll take my laptop to the room and jerk off watching Wolf of Wallstreet

294
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
No, I was preparing for the pitch.

295
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,740
I''ll kill you ba*t**d

296
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,200
You know what I saw on touchpad?

297
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,740
Yogi, what are you saying man?

298
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
We had to use sanitizer, Jeetu tell him.

299
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,600
Stop it.. Stop it Yogi.

300
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,380
Yogi, Behave your age.

301
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,850
You are bullying us since 10th standard.

302
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
Stop it now.

303
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,540
Madal, he's right. there's was something on the touchpad that day!

304
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,260
Jeetu! You are doubting me?

305
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,160
I swear, it was just curd.

306
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,290
Jeetu relax

307
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,290
we have an event tomorrow, don't be stressed.

308
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,740
You be quiet.

309
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
Do you even know what stress is?

310
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,270
Soumya is asking for watermelon from past 3 days

311
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
and I am not able to do it because

312
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,620
from past 2 days I am getting a compilation error

313
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,100
I am lying here since 2 days and I am exhausted doing this

314
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,430
I thought of having a good sleep today to be ready for tomorrow's event

315
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,740
But now you ruined it by coming two hours late

316
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,510
Now, the market at Borivali opens at 6am

317
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,710
I have to buy it from there.

318
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,650
Soumya will also ask me to get fresh fish also

319
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,200
So I need to carry watermelon in one hand and fish in the other

320
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,270
and travel in local train from Borivilli

321
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,830
because my bike is punctured and

322
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,680
no time to repair it because I am lying here since the last two days

323
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,840
Stress it seems.

324
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,530
Hold this!

325
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,150
Is breakfast ready?

326
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,400
Set it up quickly, please!

327
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,380
Did you read my message?

328
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,910
I don't have time now

329
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,610
I am already runing late by half an hour

330
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,220
I have to get fresh and leave.

331
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,570
Where are you going on Sunday morning, son?

332
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,170
Dad!

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,580
Arey No.. my nephew was saying

334
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,760
Vishwanathan Anand doesn't like fried idli at all

335
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,780
What?

336
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Ya seriously

337
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,560
Too much crowd..

338
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,820
These 24-25 years kids try to start the company as soon as they get out of college.

339
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,590
Half of them might not even know the spelling of entreprenuer

340
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,650
All virgin as*es!

341
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,360
That qeue looks smaller.

342
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,910
Is this the line for Registration?

343
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,530
No!

344
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,290
We are standing to pick up the ration

345
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,630
hahaha

346
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:34,940
As*hole

347
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,860
Do you know him?

348
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:39,860
whom?

349
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,990
That guy. Wanna be Zukerburg, Amit Awasti.

350
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,650
completed his B-Tech from NIT Hamirpur

351
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,620
but wears Harward T-shit to show-off

352
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,910
He is the founder of Litigator

353
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Litigator?

354
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,950
Its the social network for Lawyers.

355
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,530
They had issues with co-founder regarding equity last March

356
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,990
They used his own app to file a lawsuit against him

357
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,840
Do you recognise him?

358
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
who? John Snow?

359
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,720
who Snow?

360
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,360
That guy in black suit?

361
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,880
Oh..the guy in black suit?

362
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,070
Ya.

363
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,490
Ya.

364
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:14,870
haan.

365
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,730
No.

366
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,280
He is the founder of milkman.com, Ritwik mukherjee.

367
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,960
Okay.

368
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,560
Milkman. I've heard about it. Its like the Uber of dairy products

369
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,000
Dairy products my ass !

370
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,950
Its just an online stable.

371
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,910
In 2012, it started of with the name dudhwala.com...

372
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,240
but then government banned it thinking it's a porn website.

373
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,630
Now they have relaunched it with a new name.

374
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,200
By the way, I'm Saurabh Mandal.

375
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,960
This is Naveen Bansal

376
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,190
And yogi.

377
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
Hello sir.

378
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Do you have a VC ?

379
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,600
Visiting card ?

380
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
Yes, I do. Freshly baked .

381
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,800
Then give it.

382
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,120
Actually you meet a lot of frauds in such events.

383
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,960
Last time some asshole clicked a selfie saying "I am Rahul Yadav".

384
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,960
Later I got to know that asshole was just a B.com student from Mithibhai.

385
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Give it using two hands... With one hand is cnsidered unluncky!

386
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,850
You should be knowing all of this, we are of same age.

387
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,770
Take it.

388
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,250
ya.. like that

389
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,200
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

390
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,230
Hmm..

391
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,600
CEO, CTO, CMO

392
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,490
Founder, Superentreprenuer.com

393
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,460
This is my 8th company

394
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,690
and about those seven before this?

395
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,400
They were shut down.

396
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,890
Oh!

397
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,270
Oh!

398
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,100
But this one will take me to the list of Fortune 500

399
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Wait and Watch!

400
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,120
Thing is.. Hello..

401
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,470
So the thing is

402
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,430
The soul of entreprenuer is always restless.

403
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,950
It will roaming around untill you come up with a masterpiece.

404
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,850
So only 3 of you guys?

405
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,490
No sir..

406
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,440
No.. no. Its good.

407
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,360
The lesser number of co-founders, higher will be the equity value.

408
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,480
No sir, we are four of us. Jeetu is on his way

409
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,730
Yogi, call him and ask where did he reach?

410
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,750
Oho.. that's like 8% loss.

411
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,180
No problem, carry on!

412
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,300
Leave it Dad.

413
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,280
It's in the warranty

414
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,790
company guy will come and fix it for free.

415
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,430
haan. You studied computer science instead of mechanical

416
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,540
you might get tired to do all these stuffs

417
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
give me a bigger screw driver?

418
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,540
are you looking for app for it?

419
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
No.. no. Its about work

420
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,540
Watchen was saying..

421
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,270
You didn't come home for 2 days.

422
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
Actually Dad.

423
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,130
the company guys are making him work a lot

424
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,210
beacuse of the project

425
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
they call him daily, even on sundays

426
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,190
You get fresh

427
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
get ready

428
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,150
Dad, would you want to eat watermelon?

429
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,160
What kind of project do you have on Sunday's?

430
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,330
Call your boss and tell

431
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,190
Call your boss and tell

432
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,250
your dad has come from Bikaner, so can't come today.

433
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,330
give the phone, let me speak to him

434
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,510
Dad, It doesn't work that way.

435
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,200
have just come for a day

436
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,810
If not for Pandyaji's daughter wedding

437
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,230
I wouldn't have come.

438
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,900
Can't you have lunch with your dad for a day

439
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,630
your company won't shut down without you.

440
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,480
Yu have grown up now right!

441
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,420
nothing like that Dad.

442
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,260
I will just be back.

443
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,960
Hey! I am talking to you!

444
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,130
Send TTYL to your boss

445
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,300
Dad

446
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,830
Watermelon

447
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,710
Hello Yogi.

448
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,610
Yogi i can't come

449
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,980
All of a sudden dad showed up!

450
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,560
What nonsense?!

451
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,740
yes! He is not allowing me to leave.

452
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,590
Not allowing to leave?

453
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,730
Are you a 4th grader?

454
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Arey Yogi.

455
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,700
Jeetu?

456
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,380
Yes dad i am coming.

457
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,590
I am talking something important, and you are peeing?!

458
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,500
Just wait Yogi.

459
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
Jeetu?

460
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,160
The seminar is about end, post lunch is our main event.

461
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,110
Leave quickly!

462
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,880
Yogi I will talk to you later

463
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,730
Jeetu?

464
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
yes dad!

465
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,310
What is this?

466
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,940
looks like a boxer

467
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,850
it was stuck behind the tank

468
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,260
You don't even have time to keep your clothes in check.

469
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,180
and what were you doimg in the bathroom?

470
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,430
nothing.. phone...

471
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,550
I was peeing.

472
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,490
you will wash your hands after that or

473
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,410
anyone from the company will come to do it.

474
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm really really sorry sir, but this is the fourth time i'm telling you

475
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,660
that i can not give you the passes until the entire team registered

476
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
But madam you have to let us startup

477
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,150
This is our VC card

478
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
I am sorry sir. We have to follow certain guidelines.

479
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,240
See, listen...

480
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,280
Apoorva..

481
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,150
Apoorva, our friend is on his way.

482
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,960
Isn't it possible to first give us our three passes.

483
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Like, you can hold on to our friend's pass.

484
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,600
He will collect it from you, when he is here.

485
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,600
Let me check.

486
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,880
Naveen.

487
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,840
Naveen.

488
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Naveen..

489
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,150
Actually I

490
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,000
just found out that...

491
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
this is not a movie theatre...

492
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,630
and we cannot hold on to your passes.

493
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
But we have paid the registration fee....

494
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,670
1,857 Rupees per head.

495
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,720
Sir, you're holding the que, could you please step aside.

496
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,150
You can't do this to us...

497
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,920
I want to speak to the management.

498
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,520
How can she talk to us like this ?

499
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,960
I'll get you fired.

500
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Mark my words.

501
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,960
The battle has just begun.

502
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,280
The battle of 1,857 rupees.

503
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,520
Mangal and Pandey wont let her be.

504
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,630
Stop it.

505
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
What rubbish !

506
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
How can she talk to us like this.

507
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
Relax.

508
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
Let's figure out something.

509
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,190
Figure out what?

510
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
She has everyone's profiles.

511
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
We won't get entry without jitu

512
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
I told you, let's have sugar and curd before leaving.

513
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,430
Mandal, Please don't start again.

514
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Dont' answer.

515
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Answer.

516
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Hi Gary..

517
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,240
Gary, I am little busy, can I call you after sometime ?

518
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,710
There's still time for the presentation to start, Parth..

519
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
You're already busy ?

520
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
No Gary.

521
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
We just came here to see a friend.

522
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,400
One doesn't meet friends in such events...

523
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,680
You either meet your competition or investors!

524
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
Don't think of me as an idiot.

525
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,870
And Listen..

526
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
Put your phone on loudspeaker

527
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,630
Then you won't have to play Dumb charades.

528
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Ya.

529
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm not upset...

530
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,320
If I was in your place I would have done the same.

531
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,200
You should get a good value for a good product..

532
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,840
and there is no better place then such events to realize your product's value.

533
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
Gary, It is a good event but we're.....

534
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,840
In a hurry ? I know..

535
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,630
You have to meet a lot of investors...

536
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,600
have to discuss you're future plans

537
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
I know..

538
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,760
But before that, you dont want to listen to my new offer ?

539
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,430
New offer ?

540
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
I thought a lot..

541
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,150
Then I realised that this deal is little unfair for you..

542
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,920
So the amount which you guys had proposed?

543
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,600
Suffix a zero to the number.

544
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Gary..

545
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,720
That's a lot of money!

546
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
No.

547
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,670
You wanted a lot of money...

548
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
and I am giving you a lot of money X 10

549
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
But ofcourse...

550
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,720
Equity will be the same... 51%.

551
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,950
That is non-negotiable.

552
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm on my way to my lonavala farmhouse...

553
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,560
For a meeting.

554
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,240
Give me your answer before I get there...

555
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,400
Or the offer stands cancelled.

556
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
Or the offer stands cancelled.

557
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,320
And ya...

558
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,520
If you get an investor before that then..

559
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
All the best.

560
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,800
But Gary how will I reply so fast

561
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,670
Naveen you're beer

562
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,150
And I am snakcs!

563
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,360
If we both get together, we'll have a party!

564
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
I'll be waiting for your call...

565
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
Parth.

566
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
Did he just offer us...

567
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,440
Jitu always goes missing in such crucial times.

568
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,320
Mandal just text him once. -okay.

569
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,870
What are you thinking ?

570
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,290
I need a jury room.

571
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
Smells nice!

572
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Have you added ajwaine?

573
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,670
Yes papa.

574
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Salt water fish have a very unique taste..

575
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
They're very soft soft.

576
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,960
ya.

577
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,910
We don't get it over at our place!

578
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,760
I'll be back in two minutes.

579
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,280
Where are you going at lunch time ?

580
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,920
Just closeby to get some milk... Rgiht below the building!

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The milkman has already come in the morning!

582
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,120
Dad. I though I'll prepare some 'Rabdi' for you in the evening!

583
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
There was less milk so I asked him to.

584
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,800
Ya she asked me to.

585
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,480
Ya she asked me to.

586
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
But why do you need to go in this heat???

587
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,800
I will have it next time.

588
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
No Dad. It's no trouble. I insist.

589
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
Saumya makes nice 'rabdi'. I'll go get it in 2.

590
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,960
Wait a minute Jitu.

591
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,430
Sit over here.

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,360
Beta (daughter) listen.

593
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
Make me this concoction.

594
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
Papa, can I make it after lunch ?

595
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,670
No, the doctor has asked me to have it with lunch.

596
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
And listen.

597
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,360
Take your time and boil it for long!

598
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
There's no hurry.

599
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
Yes, Papa.

600
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,840
Tell me honestly.

601
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
Where were you going.

602
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
Papa, to buy milk, whatelse.

603
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,150
You were going to smoke a ciggarette.

604
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,240
Papa, I quit smoking in college.

605
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,560
Don't lie.

606
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,960
I've found a few in your office bag!

607
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,670
Papa..

608
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
How much should I lie for you ?

609
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
Before marriage...

610
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,280
Before marriage I had to lie to Parimal that you dont drink or smoke..

611
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,920
They married their daughter into our family because they had trust in us.

612
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,880
And you had promised your mom

613
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,760
That you would quit smoking!

614
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
Did you quit?

615
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
Okay, Sorry papa.

616
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,200
If you get desperate to smoke than have a chewing gum .

617
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,950
Hardiyal quit it the same way.

618
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,400
Okay Papa then I will go, get some mint from downstairs!

619
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Here.

620
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
Have it.

621
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
If you make one more sound

622
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,280
I will put castrol in your mouth and make you gargle it.

623
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,950
What are we waiting for ?

624
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,560
We are getting soo much money now!

625
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,880
If we take more time then even this plan will get ruined.

626
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,600
Naveen has the first right to take a decision.

627
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,800
Let him come out of the jury room.

628
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Then we will decide.

629
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,280
What is this jury room ?

630
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,200
I've been sseing it since our college time.

631
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,400
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

632
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

633
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,120
He locks himself in a room for 15 minutes.

634
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
And he comes out with the right decision.

635
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,560
And thats why we call it a jury room.

636
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,960
But in such a busy event, how did he find a empty room ?

637
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,520
This is the height of sexism.

638
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,120
What, were they not expecting female entreprenuers at all ?

639
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,360
Gents washroom is open but the female washroom is locked!

640
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,120
You will get a lot of mcps in such events.

641
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,920
You know what..

642
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,360
Even in my visiting card I have given my brothers number.

643
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
And how did you ?

644
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,760
If one Gandhiji can convice lacks of britishers ...

645
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,920
Why wouldn't a housekeeper get convinced with two!

646
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
You guys are still here ?

647
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Ya.

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Didn't go home?

649
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
Didn't go home?

650
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,670
Where is that CEO of your's ?

651
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
Actually that's who we are waiting for!

652
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,280
If you're wasting time...

653
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
Then follow me on twitter!

654
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,840
Ya ya..

655
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
I have 198 followers.

656
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
If you both follow me, then it'll become a double century.

657
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,440
Shit !

658
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,910
I have only 116...

659
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,960
But I have 312 followers on linkedIn.

660
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,880
312 ?

661
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Shit !

662
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,280
Just wait for my app to get launched..

663
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,280
Then watch how I overtake you.

664
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Why can't you go there and do your networking ?

665
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,270
Actually I am waiting for my roommate..

666
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,400
I forgot my keys.

667
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,230
I forgot my keys.

668
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
Even the other 7 are out.

669
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,440
So he is coming to give me the keys.

670
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
You'll are 9 people staying together?

671
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
4 BHK ?

672
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,390
No No..

673
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
It's a 2 BHK

674
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
But spacious enough.

675
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,280
800 sqft.

676
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,720
Actually

677
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,240
Since I got a divorced in 2008...

678
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,800
I've to live in a shared apartment!

679
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,520
It helps you build..

680
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Teamspirit.

681
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
You had a divorce ?

682
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
Yes.

683
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Sorry.

684
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,520
Why you're saying sorry ?

685
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,120
Why you're saying sorry ?

686
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
When she is not saying sorry..

687
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,200
Why you're saying sorry ?

688
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,050
It's okay.

689
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,680
Everyone is not that lucky to have a Sudhamurthi in their life.

690
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,920
Once my company gets funded...

691
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,920
Just wait and watch how 'Manglik' girls line up for me!

692
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,830
But in so many years you didn't get funded even once ?

693
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
I did..

694
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
In 2003 I did..

695
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,600
There was an investor who was ready to invest..

696
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,360
But was asking for 50% equity.

697
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,310
And our founder and CEO

698
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
Was sort of a buddha type..

699
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Said no to it .

700
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,720
Since then till today... I swear to god

701
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,600
The only time I have slept peacefully is while travelling in a train's sleeper class.

702
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,150
Ya karunesh..

703
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
Yes.

704
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,910
Yes.

705
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
Come inside.

706
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,440
What !

707
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
They aren't letting you?

708
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,840
Why do you always come in boxers???

709
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,120
Dumbfuck!

710
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
What happened ?

711
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,320
Tell me what happened ?

712
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,000
Yogi ?

713
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
Okay, I have decided.

714
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,360
What ?

715
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,400
I want to tell you'll with Jeetu. Let's go to his place .

716
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,910
What are you doing ?

717
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,360
Yogi'd texted me. I am going down.

718
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
They are waiting for me in the parking lot.

719
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,720
What will I answer dad if he gets up ?

720
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
Please handle it for 2mins..

721
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,960
Please..

722
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,830
Please.

723
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,960
Okay, you go...

724
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,640
I will handle it.

725
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
Third floor or fourth floor ?

726
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,960
Terrace !

727
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,120
Don't stand... -Hey jitu, hie..

728
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
Don't stand over here, the watchman out here is my dad's spy.

729
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,250
Hmm, so what did you decide? Mandal, lower the volume.

730
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,770
So what did you decide, we are taking money from Gary, right ?

731
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,870
This one's not telling us anything at all!

732
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,160
No, we aren't taking money from Gary.

733
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
Infact I already texted him saying "No".

734
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
Naveen, what is the logic behind this ?

735
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
What logic, It's our idea our hardwork

736
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,360
We are working on it from such a long time

737
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,600
Now randomly we would give away half the stakes to somebody, why ?

738
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,870
He is giving us money, that's why, don't you get it..

739
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,680
How it helps our compnay's valuation!

740
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,840
I guarantee you, in one year we will create more value than this .

741
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Naveen..

742
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,120
Are you serious !

743
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
We couldn't even go for today's event

744
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,380
Forget about raising funds...

745
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,400
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

746
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,640
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

747
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,840
You think Sikoya and Nexus will join hands...

748
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,470
and beg you to take their investments ? !

749
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

750
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,310
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

751
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
Aren't you all realising that thios guy is a 'Bhujiyawaala'.

752
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
He doesn't even have a technical background..

753
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
How will he understand our product ?

754
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,600
That's the advantage.

755
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,520
If he doesn't have any technical knowledge

756
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
he won't interfere . -what if he interferes ?

757
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
Then we're fucked.

758
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
We'll think about it later..

759
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,600
And how can you take such an important decision by yourself?

760
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,200
Just because you've C.E.O. on your visiting card...

761
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,720
... doesn't mean you are the boss.

762
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,360
Naveen

763
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,790
We are a team..

764
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,960
And there is no I in team.

765
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,830
Guys it isn't that..

766
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,400
You know, whenever I've taken a decision in the jury room, it's always been right

767
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
yes？

768
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,720
And what exactly do you do in the jury room ?

769
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,670
What ?

770
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
I am asking you!

771
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,000
How do you take your decision in the jury room?

772
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's simple..

773
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,240
He must be listing down the pros and cons..

774
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,400
Does a SWAT analysis of it and determines the probablity.

775
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Even I have done that in the third semester of my high school

776
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
SWAT analysis ?..

777
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Probablity ?..

778
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,520
He fucking tosses a coin and decides.

779
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,400
What !

780
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,840
Tosses and decides ?

781
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,200
Naveen look here..

782
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,600
I had decided to marry saumya after asking you!

783
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,270
I didn't need to toss a coin for that.

784
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
But you needed it today?

785
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,480
You fucking decided four peoples carrer,ambition

786
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,280
and their future on the basis of tossing a coin !

787
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,000
And what if it was the other side of the coin ?

788
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,170
Then right now we would have been in Gary's farmhouse licking his ass ? !

789
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,440
Naveen I can follow you till hell but I can't follow a 1 Rupee coin.

790
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
Naveen, everyone has left their job...

791
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
This startup was your idea, right ?

792
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
We are working 16 hrs continously at your home.

793
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
And this CEO tosses a coin and decides.

794
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,440
Atleast you could have asked us once ?

795
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,770
Was that asking for too much from you?

796
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,260
What was it Naveen? Head or tail ? - Guys I don't know what it was!

797
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,720
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing the coin, not on the result of it.

798
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,750
What do you mean ?

799
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,750
Like this coin even life gives us 2 choices...

800
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,840
No matter how many lists of pros and cons you make both sides would always be equal

801
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,230
And you won't be able to pick any side.

802
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,200
That time all you can do is listen to your heart.

803
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,830
That's why if you toss the coin once, you will come to know which side won.

804
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
But you didn't even see if it was a head or a tail ?

805
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,640
I didnt see it but I heard it.

806
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,470
When the coin stays in the air for half a second..

807
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,190
A voice answers from the bottom of your heart...

808
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,320
Which says..

809
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Please let it be heads, please heads!

810
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,830
That's when you realize no matter what the result is...

811
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
Your heart wants it to be heads.

812
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,250
And I have realised that our first investment can't be set on the basis of greed.

813
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,620
Where gary is in greed of equity and we of money

814
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
Our first investment should be only on the basis of our...

815
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,600
Idea and skill.

816
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,680
Just for more funding I can't let anyone control my ambitions.

817
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,970
I am really sorry I could'nt do it.

818
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,760
Now you guys decide what to do.

819
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,800
Where are we going ?

820
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,000
Back to the event.

821
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,270
But what if they don't let us in!

822
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,400
The same thing what we always do ..

823
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
Try.

824
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,310
Let's go.
