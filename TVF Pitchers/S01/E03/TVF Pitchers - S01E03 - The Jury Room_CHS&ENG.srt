除非你能解决他们的问题

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,950

你们要穿得正式一点

看起来更专业一点

60
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,540
下次开会时穿 t 恤和拖鞋

你拿不到我的钱

我会保证不会有人给你融资

为什么你的团队里没有女性？

我白手起家创办了佐波罗

109
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,560
今天，市值五千万
and today, it's worth 50 f**king million

110
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,390
你们为什么没有女性联合创始人？

113
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,380
融资的过程就好似一场摩诃婆罗多之战
Getting a funding is equal to fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

114
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,560
虽然班度五子有五个人

115
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,270
为了赢得这场战争，你们需要什么？

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,270

1972年

also we were on the cover page of last month's Fortune magazine.

143
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,490
尽管如此
Despite of all this

144
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,730
你知道人们在背后怎么称呼我们吗？
Do you know what people call us behind our back?

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,890
他们说你什么？
What do they say?

146
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,650
布吉亚瓦拉（臭名昭著的印度食品品牌）
Bhujiyawaala!

147
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,250
这就是你想扩张到不同领域的原因吗？
So that's why you want to expand to different sectors?

148
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,520
你越来越明白了
You are catching on..

149
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,750
我要把我的钱投资在新的冒险上
I am putting my money on new ventures

150
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,770
你们的产品很令人兴奋
Your product is very exciting

151
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,450
非常适合我们的多样化经营
Perfect for our diversification.

152
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,620
我想在你们身上投资
I want to invest in you guys

153
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,540
太好了，加里
That's great Gary

154
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,750
实际上我们想稀释15% 到20% 的股权
we actually wanted to dilute 15 to 20% of our equity

155
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,790
融资在120万到160万之间
for around 1.2 to 1.6

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,530
你们来决定金额
You guys decide the number

157
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,430
我来决定股权结构
I' ll decide the equity

158
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,890
我至少要51%
I want atleast 51%

159
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,990
但是先生，51% 的股份就等于你成了我们公司的老板
But sir 51% practically makes you the owner of the company

160
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,110
公司？
Company?

161
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,940
你是说... 你们四个？
You mean.. four of you?

162
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
哈？
haan?

163
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,420
如果你们有一个人生病了，就连桌麻将都凑不齐
If one falls sick, you won't be having a proper teams to play carrom

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,290
还公司呢
Company!

165
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,250
你们的市场价格
Amount that you're asking for in the market

166
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,460
乘以4
multiplied by 4

167
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,540
再加上我的品牌
plus my brand

168
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,210
我的人脉
My contacts

169
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,630
还有办公室
Plus new office space

170
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,330
这完全不是一笔坏交易
Its not a bad deal at all

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,860
先生，您能降低到30-35% 吗
Sir can we negotiate somewhere around 30-35%

172
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,550
我不是来买菜的，混蛋
I am not selling vegetables, you As*h*le

173
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,750
那个…… 加里，这是一个非常困难的决定
Ah! Gary, but this is a very difficult decision

174
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,350
我们会仔细考虑，然后告诉你
we will think over it and let you know

175
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,540
51% 已经很多了
like 51% is a lot

176
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,440
克里斯克先生曾经问过亲人阿俊
Shree Kriskna had asked Arjun, the blood of his own family members

177
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,930
我只是想要更多的股权
I am just asking for a little more stake

178
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
没其他的了
nothing much.

179
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,690
我们星期天再谈
Will talk about it on Sunday

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
帕斯
Parth.

181
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,110
帕斯？
Parth?

182
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,430
我叫纳文
Naveen.

183
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,950
帕斯
Parth!

184
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,780
对不起! 对不起! 对不起... 对不起
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry... Sorry.

185
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,920
不用，你自己走吧
No no.. Please.

186
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,950
走啊
Go on..

187
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,500
我不想拖你的后腿
I don't want to hold you back.

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,730
不，我在考虑加里的提议
No.. I was thinking about Gary's proposal..

189
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,180
纳文
Naveen!

190
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,570
你知道吗，我们现在差不多一周才见一次面
Do you realise we, meet like once a week now.

191
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,580
我去你家的时候你都很忙
You'll be busy when I come to your place

192
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,790
你就不能和我好好聊5分钟吗？
Can't you talk to me for 5 minutes properly?

193
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,840
对不起，对不起
I'm sorry. sorry!

194
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,240
你不觉得这些天你说对不起太频繁了吗？
Don't you think you have been saying sorry too often these days?

195
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,290
对不..
Iam sor....

196
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,120
是啊，最近我搞砸了很多事情
Yeah maybe I am screwing up a lot these days

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,230
我真的很抱歉
I am really sorry

198
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,220
我真的很抱歉
I am really sorry

199
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,150
纳文，这样不行
Naveen, Its not gonna work like this.

200
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,290
我们得谈谈
We need to talk..

201
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,800
对不起对不起
I am sorry.. I am sorry..

202
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,610
宝贝，你害怕了？
Aww Baby.. You got scared?

203
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
一点都不好笑
Arey. It's not funny.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,730
尤吉说
Yogi was saying

205
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,180
艾什就是这么分手的
Ashish brokeup the same way

207
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,620
他忙于创业
He got busy with the startup

208
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,790
没时间陪女朋友
he couldn't give time to his girlfriend

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
胡说八道
What nonsense!

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
真是陈词滥调
such a cliche.

211
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
但是陈词滥调的存在是有原因的
But cliches exists for a reason

212
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,600
让我们来点刺激的？
Let us do some clihe?

213
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,310
我们去果阿吧
Let's go to Goa.

214
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,680
你的班加罗尔之旅怎么办？
What about your Bangalore trip?

215
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
我不去了
I'll skip it

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,590
而且我们甚至不知道这个周末后我们什么时候有时间
and moreover we dont even know when we get time after this weekend.

217
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,340
别犯傻了
Don't be foolish and

218
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,320
暂时忘掉工作吧
ignore the job.

219
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,420
在接下来的30年里，就算我不陪着你了，你的工作也会一直伴随着你
Your job stays with you for the next 30 years, even if I don't

220
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,780
去班加罗尔吧

我们去果阿吧
Lets go to Goa!

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:33,880
It's just a small project, anyway
It's just a small project, anyway

223
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,640
无论如何，这只是一个小项目
It's just a small project, anyway

224
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,280
这是你的工作
Arey, its your work ya

225
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,250
不要欺骗你的工作
Don't cheat your work!

226
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,390
改天再去果阿
Will go to Goa someother time.

227
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,310
好啊，那你以什么身份去？
Ok. What defines you better?

228
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,960
麦肯锡的商业顾问还是纳文·班萨尔的女朋友？

229
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,550

我去班加罗尔
I will go to Bangalore

232
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,630
高兴了吧
Happy?

233
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,670
一点都不浪漫
Very unromantic as*hole

234
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,730
什么不浪漫啊
What un-romantic as*hole

235
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,700
我们在这里也可以玩得很开心
We can have fun here as well.

236
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,690
想喝点什么吗？

237
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,900
一份榛子卡普奇诺和一份鸡肉三明治

甜点呢？

你这有什么烟？

241
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,110
戈德弗雷克，先生

242
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,410
周三，我画出了第二幅 FD
I have drawn the second FD too on wednesday.

243
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,680
尤吉正在寻找贷款
Yogi is looking for loan

244
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,830
不知道还要依赖曼达尔多久
and don't know how much to depend on Mandal!

245
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,330
关于加里的提议
and about Gary's proposal

246
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,540
有时觉得这是必须的
at times feel it's a necessity

247
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,270
有时我又觉得很贪婪
and some times I feel its greed!

248
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,600
但是你不一定要满足于加里
But you don't have to necessarily settle for Gary

249
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,300
明天你有个活动
Tomorrow, you have an event

250
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,680
不会有潜在的投资者吗？
won't there be potential investors?

251
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
会有... 但是..
there will be.. But..

252
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,590
也许这是最后一次了
may be for one last time.

253
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,390
我们没时间了，史瑞雅
We are running out of time, Shreya

254
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,540
如果没有一个投资者对我们明天的展示感兴趣
If none of the investors show any interest in our tommorow's presentation

255
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,870
我们可能只有加里这一条路了
we might have to go with Gary

256
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,620
你有没有试过庭审的方法？
Did you try your Jury room approach?

257
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,650
不，还没有
No.. not yet.

258
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,840
你的三个合伙人怎么说？
What do your 3 stooges say?

259
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,550
目前都还没有说什么
Nothing as yet

260
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,760
他们指望我做出正确的决定
They are banking on me to take the right decision.

261
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,630
这让我更害怕了
That's getting me more scared

262
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,360
我现在就可以拥抱你
I could hug you right now

263
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,770
说你会成功的
and say that you will be great

264
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,870
你会做出正确的决定
you will make the right decision

265
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,930
或者
or

266
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,920
我可以不那么夸张地告诉你
I could be less dramatic and tell you

267
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,120
我相信你 纳文巴萨尔
I believe in you Naveen Bansal

268
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,100
和在家里等你的那三个男孩一样
Just like the 3 boys waiting for you at home.

269
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,880
哦，该死
Oh Shit!

270
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,770
发生了什么？
What happened?

271
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,380
等等，等等，我能打包吗? 6个点心，2杯茶..
wait.. wait.. can I get a parcel..? 6 idli's, 2 chai...

272
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,820
先生，我收摊了
Sir. Food got over.

273
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,200
他怎么还不回来？
Where is he still?

274
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,680
他说他15分钟后回来，现在已经两个小时了
He said he will return in 15 minutes, its been 2 hours now.

275
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,750
叫我等一下喝杯茶
asked me to wait just for a tea.

276
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,520
我得回家睡觉了
I need to go home and sleep

277
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,810
尤基，现在就给他打电话
Yogi, call him now.

278
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,830
他把手机落在这儿了
He left his phone here

279
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,400
我们可以在这里自己泡茶
we would have made tea here itself

280
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,890
如果这个沙雕没有把所有的牛奶来凝乳
If this as*hole wouldn't have used all the milk to set the curd

281
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,820
明天是个重要的日子
Tomorrow is an important day

282
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,280
如果我们不吃凝乳和糖，我们怎么会走运呢？
How do we get lucky if we don't eat curd and sugar?

283
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,350
闭嘴! 你这个废物
Shut up! You piece of crap

284
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,270
沙雕
As*hole

285
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,890
在过去的6个小时里，你唯一的作用就是更改了谢谢的字体
For the last 6 hours you are only changing the font of Thank You.

286
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,640
留下一个持久的印象是很重要的
Aey.. Aey.. Its very important to make a lasting impression. Ok!

287
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,700

Atleast I am not roaming around the city since morning

288
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,100
我去印名片了，你这个混蛋
I had been to print visiting cards, you motherf*ckr

289
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,450
当你和投资者见面时，他们要求联系你，你会怎么做？
What do you do when you meet investors and they ask for contacts?

290
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,850
伙计们，这是怎么回事？
Guys, what's happening here?

291
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,630
纳文， 这是办公室骚扰
Naveen, this is harrasement at work place

292
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,550
我不能这样工作
I can't work like this.

293
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,390
我不能容忍这种事
I can't tolerate this.

294
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,230
你不能忍受什么？
What you can't tolerate?

295
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,300
你会把我的笔记本电脑带到房间然后看着华尔街之狼打飞机
You 'll take my laptop to the room and jerk off watching Wolf of Wallstreet

296
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
不，我是在准备演讲
No, I was preparing for the pitch.

297
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,740
老子搞死你
I''ll kill you ba*t**d

298
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,200
你知道我在触摸板上看到了什么吗？
You know what I saw on touchpad?

299
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,740
尤吉，你在说什么？
Yogi, what are you saying man?

300
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,580
我们都用上了消毒剂，杰图你跟他说
We had to use sanitizer, Jeetu tell him.

301
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,600
别这样，尤吉
Stop it.. Stop it Yogi.

302
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,380
尤吉，注意你的年龄
Yogi, Behave your age.

303
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,850
你从10年级开始就在欺负我们
You are bullying us since 10th standard.

304
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
别说了
Stop it now.

305
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,540
曼达尔，他说得对，那天触摸板上有东西
Madal, he's right. there's was something on the touchpad that day!

306
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,260
杰图! 你在怀疑我吗？
Jeetu! You are doubting me?

307
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,160
我发誓，那只是凝乳
I swear, it was just curd.

308
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,290
杰图 放松
Jeetu relax

309
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,290
我们明天有活动，别紧张
we have an event tomorrow, don't be stressed.

310
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,740
你安静点
You be quiet.

311
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
你知道什么是压力吗？
Do you even know what stress is?

312
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,270
桑亚三天之前想吃西瓜
Soumya is asking for watermelon from past 3 days

313
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,760
我不能买给她是因为
and I am not able to do it because

314
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,620
过去两天我都在处理一个编译错误
from past 2 days I am getting a compilation error

315
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,100
我已经在这里待两天了，已经筋疲力尽了
I am lying here since 2 days and I am exhausted doing this

316
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,430
我想今天好好睡一觉，为明天的活动做好准备
I thought of having a good sleep today to be ready for tomorrow's event

317
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,740
但现在你迟到了两个小时，把一切都毁了
But now you ruined it by coming two hours late

318
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,510
现在包里瓦利市场早上6点开市
Now, the market at Borivali opens at 6am

319
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,710
我得去那里买

320
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,650
桑亚还要叫我去买新鲜的鱼
Soumya will also ask me to get fresh fish also

321
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,200
所以我需要一手拿着西瓜，一手拿着鱼
So I need to carry watermelon in one hand and fish in the other

322
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,270
然后从包里瓦利坐火车
and travel in local train from Borivilli

323
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,830
因为我的自行车轮胎被扎破了
because my bike is punctured and

324
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,680
我没有时间去修，因为我已经待在这里两天了
no time to repair it because I am lying here since the last two days

325
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,840
强调一下
Stress it seems.

326
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,530
接一下
Hold this!

327
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,150
早餐准备好了吗？
Is breakfast ready?

328
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,400
麻烦快一点
Set it up quickly, please!

329
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,380
你看到我的信息了吗？
Did you read my message?

330
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,910
我还没时间看
I don't have time now

331
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,610
我已经迟到半小时了
I am already runing late by half an hour

332
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,220
我得收拾一下赶紧走了
I have to get fresh and leave.

333
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,570
星期天早上你要去哪儿，孩子？
Where are you going on Sunday morning, son?

334
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,170
爸爸

335
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,580
不是的，我侄子说
Arey No.. my nephew was saying

维斯瓦纳坦 · 阿南德根本不喜欢油炸伊德利
Vishwanathan Anand doesn't like fried idli at all

337
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,780
什么？

338
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
说真的
Ya seriously

339

340

这些二十四五岁的孩子一毕业就想开公司
These 24-25 years kids try to start the company as soon as they get out of college.

341
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,590
他们中的一半甚至可能都不知道企业家怎么拼写
Half of them might not even know the spelling of entreprenuer

342
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,650

345
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,530

我们在这等着领通行证

你认识他吗？

They had issues with co-founder regarding equity last March

358
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,990

but then government banned it thinking it's a porn website.

375

Last time some asshole clicked a selfie saying "I am Rahul Yadav".

企业家的灵魂总是不安分的

405
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,950
它会一直游荡，直到你想出一个杰作

不，不，很好

The lesser number of co-founders, higher will be the equity value.

410
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,480

尤吉，打电话问他在哪里？

好吧 那就是8% 的损失

413
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,180
没问题，继续

414
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,300
算了吧，爸爸
Leave it Dad.

417
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,430
你学的是计算机科学而不是机械
haan. You studied computer science instead of mechanical

418
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,540
你可能会厌倦做这些事情
you might get tired to do all these stuffs

419
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
给我一个更大的螺丝刀？

420
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,450
尤吉：你在哪里

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,540
你手机里有螺丝刀吗？
are you looking for app for it?

422
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,740
不，不，是关于工作的
No.. no. Its about work

423
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,540
瓦钦说

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,270
你两天没回家了
You didn't come home for 2 days.

425
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
是这样的，爸爸
Actually Dad.

426
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,130
公司的人让他加班
the company guys are making him work a lot

427
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,210
因为这个项目
beacuse of the project

428
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,800
他们每天都给他打电话，星期天都不让休息

429
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,190
你去收拾一下

430
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
准备好

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,150
爸爸，你想吃西瓜吗？
Dad, would you want to eat watermelon?

432
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,160
你们星期天有什么项目？
What kind of project do you have on Sunday's?

433
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,330
打电话告诉你老板

434
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,190
打电话告诉你老板
Call your boss and tell

435
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,250
你爸爸从比卡内尔来看你，所以今天不能加班
your dad has come from Bikaner, so can't come today.

436
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,330
把电话给我，让我跟你老板说
give the phone, let me speak to him

437
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,510
爸爸，事情不是这样的
Dad, It doesn't work that way.

438
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,200
我只待一天

439
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,810
如果不是为了潘迪亚吉女儿的婚礼

440
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,230
我才不来
I wouldn't have come.

441
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,900
你就不能和你爸爸吃个午饭吗
Can't you have lunch with your dad for a day

442
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,630
没有你，你的公司不会倒闭的
your company won't shut down without you.

443
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,480
现在翅膀这么硬了吗

444
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,420
不是那样的，爸爸

00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,260
我马上回来

00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,960
嘿! 我在跟你说话呢

447
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,130
给你老板回复一句等会再说

喂，尤吉
Hello Yogi.

451
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,610
尤吉，我不能去了
Yogi i can't come

452
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,980
我爸突然来我家了
All of a sudden dad showed up!

453
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,560
什么?
What nonsense?!

454
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,740
是的! 他不让我走
yes! He is not allowing me to leave.

455
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,590
不让走？
Not allowing to leave?

456
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,730
你是四年级学生吗？
Are you a 4th grader?

457
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
唉……尤吉
Arey Yogi.

458
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,700
杰图？
Jeetu?

459
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,380
好的，爸爸，我来了
Yes dad i am coming.

460
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,590
我在说重要的事，你却在撒尿?
I am talking something important, and you are peeing?!

461
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,500
等等吧，尤吉
Just wait Yogi.

462
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
杰图？
Jeetu?

463
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,160
研讨会快结束了，午餐后的活动很关键
The seminar is about end, post lunch is our main event.

464
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,110
快点过来
Leave quickly!

465
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,880
尤吉，我一会儿再和你谈
Yogi I will talk to you later

466
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,730
杰图？
Jeetu?

467
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
是的，爸爸
yes dad!

468
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,310
这是什么？
What is this?

469
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,940
看起来像一条内裤
looks like a boxer

470
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,850
它卡在水箱后面了
it was stuck behind the tank

471
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,260
你都没有时间检查下洗了多少衣服吗
You don't even have time to keep your clothes in check.

472
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,180
你在洗手间干什么？
and what were you doimg in the bathroom?

473
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,430
没什么，电话..
nothing.. phone...

474
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,550
我在小便
I was peeing.

475
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,490
小便之后你要洗手
you will wash your hands after that or

476
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,410
不然公司的人都会开始不洗手
anyone from the company will come to do it.

477
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:56,800
真的非常抱歉，但这是我第四次告诉您
I'm really really sorry sir, but this is the fourth time i'm telling you

478
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,660
除非团队人到齐了，否则我不能给你们通行证
that i can not give you the passes until the entire team registered

479
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
但是你总得让我们创业啊
But madam you have to let us startup

480
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,150
这是我们的名片
This is our VC card

481
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
对不起，先生，我们必须遵守一些规定
I am sorry sir. We have to follow certain guidelines.

482
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,240
听着
See, listen...

483
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,280
阿普尔瓦
Apoorva..

484
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,150
阿普尔瓦，我们的朋友在路上了
Apoorva, our friend is on his way.

485
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,960
难道不能先给我们三张通行证吗
Isn't it possible to first give us our three passes.

486
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
朋友的通行证等他到了你再给他
Like, you can hold on to our friend's pass.

487
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,600
他到的时候来找你拿
He will collect it from you, when he is here.

488
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,600
让我看看
Let me check.

489
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,880
纳文
Naveen.

490
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,840
纳文
Naveen.

491
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
纳文……
Naveen..

492
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,150
其实我
Actually I

493
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,000
刚刚发现..
just found out that...

494
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,120
这里不是电影院
this is not a movie theatre...

495
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,630
我们不能帮忙保管通行证
and we cannot hold on to your passes.

496
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,960
但是我们已经付了注册费..
But we have paid the registration fee....

497
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,670
每人1857卢比
1,857 Rupees per head.

498
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,720
先生，麻烦你靠边站
Sir, you're holding the que, could you please step aside.

499
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,150
你不能这样对我们..
You can't do this to us...

500
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,920
你找你领导出来
I want to speak to the management.

501
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,520
她怎么能这样跟我们说话？
How can she talk to us like this ?

502
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,960
我会让你被炒鱿鱼的
I'll get you fired.

503
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
记住我的话
Mark my words.

504
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,960
战斗才刚刚开始
The battle has just begun.

505
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,280
一场1857卢比的战争
The battle of 1,857 rupees.

506
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,520
诸神不会放过她的
Mangal and Pandey wont let her be.

507
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,630
别说了
Stop it.

508
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
什么人啊
What rubbish !

509
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,280
她怎么能这样跟我们说话
How can she talk to us like this.

510
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
放松
Relax.

511
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,000
让我们想想办法
Let's figure out something.

512
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,190
还有什么办法？
Figure out what?

513
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,800
她有每个人的档案
She has everyone's profiles.

514
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
杰图不来我们就进不去
We won't get entry without jitu

515
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,400
早就说了，走之前我们应该吃点糖和豆腐吧
I told you, let's have sugar and curd before leaving.

516
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,430
曼达尔，你快别bb了
Mandal, Please don't start again.

517
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
不要回答
Dont' answer.

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
回答
Answer.

519
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
嗨，加里
Hi Gary..

520
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,240
加里，我现在有点忙，过会儿我再打电话给你行吗？
Gary, I am little busy, can I call you after sometime ?

521
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,710
演讲还没开始呢
There's still time for the presentation to start, Parth..

522
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,520
你就已经开始忙了？
You're already busy ?

523
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,400
不是，我没有，加里
No Gary.

524
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,360
我们只是来看朋友的
We just came here to see a friend.

525
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,400
在这种场合不会遇到朋友
One doesn't meet friends in such events...

526
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,680
你要么遇到竞争对手，要么遇到投资者
You either meet your competition or investors!

527
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
别把我当傻瓜
Don't think of me as an idiot.

528
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,870
听着
And Listen..

529
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
你把免提打开
Put your phone on loudspeaker

530
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,630
这样你就不用比划了
Then you won't have to play Dumb charades.

531
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
好
Ya.

532
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,640
我没有生气..
I'm not upset...

533
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,320
如果我是你，我也会这么做的
If I was in your place I would have done the same.

534
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,200
你应该为你们的产品争取一个好价钱
You should get a good value for a good product..

535
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,840
没有比这更好的地方来实现你的产品价值了
and there is no better place then such events to realize your product's value.

536
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,600
加里，这是个好活动，但是我们..
Gary, It is a good event but we're.....

537
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,840
赶时间? 我知道
In a hurry ? I know..

538
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,630
你得见很多投资者..
You have to meet a lot of investors...

539
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,600
讨论一下你们的未来计划
have to discuss you're future plans

540
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,560
我知道
I know..

541
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,760
但在那之前，你不想听听我的新提议吗？
But before that, you dont want to listen to my new offer ?

542
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,430
新的提议？
New offer ?

543
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,680
我想了很多
I thought a lot..

544
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,150
然后我意识到这笔交易对你们有点不公平
Then I realised that this deal is little unfair for you..

545
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,920
所以我们这样，在你们的报价后面……
So the amount which you guys had proposed?

546
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,600
加一个零
Suffix a zero to the number.

547
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
加里
Gary..

548
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,720
那可是一大笔钱
That's a lot of money!

549
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
没错
No.

550
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,670
你想要很多钱..
You wanted a lot of money...

551
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,600
我现在就给你钱，十倍哦
and I am giving you a lot of money X 10

552
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,680
但是当然..
But ofcourse...

553
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,720
股本将是相同的... 51%
Equity will be the same... 51%.

554
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,950
这没有商量的余地
That is non-negotiable.

555
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,160
我正要去我的罗纳瓦拉农舍
I'm on my way to my lonavala farmhouse...

556
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,560
参加会议
For a meeting.

557
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,240
在我到达之前给我你的答案..
Give me your answer before I get there...

558
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:23,400
否则交易取消
Or the offer stands cancelled.

559
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,560
否则交易取消
Or the offer stands cancelled.

560
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,320
另外……
And ya...

561
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,520
如果你在那之前找到投资者的话……
If you get an investor before that then..

562
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,720
祝你一切顺利
All the best.

563
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,800
但是加里，我怎么能这么快回复你呢
But Gary how will I reply so fast

564
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,670
纳文，你是啤酒
Naveen you're beer

565
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,150
而我是蛇
And I am snakcs!

566
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,360
如果我们两个聚在一起，会很热闹的
If we both get together, we'll have a party!

567
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
我会等你的电话..
I'll be waiting for your call...

568
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,240
帕斯
Parth.

569
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,600
他刚才是不是给我们……
Did he just offer us...

570
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,440
在这样的关键时刻，杰图总是不见踪影
Jitu always goes missing in such crucial times.

571
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,320
曼达尔再给他发一次短信-好的
Mandal just text him once. -okay.

572
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:51,870
你怎么想
What are you thinking ?

573
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,290
我需要一个陪审室
I need a jury room.

574
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,520
闻起来真香
Smells nice!

575
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
你加味精了吗？
Have you added ajwaine?

576
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,670
是的，爸爸
Yes papa.

577
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
海鱼有一种很独特的味道
Salt water fish have a very unique taste..

578
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,240
很柔软
They're very soft soft.

579
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,960
是啊
ya.

580
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,910
我们那就吃不到
We don't get it over at our place!

581
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,820
加里提出10倍价格收购我们的项目，他要马上给答复，给我回电话快点

582
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,760
我两分钟后回来
I'll be back in two minutes.

583
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,280
吃着饭呢你要去哪里？
Where are you going at lunch time ?

584
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,920
就在附近买点牛奶... 楼下
Just closeby to get some milk... Rgiht below the building!

585
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
送牛奶的早上已经来了
The milkman has already come in the morning!

586
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,120
爸爸，我想我晚上会给你准备一些拉比
Dad. I though I'll prepare some 'Rabdi' for you in the evening!

587
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
牛奶少了，所以我让他去买
There was less milk so I asked him to.

588
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,800
是的，她让我这么做的
Ya she asked me to.

589
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,480
是的，她让我这么做的
Ya she asked me to.

590
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,240
但是你为什么要在这么热的天气里出去呢？
But why do you need to go in this heat???

591
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,800
我下次会吃的
I will have it next time.

592
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,600
不，爸爸，不麻烦，我坚持
No Dad. It's no trouble. I insist.

593
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
桑娅做的腊肠很好吃，我2分钟就回来
Saumya makes nice 'rabdi'. I'll go get it in 2.

594
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,960
等一下，杰图
Wait a minute Jitu.

595
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,430
回来坐下
Sit over here.

596
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,360
闺女过来
Beta (daughter) listen.

597
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,100
去把这药给我煎了
Make me this concoction.

598
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
爸爸，我可以在午饭后去吗？
Papa, can I make it after lunch ?

599
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,670
不行，医生让我午饭时吃
No, the doctor has asked me to have it with lunch.

600
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
听好了
And listen.

601
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,360
慢慢来，慢慢煮
Take your time and boil it for long!

602
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
不用着急
There's no hurry.

603
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,680
好的，爸爸
Yes, Papa.

604
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,840
老实告诉我
Tell me honestly.

605
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
你要去哪里
Where were you going.

606
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
爸爸，去买牛奶，还有什么
Papa, to buy milk, whatelse.

607
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,150
你是要去抽烟吧
You were going to smoke a ciggarette.

608
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,240
爸爸，我在大学里就戒烟了
Papa, I quit smoking in college.

609
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,560
不要撒谎
Don't lie.

610
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,960
我在你公文包里找到了几根烟
I've found a few in your office bag!

611
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,670
爸爸
Papa..

612
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
我还要为你撒多少谎？
How much should I lie for you ?

613
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
在你结婚前..
Before marriage...

614
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,280
结婚前，我不得不对帕瑞玛撒谎说你不喝酒也不抽烟
Before marriage I had to lie to Parimal that you dont drink or smoke..

615
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,920
他们把女儿嫁到我们家是因为他们信任我们
They married their daughter into our family because they had trust in us.

616
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,880
你也答应过你妈妈
And you had promised your mom

617
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,760
你会戒烟
That you would quit smoking!

618
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,200
你戒了吗？
Did you quit?

619
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
好吧，对不起，爸爸
Okay, Sorry papa.

620
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,200
如果你真的想抽烟，那就嚼口香糖吧
If you get desperate to smoke than have a chewing gum .

621
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,950
哈迪亚尔就是这样戒烟的
Hardiyal quit it the same way.

622
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,400
好吧，爸爸，那我去楼下买点薄荷糖来
Okay Papa then I will go, get some mint from downstairs!

623
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
给你
Here.

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
拿去吧
Have it.

625
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,840
如果你再发出一点声音
If you make one more sound

626
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,280
我会把机油倒你嘴里让你漱口
I will put castrol in your mouth and make you gargle it.

627
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,950
我们还在等什么？
What are we waiting for ?

628
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,560
我们已经赚翻了
We are getting soo much money now!

629
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,880
如果我们继续拖时间，那这些钱就没了
If we take more time then even this plan will get ruined.

630
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,600
纳文有做决定的权利
Naveen has the first right to take a decision.

631
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,800
等他从陪审室出来
Let him come out of the jury room.

632
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
然后我们再做决定
Then we will decide.

633
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,280
这个陪审室是干什么的？
What is this jury room ?

634
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,200
我从大学时就看他这样做过
I've been sseing it since our college time.

635
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,400
每当纳文面对困境时
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

636
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,960
每当纳文面对困境时
Whenever Naveen faces a dilema

637
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,120
他会把自己锁在房间里15分钟
He locks himself in a room for 15 minutes.

638
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,960
然后做出正确的决定
And he comes out with the right decision.

639
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,560
这就是为什么我们称之为陪审室
And thats why we call it a jury room.

640
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,960
但是在这种场合，他是怎么找到空房间的呢？
But in such a busy event, how did he find a empty room ?

641
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,520
这是典型的性别歧视
This is the height of sexism.

642
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,120
难道他们根本就不想让女性企业家来吗？
What, were they not expecting female entreprenuers at all ?

643
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,360
男厕所开着，但女厕所却锁着
Gents washroom is open but the female washroom is locked!

644
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,120
在这样的比赛中你碰到很多这样的事情
You will get a lot of mcps in such events.

645
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,920
你知道吗
You know what..

646
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,360
甚至在我的名片上印的都是我兄弟的电话号码
Even in my visiting card I have given my brothers number.

647
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
你是怎么做到的？
And how did you ?

648
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,760
如果一百块能够说服英国人... ..
If one Gandhiji can convice lacks of britishers ...

649
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,920
为什么二百块不能说服保洁员
Why wouldn't a housekeeper get convinced with two!

650
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,760
你们还在这儿？
You guys are still here ?

651
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,200
是啊
Ya.

652
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,400
没回家？
Didn't go home?

653
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,200
没回家？
Didn't go home?

654
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,670
你们公司的 CEO 在哪里？
Where is that CEO of your's ?

655
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,800
我们正在等他
Actually that's who we are waiting for!

656
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,280
如果你有时间的话
If you're wasting time...

657
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
那就在推特上关注我吧
Then follow me on twitter!

658
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,840
好啊
Ya ya..

659
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
我有198个粉丝
I have 198 followers.

660
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
如果你们两个都关注我，那么那就破二百了
If you both follow me, then it'll become a double century.

661
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,440
妈的
Shit !

662
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,910
我只有116个粉..
I have only 116...

663
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,960
但是我在领英上有312个粉丝
But I have 312 followers on linkedIn.

664
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,880
312？
312 ?

665
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
妈的
Shit !

666
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,280
等我的应用程序发布
Just wait for my app to get launched..

667
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,280
看我怎么追上你
Then watch how I overtake you.

668
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,520
你为什么不去那边交朋友呢？
Why can't you go there and do your networking ?

669
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,270
其实我在等我的室友
Actually I am waiting for my roommate..

670
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,280
其实我在等我的室友

671
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,400
我忘带钥匙了

672
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,230
我忘带钥匙了
I forgot my keys.

673
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
我忘带钥匙了

674
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
其他七个人都被淘汰了
Even the other 7 are out.

675
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,440
他是来给我送钥匙的
So he is coming to give me the keys.

676
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
你们是9个人住在一起吗？
You'll are 9 people staying together?

677
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,400
四居室？
4 BHK ?

678
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,390
不不
No No..

679
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,480
两居室
It's a 2 BHK

680
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
但空间足够大
But spacious enough.

681
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,280
74平
800 sqft.

682
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,720
其实
Actually

683
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,240
自从我2008年离婚后..
Since I got a divorced in 2008...

684
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,800
我就不得不住在合租房里
I've to live in a shared apartment!

685
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,520
这样可以建立
It helps you build..

686
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
团队精神
Teamspirit.

687
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,840
你离婚了？
You had a divorce ?

688
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
是的
Yes.

689
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
对不起
Sorry.

690
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,520
你为什么说对不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

691
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,120
你为什么说对不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

692
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,840
当她不说对不起的时候
When she is not saying sorry..

693
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,200
你为什么说对不起？
Why you're saying sorry ?

694
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,050
没关系
It's okay.

695
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,680
并不是每个人的婚姻都那么完美
Everyone is not that lucky to have a Sudhamurthi in their life.

696
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,920
等我的公司拿到融资
Once my company gets funded...

697
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,920
老子一天换一个女朋友
Just wait and watch how 'Manglik' girls line up for me!

698
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,830
但是这么多年来，你一次融资也没拿到？
But in so many years you didn't get funded even once ?

699
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
也不是……
I did..

700
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,160
2003年的时候
In 2003 I did..

701
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,600
有一个投资者准备投我
There was an investor who was ready to invest..

702
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,360
但是要求50% 的股权
But was asking for 50% equity.

703
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,310
但是我们的创始人兼首席执行官
And our founder and CEO

704
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,240
有点像佛祖
Was sort of a buddha type..

705
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
他拒绝了
Said no to it .

706
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,720
从那以后直到今天... 我向上帝发誓
Since then till today... I swear to god

707
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,600
我唯一一次睡安稳觉的时候是在火车的卧铺车厢里
The only time I have slept peacefully is while travelling in a train's sleeper class.

708
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,150
喂
Ya karunesh..

709
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
喂
Yes.

710
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,910
是的
Yes.

711
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:14,920
是的

712
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,520
进来吧
Come inside.

713
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,440
什么
What !

714
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
他们不让你进？
They aren't letting you?

715
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,840
你为什么总是穿短裤出门？
Why do you always come in boxers???

716
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,120
笨蛋
Dumbfuck!

717
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,960
怎么了？
What happened ?

718
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,320
说话啊？
Tell me what happened ?

719
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,000
尤吉？
Yogi ?

720
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,480
我已经决定了
Okay, I have decided.

721
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,360
什么？
What ?

722
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,400
我想等人齐了再说，我们一起去杰图家吧
I want to tell you'll with Jeetu. Let's go to his place .

723
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,910
你在干什么？
What are you doing ?

724
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,360
尤吉给我发短信了，我得下去一趟
Yogi'd texted me. I am going down.

725
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
他们在停车场等我
They are waiting for me in the parking lot.

726
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,720
如果爸爸醒了，我该怎么办？
What will I answer dad if he gets up ?

727
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,240
拖2分钟就好
Please handle it for 2mins..

728
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,960
求你了
Please..

729
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,830
求你了
Please.

730
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,960
好吧，你去吧
Okay, you go...

731
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,640
我拖住他
I will handle it.

732
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,440
他家三楼还是四楼？
Third floor or fourth floor ?

733
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,960
来了
Terrace !

734
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,120
别在这站着...-嘿，杰图
Don't stand... -Hey jitu, hie..

735
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,560
不要站在这里，这里的保安是我爸爸的间谍
Don't stand over here, the watchman out here is my dad's spy.

736
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,250
- 你怎么决定的?-曼达尔，把声音调小点
Hmm, so what did you decide? Mandal, lower the volume.

737
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,770
你怎么决定的，我们拿加里的钱，对吧？
So what did you decide, we are taking money from Gary, right ?

738
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,870
这家伙什么都没告诉我们
This one's not telling us anything at all!

739
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,160
不，我们不拿他的钱
No, we aren't taking money from Gary.

740
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,200
事实上我已经给他发短信说”不”了
Infact I already texted him saying "No".

741
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
纳文，这个决定背后的逻辑是什么？
Naveen, what is the logic behind this ?

742
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,440
什么逻辑，这是我们的想法，我们的努力
What logic, It's our idea our hardwork

743
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,360
我们花了这么长的时间来研究它
We are working on it from such a long time

744
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,600
现在怎么可以随意的把一半股权给别人？
Now randomly we would give away half the stakes to somebody, why ?

745
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,870
他给我们钱啊，这就是为什么，你还不明白吗
He is giving us money, that's why, don't you get it..

746
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,680
这对我们公司的估值有很大帮助啊
How it helps our compnay's valuation!

747
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,840
我向你保证，在一年内我们能创造更多的价值
I guarantee you, in one year we will create more value than this .

748
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
纳文
Naveen..

749
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,120
你是认真的吗
Are you serious !

750
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
我们甚至都不能参加今天的活动了
We couldn't even go for today's event

751
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,380
别想募集资金了
Forget about raising funds...

752
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:29,400
投资者绝不会打电话给我们第二次机会
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

753
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,640
投资者绝不会打电话给我们第二次机会
Investors aren't calling us for even a second meeting.

754
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,840
你认为金主爸爸们会来……
You think Sikoya and Nexus will join hands...

755
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,470
求你接受他们的投资吗
and beg you to take their investments ? !

756
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
求你接受他们的投资吗
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

757
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,310
我们得妥协一下，纳文
We'lll have to compromise a little, Naveen .

758
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
我们得妥协一下，纳文

759
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,160
你们难道没有意识到这个家伙是一个卑鄙的商人
Aren't you all realising that thios guy is a 'Bhujiyawaala'.

760
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
他甚至没有技术背景
He doesn't even have a technical background..

761
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
他将会如何理解我们的产品？
How will he understand our product ?

762
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,600
这是优势啊
That's the advantage.

763
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,520
如果他没有任何技术背景
If he doesn't have any technical knowledge

764
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,360
他就不会干涉的-如果他干涉呢？
he won't interfere . -what if he interferes ?

765
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,960
那我们就完了
Then we're fucked.

766
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
我们以后再考虑这个问题
We'll think about it later..

767
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,600
你怎么能独自做出如此重要的决定呢？
And how can you take such an important decision by yourself?

768
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,200
就因为你的名片上写着总裁
Just because you've C.E.O. on your visiting card...

769
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,720
并不意味着你就是老板
... doesn't mean you are the boss.

770
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,360
纳文
Naveen

771
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,790
我们是一个团队
We are a team..

772
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,960
但是团队里没有我
And there is no I in team.

773
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,830
兄弟们，不是这样的
Guys it isn't that..

774
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,400
每次我在陪审室里做出决定都是正确的
You know, whenever I've taken a decision in the jury room, it's always been right

775
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
是吗？
yes？

776
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,720
你在陪审室里到底是怎么做的？
And what exactly do you do in the jury room ?

777
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,670
什么？
What ?

778
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
我在问你
I am asking you!

779
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,000
你在陪审室里是怎么做决定的？
How do you take your decision in the jury room?

780
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
这很简单
It's simple..

781
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:22,680
He must be listing down the pros and cons..

782
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,240
他一定是在列举利弊
He must be listing down the pros and cons..

783
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,250
他一定是在列举利弊

784
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,400
对其进行 SWAT 分析并确定可行性
Does a SWAT analysis of it and determines the probablity.

785
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,440
我在高中的时候也这样做过
Even I have done that in the third semester of my high school

786
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
SWAT分析？
SWAT analysis ?..

787
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
可行性？
Probablity ?..

788
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,520
他他妈的扔了一枚硬币然后就定了
He fucking tosses a coin and decides.

789
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,400
什么
What !

790
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,840
就这样？
Tosses and decides ?

791
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,200
纳文，看着我
Naveen look here..

792
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,600
当年我娶桑亚的时候就是让你做的决定啊！！
I had decided to marry saumya after asking you!

793
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,270
我不需要掷硬币来决定
I didn't need to toss a coin for that.

794
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,360
但是你今天就需要？
But you needed it today?

795
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,480
你他妈的用硬币决定了
You fucking decided four peoples carrer,ambition

796
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,280
四个人的事业，野心和未来！
and their future on the basis of tossing a coin !

797
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,000
如果是硬币的另一面呢？
And what if it was the other side of the coin ?

798
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,170
那么我们现在是不是应该在加里的农舍拍他马屁?
Then right now we would have been in Gary's farmhouse licking his ass ? !

799
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,440
纳文，你要下地狱我都跟你，但我不能跟随1卢比的硬币
Naveen I can follow you till hell but I can't follow a 1 Rupee coin.

800
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,200
纳文我们都辞职了
Naveen, everyone has left their job...

801
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
这家创业公司是你的主意，对吧？
This startup was your idea, right ?

802
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,440
我们在你家每天连续工作16个小时
We are working 16 hrs continously at your home.

803
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,200
然而这位首席执行官掷硬币做决定
And this CEO tosses a coin and decides.

804
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,440
至少你可以问我们一次？
Atleast you could have asked us once ?

805
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,770
这对你来说很难吗
Was that asking for too much from you?

806
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,260
你投出来的是什么? 正面还是反面?-我不知道
What was it Naveen? Head or tail ? - Guys I don't know what it was!

807
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,720
作出决定依据是抛硬币的过程，而不是抛硬币的结果
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing the coin, not on the result of it.

808
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,750
什么意思？
What do you mean ?

809
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,750
就像这枚硬币，生活给了我们两个选择..
Like this coin even life gives us 2 choices...

810
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,840
不管你列出多少赞成和反对的理由，双方的几率一定是平等的
No matter how many lists of pros and cons you make both sides would always be equal

811
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,230
而且你无法做出选择
And you won't be able to pick any side.

812
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,200
这时你能做的就是倾听你的心声
That time all you can do is listen to your heart.

813
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,830
这就是为什么如果你只抛一次硬币，你就会知道哪一面朝上
That's why if you toss the coin once, you will come to know which side won.

814
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,960
但是你还没看到它是正还是反？
But you didn't even see if it was a head or a tail ?

815
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,640
我不用看，已经听到了
I didnt see it but I heard it.

816
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,470
当硬币在空中的时候
When the coin stays in the air for half a second..

817
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,190
一个声音从你的心底传来……
A voice answers from the bottom of your heart...

818
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,320
说道：
Which says..

819
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,320
是正面，是正面
Please let it be heads, please heads!

820
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,830
这时你就会意识到不管硬币是正面还是反面
That's when you realize no matter what the result is...

821
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,200
你的内心希望它是正面的
Your heart wants it to be heads.

822
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,250
我意识到我们的第一笔投资不能建立在贪婪的基础上
And I have realised that our first investment can't be set on the basis of greed.

823
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,620
加里贪图公平，而我们贪图钱财
Where gary is in greed of equity and we of money

824
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,520
我们的第一笔投资应该是基于我们的..
Our first investment should be only on the basis of our...

825
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,600
创意与技术
Idea and skill.

826
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,680
如果只是因为钱，那我不能让任何人控制我的野心
Just for more funding I can't let anyone control my ambitions.

827
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,970
我真的很抱歉我不能这么做
I am really sorry I could'nt do it.

828
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,760
现在你们想怎么办
Now you guys decide what to do.

829
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,800
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going ?

830
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,000
回去继续参加活动
