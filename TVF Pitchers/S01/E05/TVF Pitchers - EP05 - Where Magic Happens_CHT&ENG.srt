1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,670
好啊，那你以什麼身份去？
Ok. What defines you better?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:03,770
麥肯錫的商業顧問還是納文·班薩爾的女朋友？
Ok. What defines you better?

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,770
麥肯錫的商業顧問還是納文·班薩爾的女朋友？
Business Consultant at Mckenzie or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,270
拉維 · 拉斯托吉
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,270
首席執行官、首席技術官、首席營銷官
CEO, CTO, CMO

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Superentreprenuer.com 創始人
Founder, Superentreprenuer.com

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,970
這是我的第八家公司
This is my 8th company

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,120
在這之前的那七家呢？
and about those seven before this?

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,020
都倒閉了
They were shut down.

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,150
我們現在得和評委談談
We have to talk to the judges now

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,220
納拉揚·穆西來了嗎？
Is Narayan Murthy here yet?

12
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,670
活動工作人員現在已經找到了一個新的替代者
So the event staff has seeked a new replacement now

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,850
你怎麼能阻止別人參加比賽？
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:23,920
你們能不能讓其他團隊簽一份說明讓他們同意你參賽
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,900
你們能不能讓其他團隊簽一份說明讓他們同意你參賽
Can you just get the other teams to sign on a paper That they're okay with you participating

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
不能去創業公司工作，明白嗎？
Don't even think about working in a startup, okay?

17
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,670
你聽到了嗎？
Do you hear me?

18
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,670
事實上，他冇有跟你說實情
Actually, he didn't tell you the whole thing

19
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,950
他想繼續創業
He wants to carry on with the startup

20
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,780
好吧，看來我的話在這裏冇有任何意義
Alright then, it seems like my words have no meaning here

21
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
爸爸，給他個機會

22
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,780
爸爸，別走

23
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
你已經盡力了，親愛的
You tried your best dear

24
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,220
我冇有放棄
i didn't give up and run back

25
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
而是選擇站在這裏
but i choose to stand here to face you guys

26
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,620
拉傑，你告訴我，我不能在臺上賣我的産品
Rajat you told me that I cannot sell my product here on stage

27
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,620
所以我賣自己
Therefore I sold myself

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,450
順便說一嘴，我是普尼特，這是我的名片
by the way i'm Puneet i work for a vc firm, and this is my card

29
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,650
我星期四下午有空，你們星期四有時間嗎？
I'm free on thursday afternoon, what are you guys doing on thursday?

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,550
相遇隻是開始，共處才有進展，能持續通力合作則是成功

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,800
所以卡魯內什邀請他的女朋友過來
So, Karunesh invited his girlfriend over

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,400
我跟他說你們睡下層，我睡上層
I told him to use the lower bed frame of the bunk bed and I'll use the upper one

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
你倆好好玩
You enjoy your privacy

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,300
他同意了
He agreed

35
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,800
但是莫漢蒂晚上錄了他們的小視頻
But Mohanti made an MMS clip of them in the night

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
然後把視頻轉發給了我
And forwarded the clip to me

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
他在早上起來非常生氣，開始對我大喊大叫
He became upset in the morning and started yelling at me

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,700
這甚至都不是我的錯
It wasn't even my fault

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
聽著，拉斯托吉！
Listen Rastogi!

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
你聽說過羅納德 · 韋恩嗎？
Have you heard of Ronald Wayne?

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
誰？
Who?

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
羅納德 · 韋恩，聽說過他嗎？
Ronald Wayne, ever heard of him?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
他是蝙蝠俠的父親嗎？
Was he Batman's father?

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
他是一個企業家
He was an entrepreneur

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,900
40年前，他和他的兩個朋友開了一家公司
40 years ago he started a company with his 2 friends

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
今天，這家公司價值數十億美元
Today that company is worth billions of dollars

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
但是冇有人認識他
But Nobody knows him

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
你知道那家公司的名字嗎？
Do you know what is the name of that company?

49
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
什麼名字？
What?

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
蘋果
Apple

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,900
每個人都知道史蒂夫 · 喬佈斯是誰
Everyone knows who Steve Jobs was

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
很多人可能也知道史蒂夫 · 沃茲尼亞克
Many people might know about Steve Wozniak too

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
但是冇有人記得第三個人的名字
But no one ever remembers the name of the 3rd guy

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
而我是第四個人
And look I'm the 4th guy

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
尤吉說了什麼嗎？
Yogi said something?

56
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,800
不要因為尤吉說的話而不高興，他可能是因為脫發而生氣
Don't be antsy about what Yogi said, He is probably annoyed with his hairfall

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
他還能說什麼呢？
What could he even say?

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,300
總有一天我會痛扁他一頓，他還冇看到我粗暴的一麵
I'll whoop his sorry ass someday, He hasn't seen my livid side yet

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
但是傑圖呢？
But Jeetu?

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,400
我上周在電話裏告訴他，下個月一號是銀行休假日
I told him on the phone last week that its a bank holiday on the 1st of next month

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
接著就是是一個周末
Following with a weekend

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
所以他的薪水可能會晚三四天
So his salary would be 3,4 days overdue

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
他直接就掛電話了
He disconnected the phone halfway

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,600
真冇禮貌！
How rude!

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,900
你知道我告訴納文這件事時他說了什麼嗎？
Do you know what Naveen said when I told him about this?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
我很忙，曼達爾，我晚點再和你談
I'm busy Mandal I'll talk to you later

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,300
去給我泡杯茶
Go make some tea for me

68
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
這是和首席營銷官講話的方式嗎？
Is this a way to talk to a CMO?

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
根本不是
Not at all

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,000
有時候我覺得自己什麼都不是，拉斯托吉
Sometimes it feels like that I'm nothing, Rastogi

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
我是說
I mean

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
納文做了産品展示
Naveen gives presentations

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,900
傑圖負責編碼
Jeetu does coding

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
尤吉去拉供應商
Yogi gets to meet with vendors

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
冇人給我安排正經的事情做
No one gives me any work to do

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
我覺得我就和空氣一樣
I think I'm a zero

77
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
不要為這些愚蠢的小事煩惱
Don't fret over these stupid little things

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
看看我，我已經奮鬥了14年
Look at me, I've been fighting for 14 years

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,800
而你6個月後就能拿到種子資金了
Look at you, who is gonna bag seed funding in just 6 months

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,700
而且是來自大西洋資本
From none other than Plutus atlantic

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,300
現在隻剩下合夥人會議了
You're only left with the partner meeting now

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,000
到時候每個人都會承認你在市場上的聲譽
Then everyone will acknowledge your reputation in the market

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
我不需要市場的任何尊重，拉斯托吉
I don't need any respect from the market, Rastogi

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
我隻是想讓我的三個朋友尊重我
I just want my 3 friends to respect me

85
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
那你就要嚮他們展示你的奉獻精神
Then show them your dedication

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
為你們的事業奉獻你的血汗和淚水
Give your blood, sweat and tears to this startup

87
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,800
多做一些事情，他們就會開始尊重你
Go the extra mile and they'll start respecting you

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,900
我還要怎麼嚮他們展示我的奉獻精神呢？
How else am I going to show them dedication?

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
我一周五天為傑圖鞍前馬後
I am the one who works his ass off for Jeetu 5 days a week

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,500
到了晚上我已經筋疲力盡了，但我還是會為尤吉和納文做晚飯
I get exhausted by the evening but I still cook dinner for Yogi and Naveen

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,000
我整天帶著這個U盤走來走去
I go around all day with this pen drive clinging to me

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,000
如果這樣奉獻的還不夠，那我真不知道該怎麼做了
If this isn't enough dedication then I don't know what is

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
這個U盤是怎麼回事？
What's with this pen drive?

94
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,670
公司所有的秘密
All the company's secrets

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
所有重要的文件
Everything important to the company...

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,900
都在這個U盤裏麵
...is in this pen drive

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
這個U盤能使我們的公司成為大公司
This is what will make our company big

98
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,300
每次會議後我都會更新
I update it after every meeting

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
我去年在紐約，花了5美元買來的
I was in New York last year, got it from there for $5

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
但我確信這個5塊錢的U盤有一天會給我們帶來50億美元的收入
But I'm sure that this same device will get us 5 Billion dollars one day

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,900
你怎麼不喝這個？
Why don't you drink this? huh?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,100
放輕鬆
Yeah Chill out!

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
不不不不
No no no no

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,000
我隻喝啤酒.
I will drink only beer...

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,300
我喝這種劣質飲料會不舒服
I have a digestion problem with these inferior quality drinks

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
喝吧，這冇什麼不好的
Drink up, there's nothing wrong with it

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
特別推薦
This is Rastogi's special

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
這是我們第六次創業時賣的東西
This is what we were selling in our 6th startup venture

109
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
科倫坡海嘯
Colombo Tsunami

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
這個名字起得不好
The title is a little insensitive

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
否則老虎環球公司絕對會給我們投錢
Otherwise Tiger Global would've been onboard just like that

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,300
就沖你這句話，我就喝一小口
Just for you, I'll have one sip

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,000
好吧，兩口
Okay, two

114
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
傑圖老婆超性感
Jeetu's wife is so hot man

115
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,500
真的嗎？
Really?

116
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
而且很有教養
And so cultured

117
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,900
我不知道我媽在哪裏找到這些蠢女人，還堅持要我去見她們
I don't know where my mom finds these dumb bimbos and insists me to meet them

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
我曾經問過一個女孩，“你喜歡《阿凡達》的什麼? ”
I once asked a girl, "What do you like about Avatar?"

119
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,000
她說: “拉傑什·坎納(Avtaar 演員)太可愛了.”
She said, "Rajesh Khanna(*Actor in Avtaar) is so cute"

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
這都什麼鬼啊？
I mean what the fuck girls?

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
抱歉，我兩分鍾後回來，憋不住了
Sorry, I'll be back in 2 minutes, Nature's call

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
快點回來
Come back in a jiffy

123
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
你得付賬
You have to pay the bill

124
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
當然，我玩得很開心
Of course, I had a good time

125
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
謝謝你！
Thank you!

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
不，不，謝謝你才對
No no, thank you

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
如果他們問你期望薪資多少，告訴他們給你點時間考慮一下
If they ask you about the salary, tell them to give you a minute to think

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
告訴hr你自己開車上下班
Tell the HR that you'll manage your own transportation

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,600
他們會非常高興的
They'll be as pleased as punch

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
夥計們，優步已經接單了，五分鍾後到
Guys, Uber is booked Cab will be here in Five

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,600
快點，納文! 我們要再確認一下
Hurry-up Naveen! We have to double check

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
如果不是因為要升副總，我才不會來
If it weren't for my VP promotion, I wouldn't be fighting for you

133
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
我這麼做是因為你們的産品很有前途
I'm doing this because your product is promising

134
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
別抱怨了，我從昨晚就準備好了
Stop yammering, I've been ready since last night

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
我係著領帶睡覺
I even slept wearing the tie

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
傑圖，過來
Jeetu, come along now

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
等一下
Hold on a minute

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,500
檢查衣櫃的抽屜，裏麵一定有一個白色的手提包
Check in the closet drawer, there must be a white carry bag

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,500
是的，有卡利亞尼紗麗的那個
Yes the one with Kalyani sari

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
你能找到你的證件、護照、支票簿和其他文件.
You'll find your certificate, passport, checkbook and every document in it.

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
他在幹什麼？
What is he up to?

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
她老婆今天要麵試一份工作
Soumya is interviewing for a job today

143
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,200
他已經絮叨兩個小時了
He's been blabbering about his postmodern post-marriage love story for 2 hours

144
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,600
嘿，尤吉
Hey Yogi!

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
你看見我的U盤了嗎？
Have you seen my pen drive?

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
哪一個？
Which one?

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
跟那個一樣的
The same with...

148
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
尤吉已經做了兩三個備份了
Yogi has already taken 2 or 3 backups of the presentation

149
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
餵，聽著
Oh hello!

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
六個備份
Six backups

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
不，不在這裏
No its not here

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
曼達爾你給我坐下
Mandal, sit your ass down

153
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
曼達爾，坐下
Mandal, sit down there

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,900
納文你怎麼回事？
Naveen, what the hell is going on?

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
納文，過來！你在這裏幹什麼？
Naveen, come along What are you even doing here?

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,000
我隻能睡4個小時，至少讓我洗洗臉
I could only sleep for 4 hours, At least let me wash my face

158
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
我們今天終於要拿到資金了
We're finally getting the funding today

159
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,500
我的運氣在閃耀，我的臉也應該閃耀，不是嗎？
My luck is shining and so should my face, No?

160
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,500
你們這些家夥太小看這次會議了
You guys are taking this meeting very lightly

161
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
這麼跟你說吧
I'm telling you since day 1...

162
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,500
就算公司裏的每個人都喜歡你的主意，那也跟你能不能拿到錢冇關係
...everyone in the firm is liking your idea but this has nothing to do with seed funding

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
重要的是巴德瓦伊喜不喜歡
All that matters is whether Bhardwaj likes it or not

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,900
我們隻剩下30分鍾了，來吧，快過來
We've just 30 minutes left, Come along now come on come on

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
你們就快遲到了
You guys are so tardy...

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,300
把它關掉
...Turn it off

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
好了，我坐下了
Alright I'm sitting down

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
不，不，起來
No no get up

169
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
一定要準時，寺廟可以晚點去
Just be punctual, Temples can wait

170
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
傑圖！
Jeetu!

171
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
好吧，我掛了
Alright I'm hanging up

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
聽著，早餐在冰箱裏，記得吃，好嗎？
Hey listen, breakfast is in the fridge Eat properly, Okay?

173
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
哦，還有甜酸奶，它會給你帶來好運
Oh and have some sweet yoghurt, it'll bring you good luck

174
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
一切順利
All the best

175
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
替我祝她好運
Wish her good luck for me

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
納文祝你一切順利
Naveen wishes you all the best

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,000
也替我祝福她
Wish her for me too

178
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,000
行了，別bb了
Just say it simultaneously and be done with it guys

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,500
不，冇什麼，普尼特祝你一切順利.我晚點再打給你
No its nothing, Puneet wishes you all the best. I'll talk to you later

180
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
對不起
Sorry

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
你們知道嗎? 理想情況下我根本不該來這裏
Do you guys know that Ideally I shouldn't even be here

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
我為什麼來這裏？
Why did I come here?

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
最重要的是...
The most important...

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,900
你們要和誰見麵？
With whom are you guys meeting?

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,500
太平洋資本的資深合夥人安吉·巴特瓦吉
Ankit Bhardwaj, senior partner Plutus Atlantic

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
你們知道他是誰嗎？
Do you guys have any idea who is he?

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
在風投圈子裏，他被稱為邁達斯·巴德瓦吉
He's known as Midas Bhardwaj in the VC circles

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
是邁迪斯還是邁達斯？
Is it Midas or Midaas?

189
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,000
你閉嘴
Shut up you benighted fool

190
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,000
他的投資組合中有市值1700多萬美元的公司，而他的反投資組合中卻冇有一家
He has 17 multi million dollar companies in his portfolio and zero in his anti portfolio

191
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,000
什麼是反投資組合？
What's anti portfolio?

192
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,000
什麼是投資者的投資組合？
What is investor's portfolio?

193
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,100
他選擇投資的公司都很成功
The companies he chose to fund and they became successful

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
那麼它的反義詞是什麼？
Then what is its ANTI?

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,500
那些他選擇不投資的公司，卻取得了成功
The companies he chose not to fund and yet they became successful

196
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
冇錯
Exactly

197
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,000
巴德瓦伊在他的個人資料中冇有任何反投資組合的標題
Bhardwaj doesn't have any header of anti-portfolio in his profile

198
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
如果他今天拒絕你的提議...
Now if he rejects your idea today...

199
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,000
記住我的話，在孟買或班加羅爾，就不會有人看好你們了
...then mark my words no one will give a flying fuck to your idea in Bombay or Bangalore

200
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,500
那麼既然你們不想去德裏，我也不想永遠做一個分析師
Now you don't want to go to Delhi and I don't want to remain as an analyst forever

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
所以讓我們一起專註這件事，好嗎？
So let's focus on it together, Okay?

202
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
在那個房間裏的30分鍾...
Those 30 minutes inside that room...

203
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,000
決定你們上天堂還是下地獄
...can take your lives in two completely opposite direction

204
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
你有一個令人印象深刻的産品，你做了很多辛苦的工作
You have an impressive product and you did a lot of elbow grease on it

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
就是這樣
This is what it boils down to

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
還有進去的時候別忘了先好好舔他
And don't forget to lick his balls the minute you enter there

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
好了，出租車來了我們走吧
Alright guys, cab is here Let's leave

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
納文，把你的襯衫扣子係好
Naveen, button your shirt to the neck

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
曼達爾，我找不到
Mandal- I couldn't find it

210
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
小朋友們，快點！
Puneet- Guys hurry up!

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
傑圖-讓我穿上鞋子
Jeetu- Let me put on my shoes

212
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,000
傑圖 -曼達爾 你又穿我的襪子了？
Jeetu- Mandal did you wear my socks again?

213
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,000
- 曼達爾 - 不，我穿的是自己的
Mandal- No, I'm wearing my own

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
傑圖，你的演示版準備好了嗎？
Jeetu, your demo is ready?

215
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
那麼Facebook登錄呢？
What about FB login?

216
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,500
哦，還冇有
Oh, not yet

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
我在出租車上做
I'll do it in the cab

218
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,000
好吧
Yeah okay

219
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
我應該打領帶嗎？
Should I wear a tie?

220
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
你穿內褲去都行
You can wear boxers in their let alone tie

221
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,970
安基特，納文和他的團隊
Ankit, Naveen and team

222
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,370
你好，我是安基特
hi, i'm Ankit. -Naveen

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,770
你們要喝點什麼嗎？-不用了
you guys want anything？tea？coffee？

224
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
我看了你的演講，非常發人深省
Sir, I saw your TED Talk it was very thought provoking

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
哪個演講? 加利福尼亞還是溫哥華？
Which one? California or Vancouver?

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
兩個都看了
Both of them

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
真的嗎? 下個月才去溫哥華
Really? Vancouver is next month

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
普尼特，你要點什麼嗎？
Puneet, you want anything?

229
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
很抱歉，但是...
I'm sorry guys but...

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
不，不，冇關係，你吃你的
No no its okay feel free

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,000
早餐冇吃，現在我妻子要我吃燕麥作為懲罰
Missed the breakfast, now my wife is making me eat oats as a punishment

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
你們結婚了嗎？
You guys are married?

233
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,200
隻有我結婚了，先生
Only me sir

234
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
那你們有女朋友了嗎
Oh, so girlfriends?

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
先生，納文有女朋友
Sir, Naveen has one

236
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
那麼安基特，我們要現在開始演示嗎？
So Ankit, should we start the presentation?

237
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
納文
Naveen

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
不，等一下
Uh no wait a second

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
等一下
Hold on for a minute

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
夥計們...
Guys...

241
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
今天我從班加羅爾回來的路上……
...on my way back from bangalore today

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
我必須說這個想法有很大的潛力
And I must say the idea has lot of potential

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
你們提到的目標是相當現實並且是實現的
The targets that you guys have mentioned are quite realistic and achievable

244
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
而且收入模式也令人印象深刻
And the revenue model is also very impressive

245
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,500
謝謝，先生
Thank you sir

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
但是...
BUT...

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
我要強調但是
And I say the BUT in capital letters

248
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
就在幾天前，有幾個人給我介紹了...
Couple of days back, few guys presented me...

249
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
想法和目標與你們完全一緻
...the exact same idea with the exact same targets

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
並且收入模式也完全一緻
and the exact same revenue models

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
我不知道這是怎麼回事
Now I'm not sure how this has happened

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,900
等一下，安吉特
Hold on a minute, Ankit

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
我和這些人在一起已經三四個星期了，我非常確信這個想法是他們原創的
I've been with these guys for last 3,4 weeks now I'm pretty convinced that its their original idea...

254
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
我不認為他們會剽竊或者...
I don't think they have stolen it or..

255
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
不，不，我冇有指責任何人
No no I'm not accusing anybody

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,900
即使對我來說，這也是一個特殊的情況
Even for me this is a unique situation

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
但是兩個團隊有著完全相同的想法.
But two teams with exactly the same idea..

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,100
不可能隻是巧合
can't just be a coincidence

259
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
但是我們從大學起就有這個想法...
But we have this idea since college...

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
抱歉
sorry,sorry

261
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,000
但是安吉特，我們從大學就開始研究這個了
But Ankit we've been on this since college

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
如果你想看的話，我也可以把我們內部的溝通郵件給你看
If you want I can also show you our chat and conversation over mail

263
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
我們已經計畫了3年
We've been planning this for 3 years

264
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,900
老弟，我不是偵探
Guys guys I'm not a detective

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
我是一個投資者
I'm an investor

266
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
同樣的産品被兩個不同的團隊兩次推薦給我
And the same product has been pitched to me twice by 2 different teams

267
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,070
先生，你能透露他們的名字嗎？
Sir, I mean can you disclose their names?

268
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
好吧.
Well...

269
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,500
現在我不能透露他們的名字
I can't reveal their names at this point of time

270
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
還有...
And...

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
這對你們來說就有了一些改變
This changes few things for you guys

272
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,500
讓我來解釋一下投資到底是如何運作的
Let me explain you how the investment process really works

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
在這片未知的海洋裏
So, in this sea of unknown

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,000
你們在這個島上
You guys are sitting here on this island

275
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,800
帶著你們滿意的創業想法
Comfortably with your idea

276
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,800
我們把這個島叫做.
Let's call this island..

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
舒適區
Comfort zone

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
我在這個島上
And I'm here on this island

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200
神奇的事情發生了
Where magic happens

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
這就是大公司形成的地方
This is where big companies are formed

281
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
現在你們必須到這裏來
Now you guys have to reach here

282
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
有兩種選擇
There are 2 options

283
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,900
一.
One..

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
你走出你的舒適區，開始遊泳
You step out of your comfort zone and start swimming

285
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,400
你將不得不麵對不確定的浪潮
You'll have to face the waves of uncertainty, the tides of sacrifice

286
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
命運無法預測的氣候變化
The unpredictable climate change of destiny

287
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,000
還有... 我不確定你能不能撐到那兒
And... I'm not sure if you're gonna make it to there

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
但幸運的是，你們還有另一個選擇
But luckily for you guys, there's another option

289
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,500
我有一條船，就叫它小金船吧
I have a boat named as $$ money

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
我可以把這艘船送給你們
I can send this boat to you guys

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
你可以上我的船，很容易就能到達這個島
You can hop into that boat and can easily make it to this island

292
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
但這就是問題所在
But herein lies the problem

293
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
你們島嶼的複製品就在海的這一端
A replica of your island is at this end of the sea

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
而我隻能把我的船隻送往一個方嚮
And I can send my boat in only one direction

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,500
但是，先生，既然這是我們最初的想法，我們不應該得到投資嗎？
But sir shouldn't we get the investment since its our original idea?

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
但是……
But guys..

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
因為這船是我的
Because I own the boat

298
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
隻有我能做出這樣的選擇
Only I can make that choice

299
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,300
雖然聽起來很不幸
And as unfortunate as it may sound

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,870
但是現在決定權
The ball right now is..

301
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,700
完全在我的手上
..completely in my court

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
我知道這是機密，所以我才打電話給你
I know its confidential, that's why I called you

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
你的晉升要出問題? 那我晚點給你打電話.好的，再見
Your promotion's on stake? I'll call you later then. Okay bye

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
夥計們，巴德瓦伊不會透露對方的名字
Guys, thing is that Bhardwaj is not gonna disclose the names

305
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
班加羅爾的團隊也不開口
And Bangalore team is also uncommunicative

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
實際上很難知道他們是誰
Realistically its tough to get the names

307
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
普尼特，你能想出辦法來嗎？
Puneet, can you work something out?

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
我正在努力，但還有一個問題
I'm trying but there's another problem

309
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
巴德瓦伊後天就要去迪拜了
Bhardwaj is leaving for Dubai day after tomorrow

310
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,100
然後呢？
What then?

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
我會在明天的第二次會議上解決這個問題，別擔心，我有一些關係
I'll sort it out in a 2nd meeting tomorrow, Don't worry I have some contacts

312
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
我會打電話給他們，然後再打給你
I'll call them and get back to you

313
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
該死！
Shit man

314
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
你確定普尼特冇有泄露我們的想法？
Are you sure that Puneet didn't leak our idea?

315
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,300
不，不，他自己的晉升危在旦夕，不是他幹的
No no his own promotion is on stake, he didn't do it

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
史瑞雅怎麼了? 你知道我今天要開會
What's the matter Shreya? You know I have a meeting today

317
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
那你為什麼一遍又一遍地給我打電話？
Then why are you calling me over and over?

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
我遇到了一個大問題，我現在不能來
I'm facing a huge problem here, I can't come right now

319
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,900
但至少告訴我怎麼了？
But at least tell me what's the matter?

320
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,950
好的，我來了，好的，我馬上到
Alright I'm coming, Yeah I'll be there

321
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,500
夥計們，我20分鍾後回來，如果普尼特有什麼消息給我打電話
Guys I'll be back in 20, Call me if Puneet comes up with anything

322
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,000
我們應該列一張嫌疑人的名單
We should make a list of probable suspects

323
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,000
那會有幫助嗎？
Would that help?

324
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
我有很多反盜竊的經驗
I have a lot of experience with larceny

325
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,500
我讀 MBA 一年級的時候，有人隔天就會偷我的水桶
When I was in MBA 1st year, someone used to steal my water bucket on alternate days

326
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,000
所以我列了一個錶並應用了基本定理，結果發現罪魁禍首是我的捨友
So I formed a list and applied base theorem, Turned out culprit was from my wing

327
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
我有預感是我們認識的人
I have a hunch its somebody we know

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
曼達爾，你的U盤呢？
Mandal, where's your pen drive?

329
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
我不知道，找不到了
I don't know, couldn't find it

330
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
我上周末遇到了拉斯托吉，從那以後...
I met Rastogi last weekend, since then its...

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
操！
FUCK!

332
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
每個演示和模闆都在裏麵
Each and every demo and templates were in it

333
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
現在就打給他
Call that Rastogi now

334
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
快點，你個白癡
Call him you moron

335
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
對不起
I'm sorry

336
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
開免提
Put it on speaker

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
他在班加羅爾，他就是在那裏偷走我們的想法的
He's in Bangalore, That's where he pitched our idea

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,300
媽的，我們現在一定要去班加羅爾嗎？
Shit, do we have to go to Bangalore now?

339
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
想去班加羅爾嗎？
Wanna go to Bangalore motherfucker?

340
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,000
是的，拉斯托吉可能正坐在咖啡店裏，對著你的名字打飛機
Yeah Rastogi might be sitting in a coffee shop, jerking off to your name

341
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
請不要這樣跟我說話
Please don't talk to me like that

342
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,500
我他媽打死你，你個傻逼
I'll beat your ass you cunt face

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
你要做的就是什麼都不做
All you had to do Mandal was nothing Nothing

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
你的工作就是什麼都不做，然而你還是搞砸了
That's all you had to do and you shit in that too

345
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
我從第一天開始就跟納文說我們不能把他算進去
I've been telling Naveen since day 1 that we shouldn't include him

346
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,220
我可以容忍他的零貢獻但我不能容忍他挖坑
I can tolerate his zero contribution But I can't put up with his negative contribution

347
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,400
本來我們現在應該拿到投資意嚮書了
We would've gotten the term sheet by now

348
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
誰給你的權利來攪亂我們的計劃？
Who gave you the right to fuck with our lives?

349
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,320
尤吉，你為什麼要這麼說，兄弟？
Yogi, why are you speaking like that, bro?

350
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,000
我已經很內疚了
I'm already feeling guilty

351
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,850
我不是故意的
I didn't do it on purpose

352
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,000
是，你不是故意的，知道為什麼嗎？
Yeah you can't do it on purpose, you know why?

353
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
因為你是個混蛋
Because you're a cunt

354
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,400
尤吉，夠了，別說了
Yogi its enough Hold on a second

355
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
你是個賤貨，全世界都知道你是個賤貨，你自己也知道你是個賤貨
You're a cunt The whole world knows that you're a cunt And you also know that you are a cunt

356
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,100
別這樣跟我說話，尤吉
Stop talking to me like that Yogi

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
是的，我知道我犯了錯誤.
Yes I know I made a mistake.

358
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,300
但我們是朋友...
But we are friends...

359
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
是嗎？
Really?

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,200
那麼除了我們之外，你的其他朋友呢？
Then where are your other friends besides us?

361
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
你為什麼偏偏找拉斯托吉一起喝酒？
And why did you find Rastogi, of all people to drink beer with?

362
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
你知道為什麼總是你的水桶被偷嗎？
Do you know why it was always your bucket that got stolen?

363
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
因為你就是個賤貨
Because you're a pussy

364
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
你是個大傻逼
You're the biggest douchebag out there

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
我們所遭受的這種摺磨是對你這種賤人加入我們隊伍的懲罰
This ordeal that we are suffering is a punishment for involving cunts like you in our team

366
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
那好吧
Okay then

367
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
你不用再為我受苦了
You won't have to suffer because of me again

368
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
和你們合作很愉快
It was great working with you guys

369
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
我不幹了
I quit

370
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
曼達爾...
Mandal...

371
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
尤吉，你不應該...
Yogi you shouldn't have...

372
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
- 曼達爾...-趕緊滾
- Mandal... - Get lost

373
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,500
做出明智的決定，永遠不要回來，你這該死的輸不起的家夥
Take a stand in your life just this once and don't ever come back you damn sore loser

374
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,150
你都幹了些什麼，尤吉？
What are you doing Yogi?

375
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,300
史瑞亞
Shreya

376
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
等一下等一下
Hold on a minute Just a sec

377
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
阿姨，你能把它移開嗎？
Aunty, can you move it?

378
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,000
你叫誰阿姨呢？
Who are you calling aunty?

379
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
大姐，你能把它移開嗎？
Madam, can you please move it?

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
我們去那邊
Come on that side

381
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,070
你這是在鬨什麼，你從來冇有這麼不講道理過
What is this nonsense? you've never been so unreasonable

382
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,600
我正在開會，你一直打電話過來
I was in the middle of a meeting and you kept calling over & over

383
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
還記得裏約熱內盧嗎? 我參加的那個麵試？
Remember Rio? That job interview I had?

384
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,000
怎麼了? 你不是已經拒絕了.
Yeah, what about that? You rejected it.

385
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,900
是的，但是他們的倫敦辦事處有新的空缺
Yes but they have new vacancies in their London office

386
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
他們希望我盡快趕過去
And they want me there ASAP

387
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
事實上，我必須在今晚之前去他們那報到
Infact, I have to get back to them by tonight, latest.

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
要去多久？
For how long?

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
我以為你在這裏很開心？
I thought you were happy here?

390
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,000
我當然很開心，但是...
I am... Ofcourse I am, but...

391
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,900
納文，這是一個夢幻城市的理想工作
Naveen, its a dream job in a dream city

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
這是一生中隻有一次的機會
Its like a once in a lifetime opportunity

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
你決定了嗎？
Have you decided then?

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
我不知道
I don't know

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,670
我真不敢相信我要在...
I can't believe I have to choose between...

396
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
我的未來和我們的未來之間做選擇
My future and our future

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,300
我不想一個人做出這樣的選擇
And I don't want to make that choice all by myself

398
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,900
現在我能說什麼呢，這是你的決定
What can I say now, its your decision

399
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
如果你是我，你會怎麼做？
What would you have done if you were in my place?

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
我想你應該去
I think you should go

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
曼達爾手機關機了
Mandal's phone is switched off

402
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
你為什麼對他發那麼大火，尤吉？
Why do you flip out so much Yogi?

403
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,300
他哪兒也不會去，喝了幾杯啤酒就回家了
He's not gonna go anywhere, he'll be home after a couple of beers

404
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,000
尤吉，如果他做了什麼蠢事你負的起責任嗎？
Yogi, He's Mandal Will you take responsibility if he did anything stupid?

405
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
混蛋回來了
There's your asshole

406
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
一定是桑亞，我讓她麵試結束後來這裏
Must be Soumya, I told her to come here after the interview

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
聽著，閉上你的臭嘴，我不想讓她被你嚇到
Listen, keep your trap shut, I don't want her to get in a stew

408
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,000
我通過了
I got it

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
麵試很順利，他們會給我發offer，下周入職
Interview was amazing, they are gonna send me an offer letter and I'm gonna join by next week

410
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
恭喜你桑亞... 恭喜
Congrats Soumya... Congrats

411
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
對不起，尤吉，我冇看見你
I'm sorry Yogi, I didn't see you

412
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
不，不，你們繼續，我去裏麵
No no, you guys carry on I'll be inside

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
不，不，冇關係的，這個給你
No no, its allright Actually this is for you

414
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
裏麵是什麼，糖果嗎？
What's in it? sweets?

415
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
不，這些是打印店寄來的名片，他們早上送來的
No, these are visiting cards from Vista prints, they delievered it in the morning

416
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
實際上他告訴我以前的卡質量很差，所以...
Actually he told me that the quality of previous cards was quite shoddy so...

417
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
你們會議開得怎麼樣？
How did the meeting go?

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,500
非常棒，演示相當不錯 -演示非常棒的，所以...
It was great, presentation went pretty well Demo was amazing so..

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
總之我們做得很好，他很喜歡
We pitched it well, he liked it

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
是的，聊得很愉快
Yeah meeting was great

421
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
你和爸爸談過了嗎？
Did you talk to Dad?

422
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,000
冇有
No

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,800
其實隻有在我爸問到你和你爸的時候才能聊幾句
Actually I could talk to my Dad only He was asking about you and dad

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
我有預感爸爸知道這件事
I have a hunch that dad knows about it

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
所以，我想我應該先和你談談，然後再和爸爸談
So, I think first I should talk to you and then dad

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
為什麼，你應該先和爸爸談談
Why? you should talk to dad first

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
你們是怎麼分辨出說的是誰爸爸呢？
How can you married couple can tell the difference between whose dad we're talking about

428
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
好吧，我會跟爸爸說的，但是我應該怎麼說？
Okay, I'll talk to dad but should I say?

429
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
說你經常說的話
Say what you always say

430
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,000
我知道我們不同意他的意見，但我們不能不尊重他.你應該給他打電話
I know we disagree with him but we don't disrespect him. You should call him

431
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
普尼特來電話了
Puneet is calling

432
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,400
普尼特，我是尤吉
Yeah, hi Puneet Its Yogi here

433
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,000
餵，聽著，尤吉，我不能直接找到名字
Yeah look Yogi, I couldn't find the name directly

434
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,500
但是我這有巴德瓦伊上周的日程安排
But I have Bhardwaj's last week schedule right in front of me

435
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,500
我有他以前所有會麵的詳細情況
I have the details of all of his previous meetings

436
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
你能查一下他是否和拉斯托吉見過麵嗎？
Can you check if he had any meeting with Rastogi?

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
查查有冇有叫拉斯托吉的
Yeah, check for a Rastogi

438
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
不，不，拉斯托吉有一個 r，是的
No no Rastogi with an R, yes

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
冇有拉斯托吉
There's no Rastogi here Yogi

440
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
冇有拉斯托吉？
No Rastogi?

441
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
你按字母順序檢查一下? 從 a 開始挨個念一遍
Why don't you check alphabetically? and tell me the names starting from A

442
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,400
這裏有將近80個名字，我已經交叉核對過了
There are almost 80 names here, I have already cross checked the list

443
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
他們要麼是大公司，要麼是已經註資的創業公司
Either they are big companies or already funded startups

444
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,000
隻剩下一個冇有名字的，隻有一個電子郵箱
There's only one slot left with no name but just an Email ID

445
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
什麼是電子郵箱？
What is the Email ID?

446
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
某種特殊的身份，是的...
Some peculiar ID, yes...

447
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
地下城主@hotmail. com 地下城和主人之間有一個下劃線
dungeon_master@hotmail.com there's an underscore between dungeon and master

448
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,370
我操！！！
FUCK!!!!!!!!!!

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
哦，操！
Oh fuck!

450
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,870
你為什麼選擇這個地方來談論這麼重要的事情
Why did you choose this place to talk about such an important matter

451
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,120
我們本可以去餐廳聊的
We could've gone to a restaurant

452
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
也許是因為我想跟你走一次紅毯
Maybe because I wanted to walk down the aisle with you once

453
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,000
很好，你的幽默感還在
Good to know, that your sense of humour is still intact

454
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,000
你的“事業第一”思想仍然保持著我也很欣慰
And good to see, that your "career comes first" ideology is still intact

455
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
納文！
Naveeeeeen!

456
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
說出來吧
Please say it

457
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,000
隻要說一次我愛你，冇有你我活不下去，請不要離開我
Just say it once that I love you, I can't live without you, please don't leave me

458
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,000
史瑞雅，我愛你，冇有你我活不下去
Shreya, I love you, I can't live without you

459
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
但是請你走吧
But please go

460
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,500
我們會想辦法的
We'll try and figure out something

461
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,500
比如什麼？
Like what?

462
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
異地戀？
Long distance?

463
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,000
你知道那是行不通的
You know that never works

464
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
我可能再也不會回來了
I might never come back

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,500
你不能搬到那裏，我也不能呆在這裏
You can't move there and I can't be here

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
我們不要把問題簡單化，好嗎？
Let's not try to take the easy way out, okay?

467
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,000
還有時間，我給你一枚硬幣，你去找個審判室做個決定
There's still time. I'll give you a coin, make the trial room your jury room

468
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
這改變不了什麼
That is not gonna change anything

469
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,500
我太了解你了，這就是問題所在
I know you too well you know thats the problem

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,500
你知道嗎，你變得越來越可預測了
You're getting very predictable you know

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,400
你說不動我的，別說了
You're not instigating me, please stop trying

472
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
聽著，真的嗎? ，你要放我走? ，我？
Listen, really? You're letting me go? me?

473
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
你要讓這個，這個，這個，還有那個走了？
You're letting this and this and these and that go?

474
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,500
你知道得到這個組合有多難嗎？
Do you realize how tough it is to get this combination?

475
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
不是難，而是不可能的
It won't be tough, it will be impossible

476
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,300
但這是你的工作，你必須要去
But its your job You have to do it

477
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
你的工作是你死後唯一長久存在的東西
You know that your work is the only thing that will be here long after you're gone

478
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
納文，那隻是一種比喻
Naveen, that's just a figure of speech

479
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,120
我們不是甘地，牛頓或者莎士比亞
We're not Gandhi, Newton or Shakespeare

480
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,920
我們的工作隻是一起白頭到老，就這麼簡單
Our work is just gonna get buried with our graves Its as simple as that

481
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,620
不是的，史瑞雅
That is not true Shreya

482
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,570
等一下
Hold on a minute

483
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,000
這是什麼？
What is this?

484
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
你的頭
Your head

485
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,900
認真點
What nonsense?

486
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,000
告訴我這是什麼？
Go on tell me what's this?

487
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,400
這是一個瓶子，怎麼了？
Its a bottle, what else?

488
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,000
誰造出來的？
Who built it?

489
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
我怎麼知道？
How would I know?

490
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,900
你知道1000年前人類住在山洞裏的時候...
You know when man used to live in caves 1000 years ago...

491
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
你在開玩笑嗎? ，我們要回到一仟年前，是嗎？
Are you kidding me? We are going that back, are we?

492
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
是的，聽我說
Yeah we are going that back Listen to me

493
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,100
山洞裏的人覺得從河裏取水很費勁
He would find it arduous to draw water from the rivers

494
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,320
有人就用樹葉做了一個裝水的容器，但不耐用
Then someone made a water container made of leaves But it wasn't durable

495
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
然後有人註意到，把濕土暴露在陽光直射下會變成粘土
Then someone noticed that exposing wet soil to direct sunlight turns it into clay

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
所以有人用這種粘土做了一個罐子
And then someone else made a pot from that very clay

497
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,000
但這也不是長久之計
But that wasn't durable either

498
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,400
後來有人發明了塑料
Then someone invented plastic

499
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
有人就認為塑料可以做成耐用的容器
And then someone else thought plastic would make a durable container

500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
然後有人設計了它的形狀，另一個人把它變成透明的
Then someone else designed its shape, another person made it transparent

501
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,000
有人設計了蓋子，有人設計了擰蓋子的線路
Someone discovered the caps, and someone designed the threads of the cap

502
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,000
有人建造了一個製造瓶子的工廠
And someone made a whole factory to manufacture bottles

503
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,000
成仟上萬的人工作，就為了製造這些瓶子
in which thousands of people work just to make these bottles

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
成仟上萬的人工作了這麼多年，史瑞雅，所以我們今天有瓶子可以用
Millions of people have been working for so many years, Shreya so that we can make use of these bottles

505
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
也許我們不想承認，但是...
Maybe we don't acknowledge it but...

506
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
一代又一代人的工作成果還保留在世上
...there work is still here long after they're gone

507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
這隻是一個瓶子，史瑞雅
And this is just a bottle, Shreya

508
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,500
看看你的周圍，你正站在人類工作曆史的博物館
look at your surroundings You're standing at a museum of human work history

509
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
看看周圍
Just look around

510
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,000
還有什麼更好的地方能證明你的觀點呢？
And what better place to prove your point, right?

511
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
你總是對的，班薩爾先生
Like always you're right Mr. Bansal

512
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
你會想我嗎？
Will you miss me?

513
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,200
也許在某些寂寞的夜晚
On some lonely nights, maybe

514
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
你呢？
You?

515
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
每天晚上都想
Every night

516
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
死鬼
Pervert prick

517
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
好吧，我得做點什麼
Well, I'll have to do something

518
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
答應我，在你開始和別人約會之前，給我三個月的時間
Promise me that you'll give me a window of 3 months before you start seeing someone else

519
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,000
好吧，你也不要在倫敦瘋狂發自拍
Okay, and you also don't go on a selfie spree once you're in London

520
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
好的
Okay done

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,900
我們是靈魂伴侶，對吧？
We were sort of a soulmates type, right?

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,800
如果我在這裏，我們肯定會結婚
We would be marrying for sure if I had been here

523
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
感謝上帝，冇有讓這種事發生
Thank god it didn't happen

524
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,870
所以，嚴格來說，我們要分手了
So, technically we're breaking up

525
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,770
我們從來冇有涉及到技術細節，寶貝
We never got into technicalities baby

526
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,000
不，我這麼說是因為...
No, I'm saying that because...

527
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,000
這是分手炮了
...it makes for a breakup sex for one last time

528
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,000
當然
Ofcourse

529
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,000
我今晚要回家一個星期，等我回來再說
I'm leaving for home tonight for one week, We'll get to that once I'm back

530
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,050
不管怎樣，我下周就要走了...
Anyway, I'll be leaving next week...

531
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,000
好吧聽著
Okay, listen

532
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,900
我想我該走了
I think I should go now

533
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
我晚上還要趕飛機，還冇開始收拾行李呢
I have a flight to catch in the evening and I haven't even started packing yet

534
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,000
好嗎？
Okay?

535
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
我明天再打電話給你
I'll talk to you tomorrow

536
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
納文...
Listen...

537
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
拿著這個
Here, keep this

538
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,900
- 這是什麼?-密碼1767
- What's this? - 1767 (*PIN no.)

539
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
你為什麼給我你的信用卡? 別鬨？
Why are you giving me your credit card? what nonsense?

540
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
不要在我麵前逞英雄，我知道你的經濟狀況
Don't be a hero in front of me, I know your financial situation

541
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,750
食品雜貨我管你一個月，好嗎？
Groceries are on me for a month, okay?

542
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
這不是禮物，我是借給你的
And its not a gift, I'm giving you a loan

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,120
你可以以後再付我錢
You can pay me later

544
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
好嗎？
Okay?

545
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,400
納文
Naveen

546
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
納文，別這樣，別在這兒好嗎？
Naveen don't do this, not here, okay?

547
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
你知道我不能就這樣離開
You know I can't leave like this

548
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
怎麼了？
What happened?

549
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,000
為了創業，我不得不做出很多犧牲
I had to do a lot of sacrifices for the startup

550
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,000
我放棄了一份體麵的工作，體麵的薪水，良好的生活條件
I gave up a decent job, decent salary, good stantard of living

551
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
這些都無所謂
And it never bothered me

552
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
但是現在你為我的工作犧牲了
But now you are sacrificing for my work

553
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
這讓我很心疼
It hurts me a lot

554
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
疼得要命
Hurts like hell

555
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
但是如果不疼，那就不算犧牲了，不是嗎？
But if didn't hurt then its not gonna be a sacrifice, right?

556
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,900
總有一天你會登上時代雜誌的封麵
And there'll be a time when you're gonna be on the cover of TIME magazine

557
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
那這一切都值了
then this'll all seem worth it

558
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,000
但是一定要確保這一點，好嗎？
But just please make sure that happens, okay?

559
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
為了我們，好嗎？
For us, Okay?

560
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
再見，我會打電話給你
Bye, I'll call you

561
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800
我說我最近怎麼收到很多生發廣告的電子郵件
Thats why I was getting a lot of Emails lately regarding Hair therapy

562
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
他從6個月前就開始整我了
He's been fucking with me since 6 months

563
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
你之前還打算用他來取代我？
And you were gonna replace me with him?

564
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
是的，因為冇錢
Yeah because of financial crunch

565
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
你要嘗試道歉，尤吉
Learn to apologize, Yogi

566
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
不，道歉太蠢了
Nah, apologies are stupid

567
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,000
但我敢肯定，當我踩在他們屁股上的時候，這些混蛋會道歉的
But I'm sure these assholes will be grovelling when I'll stamp their asses with my shoes

568
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,000
尤吉，拜托，你冷靜一下
Yogi please, you ought to be calm

569
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,000
你從早上起就心情不好，讓我來處理吧
You're in a black mood since morning, let me handle this with patience

570
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
好吧，但是如果他們激怒我，我他媽搞死他們
Okay but if they aggravated me, I'll fuck their shit up

571
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
他們隻有17歲，我要勸勸他們
They are only 17 years old kids, I'll talk some sense into them

572
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
好吧，你先說，說不通我在動手，好嗎? ，我們走
Allright, you talk and I'll kick Okay? lets go

573
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,000
他們很幸運，我今天冇穿運動鞋
And they're lucky that I didn't put on my woodland shoes today

574
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
這裏到底發生了什麼？
The fuck happened here?

575
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
上次那些笨蛋在哪裏？
Where are those blockheads from last time?

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
- 那是什麼?-看起來是屎
What's that? Looks like someone took a shit here

577
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
來吧，快點，我們做正事
Come on hurry up, lets do our business

578
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
來了老弟，我們等你半天了
Come Yogi, come we were waiting for you

579
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
你們知道我們要來嗎？
you guys knew we were coming?

580
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
不，不，我們隻是喜歡每天晚上8點到10點這樣坐著
No no, we just like to sit like this everynight from 8 to 10

581
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,500
我們這裏有大門的監控
We got a hold of main gate's CCTV surveilance right here

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,300
寶貝，你的華麗出場可以了，我能走了嗎？
Baby, you got your dramatic entry, Can I go now?

583
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
好吧
Yeah okay

584
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
你晚上會帶我去泡溫泉，對嗎？
you're taking me to spa in the evening, right?

585
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
班娜麗，我在工作
Banali, I'm working

586
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
小夥子們...
Look guys...

587
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
你知道我們為什麼來這裏
You know why we are here

588
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
我們費了很大力氣才創造出那種産品
It took a lot of elbow grease for us to make that product

589
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,000
你們犯了一個錯誤，這也是違法的
You guys did a mistake and its illegal too

590
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,000
你們隻是大學生，我們不會告你的
And you guys are just kids in college, we're not gonna lodge a complaint against you

591
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,000
你隻是犯了個錯誤，冇關係.
You made a mistake, its alright.

592
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,500
你隻需要打電話給巴德瓦伊，跟他說退出
You just need to call Bhardwaj and backout

593
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
放鬆，我們不會對你採取任何行動
Relax, we're not taking any action against you

594
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,000
傑圖，這家夥很可愛
Jeetu, this guy is very cute

595
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,000
如果你追蹤這個 IP 地址，你會查到穆倫德的網吧
If you'll track the IP address, you'll get Mulund's cyber cafe

596
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
你冇有任何籌碼
You ain't got shit on me

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,500
聽著，我們有證據錶明這是我們的主意
Look, we have all the proofs which claims that this is our idea

598
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,000
我告訴你們是為了你們好，你們都上大學了
I'm telling you for your own good, you guys are in college

599
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,000
當你父母知道這件事的時候，你會有麻煩的
You'll get into trouble when your parents get to know about it

600
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,500
我不怕我的父母
i'm not scared of my parents

601
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,000
如果我們的父母有足夠的時間來管我們...
If our parents had enough time to reprove us...

602
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,000
那你就不會和我這樣的小屁孩打交道了
...then you wouldn't be dealing with a brat like me

603
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300
等一下，傑圖，把你的電話給我
Hold on a second, Jeetu Give me your phone

604
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
把你的電話給我，我會告訴這些混蛋該打給誰.救護車還是巴德瓦伊？
Give me your phone and I'll tell these fucks who to call. Ambulance or Bhardwaj?

605
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
把你手機給我
Give me your phone

606
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,000
你見過雷迪嗎？
have you met Reddy?

607
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
雷迪非常喜歡視頻聊天
Reddy was very fond of video chatting

608
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,800
他在陌陌上哄騙了一個保加利亞女孩
He cajoled a Bulgarian girl on omegle

609
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
然後每天晚上他都會和她視頻聊天做一些下流的事...
And then every night he used to skype with her, doing some nasty nasty...

610
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,500
但他不知道我錄下了所有的視頻
But little did he know that I was recording all the chats

611
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
有一天...
And one day...

612
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,000
我把所有的視頻聊天都上傳到了網上
I uploaded all the video chats on the internet

613
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,000
我費了好大勁才把那些視頻撤下來
It took him a lot of grovelling to do for me to take those videos down

614
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
這可是我最好的朋友
And this is my best friend we're talking about

615
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
而你是我父親第三個堂兄的共同朋友
While you are a mutual friend of my father's third cousin

616

斯維特拉娜是個單身母親
Svetlana is a single mom

618
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,900
在很多方麵也是一個企業家
And also an entrepreneur in many ways

619
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,300
41G的視頻，雷迪剛剛為它買了一個新的硬盤
41gb material, Reddy just got a new hard drive for it

620
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,000
在這些欲火中燒的日子裏真的太感謝她了，幫我跟她說聲謝謝
It helped a lot during dry day, say her thanks for me

621
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
別動哦，尤吉
Dare not touch, Yogi

622
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,900
我的新電腦有免費的路由器
Got a free router with my new computer

623
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,300
想試試上傳速度嗎？
Wanna test the upload speed?

624
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
老哥們，拜托了
Guys, please...

625
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
比爾坑了史蒂夫，創建了微軟
Bill stomped on Steve to create Microsoft

626
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,200
所以你們是誰？
Then who are you?

627
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,200
滾吧
Go back the same way you came

628
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,000
如果你試圖聯係巴德瓦伊.
If you even tried to contact Bhardwaj...

629
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,500
那麼尤吉和斯維特拉娜的文件夾就不僅僅在雷迪的硬盤裏了
...then Yogi-Svetlana's folder won't only be in Reddy's hard drive

630
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
好吧，我們走
Okay, lets go

631
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,000
混蛋

還想讓我退出
Telling me to backout

634
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
嘿 傑圖，別走啊，我還冇被說服呢
Hey Jeetu, come on I'm not convinced yet

635
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,000
來說服我，讓我退出
Come and convince me that I should backout

636

說服我啊，混蛋

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

642
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
這個混蛋讓我說服他
This motherfucker asked me to convince him

643
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,500
首先我說服了我的妻子，然後是我的父親，然後是我的家人
First I convinced my wife, then my dad, then my family

644
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
這癟犢子才他媽17歲
Son of a bitch is just 17

Motherfucker, my i7-4790k edition

646
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
你們是什麼人? ，流氓嗎？
What are you? some gangsters?

647
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,100
我們不是流氓
We're not gangsters

648
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
我們是企業家
We are entrepreneurs, motherfucker

649
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
你知道讓孩子上幼兒園要花多少錢嗎？
You know how much it costs to get your child into junior KG?

650
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
你們了解過房屋抵押嗎？
Do you have any idea about house mortgaging?

651
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,300
我昨天去了雜貨店
I went to the grocery store yesterday

652
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,000
你知道小玉米要多少錢嗎？
You know how much does baby corn cost?

653
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,900
每100克120盧比
Rs 120 per 100 grams

654
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
哦，天哪，每公斤1200盧比? 該死！
Oh my, Rs 1200 per kg? Damn!

655
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
我的需求是什麼？
What did I want?

656
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:43,000
你拿到你的種子基金，我升職，這要求過分嗎？
That you get your seed fund and I get my promotion, Is that too much to ask for?

657
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
幾乎冇有任何難度，而且1/4的團隊成員已經辭職了
You hardly faced a challenge and 25% percent of the team has resigned already

658
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,300
普尼特，他手機關機了，跟我們有什麼關係
Puneet, he has switched off his phone, how is that our fault?

659
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
納文，跟他講講道理
Naveen, talk some sense itno him dude

660
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
我已經不想說話了，你講吧
I'm tired of talking now, you should do it

661
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
這就是我要支持的團隊嗎？
Is this the team that I've advocated for?

662
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,900
這位首席執行官參加會議時甚至冇有洗澡或梳洗一番
This CEO attends meeting without even taking a shower or freshen up

663
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
這位首席運營官滿嘴髒話還欺負人
This CEO curses and bullies people

664
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,300
這個首席技術官瘋狂砸電腦
This CTO vandalizes the computers

665
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
看起來是一個百萬美元的團隊，為什麼還冇有人投你們呢？
This seems like a million dollar team, howcome no one has decided to fund you yet?

666
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,000
普尼特，他來了
Puneet, he's coming

667
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
好吧，過去的就讓它過去吧，隻是不要告訴巴德瓦伊
Alright let bygones be bygones, just don't say anything to Bhardwaj

668
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,000
我來說，好嗎？
I'll do the talking, okay?

669
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,500
好了，我們走
Okay lets go

670
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,500
你還好嗎? ，你看起來很沮喪
Are you alright? you seem gloomy

671
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
嗨，對不起，我被電話拖住了
Hi guys, sorry I got stuck on a call

672
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
你們怎麼樣？
How're you guys doing?

673
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,900
很好，先生
Good, sir

674
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
曼達爾在哪裏...
Where is uhh...

675
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,000
曼達爾身體不適，所以他今天不能參加了
Uhh Manda...uhh Saurabh is unwell actually so he won't be joining us today

676
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
好的，冇問題
Okay, no problem

677
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
安基特，我和納文談過了，他們真的想重新談談條件
Ankit, I was talking to Naveen and these guys really want to renegotiate the terms

678
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,400
普尼特，你能不參加這次會議嗎？
Puneet, can you sit this one out?

679
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,300
我真的很抱歉，但我想直接和他們談談
I'm really sorry but I want to talk to the guys directly

680
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
所以，如果你能休息一下，那就太好了
So, if you can take a break, it'd be great

681
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
我知道這對你來說意義重大，你為你的産品付出了很多
I know this means a lot to you, you've worked very hard on your product

682
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,000
而且，我真的很感激你們所做的努力
And, I really appreciate the amount of hard work that you've put in

683
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
但是...
But...

684
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
昨晚我和另一隊聊了一下然後...
Last night I had a chat with the other team And...

685
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
他們現在給了我一個更好的條件
They are offering me a much better deal now

686
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,200
從現在開始我就可以直接擁有那家公司了
From here on I can virtually own that company

687
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,000
所以... 我冇有理由不投資他們
So... I have no reason why I shouldn't invest in them

688
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,700
但是你不認為他們的所作所為是違法的嗎？
But don't you think sir its.. what they have done is illegal?

689
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
就像我們的産品已經註冊了專利，應該受到專利法保護……
Like we've got our product registered and there are copywrite laws...

690
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,300
你可以複製一個産品，但你不能複製一個想法
You can copywrite a product but you can't copywrite an idea

691
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,900
在網上銷售商品是一個想法
Selling goods online is an idea

692
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
但是 Flipkart，Snapdeal，亞馬遜，他們都用
But Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon they are all selling it

693
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,300
先生，我認為，這對我們非常不公平
I think sir its extremely unfair to us

694
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,000
- 我們做出的努力...-聽著夥計們...
-Like we've been working on this for... -Look guys...

695
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,000
作為一個人，我真的為你感到難過
As a human being, I genuinely feel sorry for you

696
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,500
但作為一個投資者，我不能讓這種感覺阻礙我
But as an investor, I can't let that feeling come in my way

697
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,000
如果我想做生意，那麼我應該為自己的利益著想，對嗎？
And if I want to do a business then I ought to look out for my self interest, right?

698
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,000
普尼特從一開始就知道這件事
Sir like, Puneet knew about it since the beginning

699
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,900
我能進來嗎，先生？
May I come in, sir?

700
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
曼達爾？
Saurabh?

701
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
我以為你病了
I thought you were sick

702
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
很抱歉你大老遠跑來...
Too bad you came all the way because...

703
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
我隻有壞消息要告訴你
I have nothing but bad news for you

704
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
冇關係，先生，我可以給您做個演示嗎？
Its okay sir, but can I give you a presentation?

705
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,000
演示? 我隻是告訴他們我已經下定決心了，冇有必要...
Presentation? I just told them that I've made up my mind and there's no point in...

706
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
求你了，先生
Please sir

707
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,000
我花了35000盧比買回來的
I spent Rs 35000 to make this presentation

708
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,300
我知道你已經看過了所有的公司文件，但是先生，這個演示將使我們公司上一個臺階
I know you have seen all the company documents but sir this will make our company really big

709
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
我隻需要兩分鍾，先生
I'll need just 2 minutes sir

710
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
好吧，開始吧
Alright, go ahead

711
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
【納文的團隊】作者: 曼達爾
Naveen's Team by Saurabh Mandal

712
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,700
這個團隊由4名成員組成
This team consists of 4 members

713
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,700
納文·班薩爾
Naveen Bansal

714
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
傑圖德拉·馬赫什瓦裏
Jitendra Maheshwari

715
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
尤吉德拉 · 庫馬爾 · 潘迪
Yogendra Kumar Pandey

716
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,000
還有我，索拉佈 · 曼達爾
And me, Saurabh Mandal

717
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,000
讓我們從傑圖開始
Let's begin with Jeetu

718
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,300
我們每個人的生活中都有一個知識分子的兒子
All of us have a Mr Sharma's son(*Stereotypical intellectual son) in our life

719
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
但是在比卡內爾的政府高中，有一位馬赫什瓦裏先生的兒子
But in Bikaner's Government high school, there was a Mr Maheshwari's son

720
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
傑圖德拉·馬赫什瓦裏
Jitendra Maheshwari

721
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,000
先生，我從來冇有看過後街男孩的現場錶演
Sir, I've never seen a live performance of Backstreet Boys

722
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
但是我看到過傑圖寫代碼
But I've seen Jeetu writing code

723
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
連續36小時不睡覺
Continuously for 36 hours, without any sleep

724
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,900
他本可以去美國為 facebook 工作
He could've easily gone to US to work for facebook

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
但他為了家庭冇有離開印度
But he didn't leave India for his family's sake

726
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,000
畢竟他是個顧家的人
Afterall he is a family man

727
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,000
現在，這是他有生以來第一次為了這家創業公司與家人作對
And now for the first time in his life he went against his family for this startup

728
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
為什麼? 他為什麼這麼做？
Why? Why did he do it?

729
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,000
尤吉
Yogi

730
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,300
先生，有些人認識的人很少
Sir, some people know very few people

731
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,600
有些人認識的人很多
Some people know most of the people

732
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,700
但是尤吉認識所有人
But Yogi knows everyone

733
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
納文告訴我，當他們訪問古吉拉特時，尤吉安排在淩晨4點喝啤酒
Naveen told me that when they visited Gujarat(*Dry state) Yogi arranged for a beer at 4 in the morning

734
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,000
我從尤吉那裏學到了很多關於削減成本的知識，而不是在MBA課程學來的
I learned more about Cost cutting from Yogi than from my MBA lectures

735
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,100
他買了一塊二十五裏拉的蛋糕作為生日禮物
He bought a cake of just Rs. 25 for his birthday

736
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,000
他的平均 gpa 隻有5.3(滿分10分)
He had a CGPA of just 5.3(out of 10)

737
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,000
但是他年薪220萬盧比
But he got a salary package of Rs 2.2 million

738
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,500
如果他在那裏工作的話，兩年內他就會成為孟買的地區負責人
He would've been the Mumbai regional head in just 2 years had he been working there

739
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
但是他為什麼要離開他的工作去創業呢？ 為什麼他要竭盡全力這個創業公司奮鬥？
But then why did he leave his job for this startup? Why is he fighting tooth and nail for this startup?

740
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
難道是為了加快脫發？
Only to let his hair fall?

741
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,000
為什麼？
Why?

742
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
最後
And finally

743
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
納文·班薩爾
Naveen Bansal

744
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,000
我喜歡看電影
I love watching movies

745
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,900
每部電影的結尾都有"由xx指導"的一行字
In the end of every movie, there's director's name written under "A film by"

746
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,400
我過去常常因為看到這個而生氣
I used to get angry by seeing that

747
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,400
我是說...
I mean...

748
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,000
演員錶演，編劇寫劇本，攝影師拍攝
Actor acts, writer writes and cinematographer shoots the film

749
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,000
那麼導演做了什麼使他得到如此特別的關註呢
Then what does the director do that he gets such a special attention

750
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
他所要做的就是做選擇，好還是壞
All he has to do is to make a choice Good or bad

751
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,000
但是納文意識到，選擇是生活中最具挑戰性的事情
But Naveen has realised me that choices are the most challenging things in life

752
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,400
先生，這整件事都是納文的主意
Sir, this whole idea is Naveen's

753
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,000
這是他的産品
This is his product

754
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,000
這是他的團隊
This is his team

755
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,000
我們都可以為他擋子彈
If there's anyone in this world for whom we all can take a bullet

756
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,000
這就是坐在這裏的那位先生
This is the gentleman sitting over here

757
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
為了這個團隊，他把我們的家庭辦公室和他自己的家變成了一個倉庫
For this team, he made our home office and his own home was turned itno a warehouse

758
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,500
這就是那個不喜歡自己熨襯衫的人，他現在自願幫我們洗所有的衣服
This is the man who didn't like to iron his own shirts, who now volunteers to launder all of our clothes

759
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,600
我們所有人都為彼此做出了很多犧牲
All of us have done a lot of sacrifices for each other

760
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
但是納文為了保護我們所做的遠不止這些
But Naveen has done a lot more than that to shield us

761
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,900
為什麼納文要這麼做？
Why is Naveen doing all this?

762
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
我們為什麼要這麼做？
All of us

763
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,000
為什麼我們所有人都對這家創業公司如此執著？
Why all of us are so hell-bent for this startup?

764
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
我來告訴你為什麼，先生
I'll tell you why sir

765
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,400
因為我們都想到達這裏
Because we all want to reach here

766
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,900
我們不會等任何船
And we're not waiting for any boat

767
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
我們已經在未知的海洋中漂流
We're already swimming in the sea of unknown

768
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
我們早就離開了我們的舒適區
We've already left our comfort zone long ago

769
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,600
現在我們不關心我們將要麵對的變化、挑戰或犧牲
Now we don't care about the changes, challenges or sacrifices we'll have to face

770
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,400
無論如何
No matter what

771
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
我們的隊伍會到達這裏，奇跡發生的地方
Our team will reach here, where magic happens

772
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
你在你的團隊裏是做什麼的？
And what do you do in your team?

773
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
先生，我個人冇有任何價值
Sir, I don't have any value individually

774
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
我是空氣
I'm a zero

775
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
但是我的加入使公司淨值增加了10倍
But the net value increases by 10 times when I add up

776
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
你已經說得很清楚了
You've made your point

777
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,000
現在讓我把我的觀點再強調一下
Now let me make my point very clear

778
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
不管哪支隊伍來到這裏
No matter which team gets here

779
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,900
最終我將塑造他們的想法，讓他們成為一個更大的公司
It's ultimately going to be me who's going to shape their idea and make them a bigger company

780
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
這需要業務專業知識來構建這些東西
You need business business expertise to build this things

781
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
聽起來可能很傲慢，但讓我告訴你們
And, at the risk of sounding arrogant let me tell you guys that

782
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
我選擇的團隊一定是最強的
The team which I shall support, that team would be the strongest

783
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,500
這個團隊必將成為一個更大的公司
And that team will make a bigger company

784
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
我想你們忘了，我已經決定投資另一隊了
And I think you guys are forgetting that, I've already decided to back the other team

785
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,500
先生，你還忘了一件事
Sir, you're also forgetting something

786
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
你的島不是海裏唯一的島嶼
Yours is not the only island in the sea

787
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,000
還有其他神奇的島嶼
There are other magical islands

788
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,500
他們也很願意拉我們上岸
Who'll be more than happy to have us on the shore

789
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
所以你是說...
So you're saying that...

790
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
還有其他投資者有投資意嚮？
You've offers from other investors as well?

791
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,500
先生，你真的認為我們隻嚮一個投資者展示産品嗎？
Sir, do you really think that we presented our product to just one investor?

792
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
這些投資者到底是誰？
And who are these investors exactly?

793
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
對不起，先生，我現在不能透露他們的名字
Sorry sir, I can't reveal their names at this point of time

794
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,000
你們知道我的名聲
You know my reputation guys

795
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,000
如果我拒絕你的想法，那麼冇有人敢在這裏給你們投資
If I reject your idea, then no one will dare to invest here with you

796
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,500
先生，你知道我們的毅力
And sir you know our perseverance

797
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,700
我們一定會上岸的
We'll surely make it up to there

798
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,000
無論是在你的投資組合中還是在你的反投資組合中
Either in your portfolio or in your anti-portfolio

799
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,450
我經常玩撲克
I play poker a lot

800
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
我一看就知道你是在虛張聲勢
I know a bluff when I see one

801
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
你冇有別的選擇
You have no other offers

802
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,500
你在利用我害怕失敗的心理
You're trying to play on my fear of losing out

803
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,500
事實就是...
When the fact is...

804
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
除了我
Apart from me

805
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,000
你無處可去
You've nowhere else to go

806
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
好吧，被你識破了
Sir, the ball is still in your court

807
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,200
呆在這兒，曼達爾，你要去哪兒？
Stay here Mandal, where are you going?

808
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,000
不，我要回家
No, I'm going home

809
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,000
我得起草一份正式的辭職信
I have to draft a formal resignation letter

810
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,500
你的“毅力”和“上岸”哪去了？
Whatever happened to your "perseverance" and "making up to the island"?

811
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,500
我們要你留下你還非要走
Now that we're telling you to stay, you're walking out

812
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
不，過多的情感依戀是不好的
No, too much emotional attachment is bad

813
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,500
無論發生了什麼，都是最好的結果
Whatever happened, happened for the best

814
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,900
坐下，混蛋
Sit-down asshole

815
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
你冇聽見我說話嗎，混蛋，回來
Didn't you hear me asshole? come back

816
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,500
如果我是個混蛋，你為什麼還要我留下？
Why do you want me to stay if I'm an asshole?

817
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,000
因為你是我的朋友，混蛋
Because you're my friend motherfucker

818
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,900
過來，坐下
Come on now, sit-down here

819
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,900
我不會的
I won't

820
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
那隻是一個演示，現在不要想逞英雄
It was just a presentation, don't try to be a hero now

821
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,900
我昨天心情不好，回來吧
I was in a black mood yesterday, come on back here

822
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
我說了我不會
I said I won't

823
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,500
我知道我昨天反應過度了，試著理解我在說什麼
I know I overreacted yesterday, try to understand what I'm saying

824
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
理解什麼？
understand what?

825
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,000
我說對不起，混蛋
That I'm saying sorry motherfucker

826
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
現在給我回來，不然我揍你
Now come back here or I'll whoop your ass

827
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
冇關係，我原諒你
It's okay I forgive you

828
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
我們拿到了
We got it

829
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
我們成功了，傑圖
We go it Jeetu

830
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
我要倒了
Guys put me down

831
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
我告訴過你我的U盤能做什麼
I told you what my pen drive could do

832
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,000
幹杯
Cheers

833
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,900
哥幾個，今晚不醉不歸
Let's take about 10 such pitchers to home, we'll get some fine quality beer with a lot of froth

834
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,600
我們隻有10% 的種子基金，別在文書工作之前搞砸了
We've only got 10% of the seed fund, don't fuck this up before paperwork

835
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,000
這話出自一個最近在青年旅社砸電腦的家夥之口
Says the guy who recently fucked it up in a hostel

836
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
不過還是很開心的，不是嗎？
It was exhilerating though, wasn't it?

837
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
我很生氣有一半是因為你砸了我的手機
Half of my frustration was because you broke my phone

838
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
把你的手機給我，我要和桑亞說一聲
Give me your phone, I need to talk to Soumya

839
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,200
納文，我覺得我們的新辦公室應該在寶威附近
Naveen, I think our new office should be in the vicinity of Powai lake

840
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,900
研究錶明，如果你每天早上看到水，你的血細胞會增加12%
The research says that if you see water every morning, your blood cells are tend to increase by 12%

841
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,300
我們付不起那的房租，混蛋
We can hardly afford 1 BHK there fucker

842
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,000
我們需要網絡運維，傑圖需要程序員，我們需要一個辦公室室，我需要一個實習生
We need someone for UYOS, Jeetu needs a developer, we need an office setup, I need an intern

843
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,000
別擔心，我們的首席執行官班薩爾先生會給我們一切
Don't worry, our CEO Mr. Bansal will give us everything. We'll get everything

844
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
冇有人能得到一切，兄弟
No one ever gets everything dude

845
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,500
有些東西註定不屬於你
There are some things which are never meant to be yours

846
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
你最近到底怎麼了？
What the hell happened to you?

847
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
冇什麼，我開玩笑的
No nothing, I'm just kidding

848
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
好了，你們慢用，我要打個電話
Okay you guys enjoy, I need to make a phone call

849
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,000
納文，你好
Naveen? hi

850
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,500
嘿 拉索爾，你好嗎？
Hey Rathore, how are you bro?

851
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,800
我很好，你呢？
I'm doing great, what about you?

852
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
你現在是大四吧，你在這裏做什麼？
You were in final year, what are you doing here?

853
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,900
不，不，我去年畢業的，我現在在這裏工作
No no, I graduated last year I have a job here now

854
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
太好了，你長大了
That's great. you've grown up

855
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,900
不，夥計，你才是那個成功人士
No dude, you're the one who's doing great

856
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,400
我有關註你的Facebook狀態
I just liked your facebook status

857
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,900
哦，那麼你知道了？
Oh, so you know about it?

858
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
恭喜你，老哥，你成功了
Congratulations man, you aced it

859
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,500
我現在非常嫉妒你
I'm feeling very jealous from you right now

860
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,200
你的未來一定會很精彩
Your life is gonna be awesome dude

861
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,000
而我們隻能在辦公室填寫 excel 錶格
While we will only get to fill excel sheets in our office

862
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,300
隻有周末可以放鬆一下
I've only got weekends to enjoy

863
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
雖然我也想過開一家創業公司，但我冇有足夠的時間
Although I also thought about opening a startup but I couldn't give it enough time

864
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
即使我有足夠的時間，也冇有你的運氣
And even if I got enough time, nobody's luck is as good as yours

865
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,000
回答我一個問題
Tell me one thing...

866
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
你是什麼？
What are you?
