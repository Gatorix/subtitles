1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,670
好啊，那你以什么身份去？
Ok. What defines you better?

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:03,770
麦肯锡的商业顾问还是纳文·班萨尔的女朋友？
Ok. What defines you better?

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,770
麦肯锡的商业顾问还是纳文·班萨尔的女朋友？
Business Consultant at Mckenzie or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,270
拉维 · 拉斯托吉
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

5
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,270
首席执行官、首席技术官、首席营销官
CEO, CTO, CMO

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Superentreprenuer.com 创始人
Founder, Superentreprenuer.com

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,970
这是我的第八家公司
This is my 8th company

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,120
在这之前的那七家呢？
and about those seven before this?

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,020
都倒闭了
They were shut down.

10
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,150
我们现在得和评委谈谈
We have to talk to the judges now

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,220
纳拉扬·穆西来了吗？
Is Narayan Murthy here yet?

12
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,670
活动工作人员现在已经找到了一个新的替代者
So the event staff has seeked a new replacement now

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,850
你怎么能阻止别人参加比赛？
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

14
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:23,920
你们能不能让其他团队签一份说明让他们同意你参赛
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

15
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,900
你们能不能让其他团队签一份说明让他们同意你参赛
Can you just get the other teams to sign on a paper That they're okay with you participating

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
不能去创业公司工作，明白吗？
Don't even think about working in a startup, okay?

17
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,670
你听到了吗？
Do you hear me?

18
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,670
事实上，他没有跟你说实情
Actually, he didn't tell you the whole thing

19
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,950
他想继续创业
He wants to carry on with the startup

20
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,780
好吧，看来我的话在这里没有任何意义
Alright then, it seems like my words have no meaning here

21
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,780
爸爸，给他个机会

22
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,780
爸爸，别走

23
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
你已经尽力了，亲爱的
You tried your best dear

24
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,220
我没有放弃
i didn't give up and run back

25
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
而是选择站在这里
but i choose to stand here to face you guys

26
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,620
拉杰，你告诉我，我不能在台上卖我的产品
Rajat you told me that I cannot sell my product here on stage

27
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,620
所以我卖自己
Therefore I sold myself

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,450
顺便说一嘴，我是普尼特，这是我的名片
by the way i'm Puneet i work for a vc firm, and this is my card

29
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,650
我星期四下午有空，你们星期四有时间吗？
I'm free on thursday afternoon, what are you guys doing on thursday?

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,550
相遇只是开始，共处才有进展，能持续通力合作则是成功

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,800
所以卡鲁内什邀请他的女朋友过来
So, Karunesh invited his girlfriend over

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,400
我跟他说你们睡下层，我睡上层
I told him to use the lower bed frame of the bunk bed and I'll use the upper one

33
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
你俩好好玩
You enjoy your privacy

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,300
他同意了
He agreed

35
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,800
但是莫汉蒂晚上录了他们的小视频
But Mohanti made an MMS clip of them in the night

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
然后把视频转发给了我
And forwarded the clip to me

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
他在早上起来非常生气，开始对我大喊大叫
He became upset in the morning and started yelling at me

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,700
这甚至都不是我的错
It wasn't even my fault

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
听着，拉斯托吉！
Listen Rastogi!

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
你听说过罗纳德 · 韦恩吗？
Have you heard of Ronald Wayne?

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
谁？
Who?

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
罗纳德 · 韦恩，听说过他吗？
Ronald Wayne, ever heard of him?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
他是蝙蝠侠的父亲吗？
Was he Batman's father?

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
他是一个企业家
He was an entrepreneur

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,900
40年前，他和他的两个朋友开了一家公司
40 years ago he started a company with his 2 friends

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
今天，这家公司价值数十亿美元
Today that company is worth billions of dollars

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
但是没有人认识他
But Nobody knows him

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
你知道那家公司的名字吗？
Do you know what is the name of that company?

49
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
什么名字？
What?

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
苹果
Apple

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,900
每个人都知道史蒂夫 · 乔布斯是谁
Everyone knows who Steve Jobs was

52
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
很多人可能也知道史蒂夫 · 沃兹尼亚克
Many people might know about Steve Wozniak too

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
但是没有人记得第三个人的名字
But no one ever remembers the name of the 3rd guy

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
而我是第四个人
And look I'm the 4th guy

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
尤吉说了什么吗？
Yogi said something?

56
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,800
不要因为尤吉说的话而不高兴，他可能是因为脱发而生气
Don't be antsy about what Yogi said, He is probably annoyed with his hairfall

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
他还能说什么呢？
What could he even say?

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,300
总有一天我会痛扁他一顿，他还没看到我粗暴的一面
I'll whoop his sorry ass someday, He hasn't seen my livid side yet

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
但是杰图呢？
But Jeetu?

60
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,400
我上周在电话里告诉他，下个月一号是银行休假日
I told him on the phone last week that its a bank holiday on the 1st of next month

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
接着就是是一个周末
Following with a weekend

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
所以他的薪水可能会晚三四天
So his salary would be 3,4 days overdue

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
他直接就挂电话了
He disconnected the phone halfway

64
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,600
真没礼貌！
How rude!

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,900
你知道我告诉纳文这件事时他说了什么吗？
Do you know what Naveen said when I told him about this?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
我很忙，曼达尔，我晚点再和你谈
I'm busy Mandal I'll talk to you later

67
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,300
去给我泡杯茶
Go make some tea for me

68
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
这是和首席营销官讲话的方式吗？
Is this a way to talk to a CMO?

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
根本不是
Not at all

70
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,000
有时候我觉得自己什么都不是，拉斯托吉
Sometimes it feels like that I'm nothing, Rastogi

71
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
我是说
I mean

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
纳文做了产品展示
Naveen gives presentations

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,900
杰图负责编码
Jeetu does coding

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
尤吉去拉供应商
Yogi gets to meet with vendors

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
没人给我安排正经的事情做
No one gives me any work to do

76
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
我觉得我就和空气一样
I think I'm a zero

77
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
不要为这些愚蠢的小事烦恼
Don't fret over these stupid little things

78
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
看看我，我已经奋斗了14年
Look at me, I've been fighting for 14 years

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,800
而你6个月后就能拿到种子资金了
Look at you, who is gonna bag seed funding in just 6 months

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,700
而且是来自大西洋资本
From none other than Plutus atlantic

81
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,300
现在只剩下合伙人会议了
You're only left with the partner meeting now

82
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,000
到时候每个人都会承认你在市场上的声誉
Then everyone will acknowledge your reputation in the market

83
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
我不需要市场的任何尊重，拉斯托吉
I don't need any respect from the market, Rastogi

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
我只是想让我的三个朋友尊重我
I just want my 3 friends to respect me

85
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
那你就要向他们展示你的奉献精神
Then show them your dedication

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
为你们的事业奉献你的血汗和泪水
Give your blood, sweat and tears to this startup

87
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,800
多做一些事情，他们就会开始尊重你
Go the extra mile and they'll start respecting you

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,900
我还要怎么向他们展示我的奉献精神呢？
How else am I going to show them dedication?

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
我一周五天为杰图鞍前马后
I am the one who works his ass off for Jeetu 5 days a week

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,500
到了晚上我已经筋疲力尽了，但我还是会为尤吉和纳文做晚饭
I get exhausted by the evening but I still cook dinner for Yogi and Naveen

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,000
我整天带着这个U盘走来走去
I go around all day with this pen drive clinging to me

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,000
如果这样奉献的还不够，那我真不知道该怎么做了
If this isn't enough dedication then I don't know what is

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
这个U盘是怎么回事？
What's with this pen drive?

94
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,670
公司所有的秘密
All the company's secrets

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
所有重要的文件
Everything important to the company...

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,900
都在这个U盘里面
...is in this pen drive

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
这个U盘能使我们的公司成为大公司
This is what will make our company big

98
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,300
每次会议后我都会更新
I update it after every meeting

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
我去年在纽约，花了5美元买来的
I was in New York last year, got it from there for $5

100
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
但我确信这个5块钱的U盘有一天会给我们带来50亿美元的收入
But I'm sure that this same device will get us 5 Billion dollars one day

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,900
你怎么不喝这个？
Why don't you drink this? huh?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,100
放轻松
Yeah Chill out!

103
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
不不不不
No no no no

104
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,000
我只喝啤酒.
I will drink only beer...

105
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,300
我喝这种劣质饮料会不舒服
I have a digestion problem with these inferior quality drinks

106
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
喝吧，这没什么不好的
Drink up, there's nothing wrong with it

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
特别推荐
This is Rastogi's special

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
这是我们第六次创业时卖的东西
This is what we were selling in our 6th startup venture

109
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
科伦坡海啸
Colombo Tsunami

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
这个名字起得不好
The title is a little insensitive

111
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
否则老虎环球公司绝对会给我们投钱
Otherwise Tiger Global would've been onboard just like that

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,300
就冲你这句话，我就喝一小口
Just for you, I'll have one sip

113
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,000
好吧，两口
Okay, two

114
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
杰图老婆超性感
Jeetu's wife is so hot man

115
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,500
真的吗？
Really?

116
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
而且很有教养
And so cultured

117
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,900
我不知道我妈在哪里找到这些蠢女人，还坚持要我去见她们
I don't know where my mom finds these dumb bimbos and insists me to meet them

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
我曾经问过一个女孩，“你喜欢《阿凡达》的什么? ”
I once asked a girl, "What do you like about Avatar?"

119
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,000
她说: “拉杰什·坎纳(Avtaar 演员)太可爱了.”
She said, "Rajesh Khanna(*Actor in Avtaar) is so cute"

120
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
这都什么鬼啊？
I mean what the fuck girls?

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
抱歉，我两分钟后回来，憋不住了
Sorry, I'll be back in 2 minutes, Nature's call

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
快点回来
Come back in a jiffy

123
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
你得付账
You have to pay the bill

124
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
当然，我玩得很开心
Of course, I had a good time

125
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
谢谢你！
Thank you!

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
不，不，谢谢你才对
No no, thank you

127
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
如果他们问你期望薪资多少，告诉他们给你点时间考虑一下
If they ask you about the salary, tell them to give you a minute to think

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
告诉hr你自己开车上下班
Tell the HR that you'll manage your own transportation

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,600
他们会非常高兴的
They'll be as pleased as punch

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
伙计们，优步已经接单了，五分钟后到
Guys, Uber is booked Cab will be here in Five

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,600
快点，纳文! 我们要再确认一下
Hurry-up Naveen! We have to double check

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
如果不是因为要升副总，我才不会来
If it weren't for my VP promotion, I wouldn't be fighting for you

133
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
我这么做是因为你们的产品很有前途
I'm doing this because your product is promising

134
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
别抱怨了，我从昨晚就准备好了
Stop yammering, I've been ready since last night

135
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
我系着领带睡觉
I even slept wearing the tie

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
杰图，过来
Jeetu, come along now

137
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
等一下
Hold on a minute

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,500
检查衣柜的抽屉，里面一定有一个白色的手提包
Check in the closet drawer, there must be a white carry bag

139
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,500
是的，有卡利亚尼纱丽的那个
Yes the one with Kalyani sari

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
你能找到你的证件、护照、支票簿和其他文件.
You'll find your certificate, passport, checkbook and every document in it.

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
他在干什么？
What is he up to?

142
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
她老婆今天要面试一份工作
Soumya is interviewing for a job today

143
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,200
他已经絮叨两个小时了
He's been blabbering about his postmodern post-marriage love story for 2 hours

144
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,600
嘿，尤吉
Hey Yogi!

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
你看见我的U盘了吗？
Have you seen my pen drive?

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
哪一个？
Which one?

147
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
跟那个一样的
The same with...

148
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
尤吉已经做了两三个备份了
Yogi has already taken 2 or 3 backups of the presentation

149
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
喂，听着
Oh hello!

150
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
六个备份
Six backups

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
不，不在这里
No its not here

152
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
曼达尔你给我坐下
Mandal, sit your ass down

153
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
曼达尔，坐下
Mandal, sit down there

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,900
纳文你怎么回事？
Naveen, what the hell is going on?

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
纳文，过来！你在这里干什么？
Naveen, come along What are you even doing here?

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,000
我只能睡4个小时，至少让我洗洗脸
I could only sleep for 4 hours, At least let me wash my face

158
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
我们今天终于要拿到资金了
We're finally getting the funding today

159
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,500
我的运气在闪耀，我的脸也应该闪耀，不是吗？
My luck is shining and so should my face, No?

160
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,500
你们这些家伙太小看这次会议了
You guys are taking this meeting very lightly

161
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
这么跟你说吧
I'm telling you since day 1...

162
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,500
就算公司里的每个人都喜欢你的主意，那也跟你能不能拿到钱没关系
...everyone in the firm is liking your idea but this has nothing to do with seed funding

163
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
重要的是巴德瓦伊喜不喜欢
All that matters is whether Bhardwaj likes it or not

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,900
我们只剩下30分钟了，来吧，快过来
We've just 30 minutes left, Come along now come on come on

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
你们就快迟到了
You guys are so tardy...

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,300
把它关掉
...Turn it off

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
好了，我坐下了
Alright I'm sitting down

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
不，不，起来
No no get up

169
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
一定要准时，寺庙可以晚点去
Just be punctual, Temples can wait

170
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
杰图！
Jeetu!

171
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
好吧，我挂了
Alright I'm hanging up

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
听着，早餐在冰箱里，记得吃，好吗？
Hey listen, breakfast is in the fridge Eat properly, Okay?

173
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
哦，还有甜酸奶，它会给你带来好运
Oh and have some sweet yoghurt, it'll bring you good luck

174
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
一切顺利
All the best

175
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
替我祝她好运
Wish her good luck for me

176
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
纳文祝你一切顺利
Naveen wishes you all the best

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,000
也替我祝福她
Wish her for me too

178
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,000
行了，别bb了
Just say it simultaneously and be done with it guys

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,500
不，没什么，普尼特祝你一切顺利.我晚点再打给你
No its nothing, Puneet wishes you all the best. I'll talk to you later

180
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
对不起
Sorry

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
你们知道吗? 理想情况下我根本不该来这里
Do you guys know that Ideally I shouldn't even be here

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
我为什么来这里？
Why did I come here?

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
最重要的是...
The most important...

184
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,900
你们要和谁见面？
With whom are you guys meeting?

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,500
太平洋资本的资深合伙人安吉·巴特瓦吉
Ankit Bhardwaj, senior partner Plutus Atlantic

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
你们知道他是谁吗？
Do you guys have any idea who is he?

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
在风投圈子里，他被称为迈达斯·巴德瓦吉
He's known as Midas Bhardwaj in the VC circles

188
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
是迈迪斯还是迈达斯？
Is it Midas or Midaas?

189
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,000
你闭嘴
Shut up you benighted fool

190
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,000
他的投资组合中有市值1700多万美元的公司，而他的反投资组合中却没有一家
He has 17 multi million dollar companies in his portfolio and zero in his anti portfolio

191
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,000
什么是反投资组合？
What's anti portfolio?

192
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,000
什么是投资者的投资组合？
What is investor's portfolio?

193
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,100
他选择投资的公司都很成功
The companies he chose to fund and they became successful

194
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
那么它的反义词是什么？
Then what is its ANTI?

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,500
那些他选择不投资的公司，却取得了成功
The companies he chose not to fund and yet they became successful

196
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
没错
Exactly

197
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,000
巴德瓦伊在他的个人资料中没有任何反投资组合的标题
Bhardwaj doesn't have any header of anti-portfolio in his profile

198
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
如果他今天拒绝你的提议...
Now if he rejects your idea today...

199
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,000
记住我的话，在孟买或班加罗尔，就不会有人看好你们了
...then mark my words no one will give a flying fuck to your idea in Bombay or Bangalore

200
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,500
那么既然你们不想去德里，我也不想永远做一个分析师
Now you don't want to go to Delhi and I don't want to remain as an analyst forever

201
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
所以让我们一起专注这件事，好吗？
So let's focus on it together, Okay?

202
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
在那个房间里的30分钟...
Those 30 minutes inside that room...

203
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,000
决定你们上天堂还是下地狱
...can take your lives in two completely opposite direction

204
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
你有一个令人印象深刻的产品，你做了很多辛苦的工作
You have an impressive product and you did a lot of elbow grease on it

205
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
就是这样
This is what it boils down to

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
还有进去的时候别忘了先好好舔他
And don't forget to lick his balls the minute you enter there

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
好了，出租车来了我们走吧
Alright guys, cab is here Let's leave

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
纳文，把你的衬衫扣子系好
Naveen, button your shirt to the neck

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
曼达尔，我找不到
Mandal- I couldn't find it

210
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
小朋友们，快点！
Puneet- Guys hurry up!

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
杰图-让我穿上鞋子
Jeetu- Let me put on my shoes

212
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,000
杰图 -曼达尔 你又穿我的袜子了？
Jeetu- Mandal did you wear my socks again?

213
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,000
- 曼达尔 - 不，我穿的是自己的
Mandal- No, I'm wearing my own

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
杰图，你的演示版准备好了吗？
Jeetu, your demo is ready?

215
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
那么Facebook登录呢？
What about FB login?

216
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,500
哦，还没有
Oh, not yet

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
我在出租车上做
I'll do it in the cab

218
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,000
好吧
Yeah okay

219
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
我应该打领带吗？
Should I wear a tie?

220
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
你穿内裤去都行
You can wear boxers in their let alone tie

221
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,970
安基特，纳文和他的团队
Ankit, Naveen and team

222
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,370
你好，我是安基特
hi, i'm Ankit. -Naveen

223
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,770
你们要喝点什么吗？-不用了
you guys want anything？tea？coffee？

224
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
我看了你的演讲，非常发人深省
Sir, I saw your TED Talk it was very thought provoking

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
哪个演讲? 加利福尼亚还是温哥华？
Which one? California or Vancouver?

226
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
两个都看了
Both of them

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
真的吗? 下个月才去温哥华
Really? Vancouver is next month

228
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
普尼特，你要点什么吗？
Puneet, you want anything?

229
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
很抱歉，但是...
I'm sorry guys but...

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
不，不，没关系，你吃你的
No no its okay feel free

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,000
早餐没吃，现在我妻子要我吃燕麦作为惩罚
Missed the breakfast, now my wife is making me eat oats as a punishment

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
你们结婚了吗？
You guys are married?

233
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,200
只有我结婚了，先生
Only me sir

234
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
那你们有女朋友了吗
Oh, so girlfriends?

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
先生，纳文有女朋友
Sir, Naveen has one

236
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
那么安基特，我们要现在开始演示吗？
So Ankit, should we start the presentation?

237
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
纳文
Naveen

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
不，等一下
Uh no wait a second

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
等一下
Hold on for a minute

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
伙计们...
Guys...

241
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
今天我从班加罗尔回来的路上……
...on my way back from bangalore today

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
我必须说这个想法有很大的潜力
And I must say the idea has lot of potential

243
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
你们提到的目标是相当现实并且是实现的
The targets that you guys have mentioned are quite realistic and achievable

244
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
而且收入模式也令人印象深刻
And the revenue model is also very impressive

245
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,500
谢谢，先生
Thank you sir

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
但是...
BUT...

247
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
我要强调但是
And I say the BUT in capital letters

248
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
就在几天前，有几个人给我介绍了...
Couple of days back, few guys presented me...

249
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
想法和目标与你们完全一致
...the exact same idea with the exact same targets

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
并且收入模式也完全一致
and the exact same revenue models

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
我不知道这是怎么回事
Now I'm not sure how this has happened

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,900
等一下，安吉特
Hold on a minute, Ankit

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
我和这些人在一起已经三四个星期了，我非常确信这个想法是他们原创的
I've been with these guys for last 3,4 weeks now I'm pretty convinced that its their original idea...

254
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
我不认为他们会剽窃或者...
I don't think they have stolen it or..

255
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
不，不，我没有指责任何人
No no I'm not accusing anybody

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,900
即使对我来说，这也是一个特殊的情况
Even for me this is a unique situation

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
但是两个团队有着完全相同的想法.
But two teams with exactly the same idea..

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,100
不可能只是巧合
can't just be a coincidence

259
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
但是我们从大学起就有这个想法...
But we have this idea since college...

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
抱歉
sorry,sorry

261
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,000
但是安吉特，我们从大学就开始研究这个了
But Ankit we've been on this since college

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
如果你想看的话，我也可以把我们内部的沟通邮件给你看
If you want I can also show you our chat and conversation over mail

263
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
我们已经计划了3年
We've been planning this for 3 years

264
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,900
老弟，我不是侦探
Guys guys I'm not a detective

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
我是一个投资者
I'm an investor

266
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
同样的产品被两个不同的团队两次推荐给我
And the same product has been pitched to me twice by 2 different teams

267
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,070
先生，你能透露他们的名字吗？
Sir, I mean can you disclose their names?

268
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
好吧.
Well...

269
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,500
现在我不能透露他们的名字
I can't reveal their names at this point of time

270
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
还有...
And...

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
这对你们来说就有了一些改变
This changes few things for you guys

272
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,500
让我来解释一下投资到底是如何运作的
Let me explain you how the investment process really works

273
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
在这片未知的海洋里
So, in this sea of unknown

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,000
你们在这个岛上
You guys are sitting here on this island

275
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,800
带着你们满意的创业想法
Comfortably with your idea

276
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,800
我们把这个岛叫做.
Let's call this island..

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
舒适区
Comfort zone

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
我在这个岛上
And I'm here on this island

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200
神奇的事情发生了
Where magic happens

280
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
这就是大公司形成的地方
This is where big companies are formed

281
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
现在你们必须到这里来
Now you guys have to reach here

282
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
有两种选择
There are 2 options

283
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,900
一.
One..

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
你走出你的舒适区，开始游泳
You step out of your comfort zone and start swimming

285
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,400
你将不得不面对不确定的浪潮
You'll have to face the waves of uncertainty, the tides of sacrifice

286
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
命运无法预测的气候变化
The unpredictable climate change of destiny

287
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,000
还有... 我不确定你能不能撑到那儿
And... I'm not sure if you're gonna make it to there

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
但幸运的是，你们还有另一个选择
But luckily for you guys, there's another option

289
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,500
我有一条船，就叫它小金船吧
I have a boat named as $$ money

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
我可以把这艘船送给你们
I can send this boat to you guys

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
你可以上我的船，很容易就能到达这个岛
You can hop into that boat and can easily make it to this island

292
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
但这就是问题所在
But herein lies the problem

293
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
你们岛屿的复制品就在海的这一端
A replica of your island is at this end of the sea

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
而我只能把我的船只送往一个方向
And I can send my boat in only one direction

295
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,500
但是，先生，既然这是我们最初的想法，我们不应该得到投资吗？
But sir shouldn't we get the investment since its our original idea?

296
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
但是……
But guys..

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
因为这船是我的
Because I own the boat

298
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
只有我能做出这样的选择
Only I can make that choice

299
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,300
虽然听起来很不幸
And as unfortunate as it may sound

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,870
但是现在决定权
The ball right now is..

301
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,700
完全在我的手上
..completely in my court

302
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
我知道这是机密，所以我才打电话给你
I know its confidential, that's why I called you

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
你的晋升要出问题? 那我晚点给你打电话.好的，再见
Your promotion's on stake? I'll call you later then. Okay bye

304
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
伙计们，巴德瓦伊不会透露对方的名字
Guys, thing is that Bhardwaj is not gonna disclose the names

305
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
班加罗尔的团队也不开口
And Bangalore team is also uncommunicative

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
实际上很难知道他们是谁
Realistically its tough to get the names

307
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
普尼特，你能想出办法来吗？
Puneet, can you work something out?

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
我正在努力，但还有一个问题
I'm trying but there's another problem

309
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
巴德瓦伊后天就要去迪拜了
Bhardwaj is leaving for Dubai day after tomorrow

310
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,100
然后呢？
What then?

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
我会在明天的第二次会议上解决这个问题，别担心，我有一些关系
I'll sort it out in a 2nd meeting tomorrow, Don't worry I have some contacts

312
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
我会打电话给他们，然后再打给你
I'll call them and get back to you

313
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
该死！
Shit man

314
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
你确定普尼特没有泄露我们的想法？
Are you sure that Puneet didn't leak our idea?

315
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,300
不，不，他自己的晋升危在旦夕，不是他干的
No no his own promotion is on stake, he didn't do it

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
史瑞雅怎么了? 你知道我今天要开会
What's the matter Shreya? You know I have a meeting today

317
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
那你为什么一遍又一遍地给我打电话？
Then why are you calling me over and over?

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
我遇到了一个大问题，我现在不能来
I'm facing a huge problem here, I can't come right now

319
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,900
但至少告诉我怎么了？
But at least tell me what's the matter?

320
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,950
好的，我来了，好的，我马上到
Alright I'm coming, Yeah I'll be there

321
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,500
伙计们，我20分钟后回来，如果普尼特有什么消息给我打电话
Guys I'll be back in 20, Call me if Puneet comes up with anything

322
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,000
我们应该列一张嫌疑人的名单
We should make a list of probable suspects

323
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,000
那会有帮助吗？
Would that help?

324
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
我有很多反盗窃的经验
I have a lot of experience with larceny

325
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,500
我读 MBA 一年级的时候，有人隔天就会偷我的水桶
When I was in MBA 1st year, someone used to steal my water bucket on alternate days

326
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,000
所以我列了一个表并应用了基本定理，结果发现罪魁祸首是我的舍友
So I formed a list and applied base theorem, Turned out culprit was from my wing

327
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
我有预感是我们认识的人
I have a hunch its somebody we know

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
曼达尔，你的U盘呢？
Mandal, where's your pen drive?

329
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
我不知道，找不到了
I don't know, couldn't find it

330
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
我上周末遇到了拉斯托吉，从那以后...
I met Rastogi last weekend, since then its...

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
操！
FUCK!

332
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
每个演示和模板都在里面
Each and every demo and templates were in it

333
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
现在就打给他
Call that Rastogi now

334
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
快点，你个白痴
Call him you moron

335
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
对不起
I'm sorry

336
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
开免提
Put it on speaker

337
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
他在班加罗尔，他就是在那里偷走我们的想法的
He's in Bangalore, That's where he pitched our idea

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,300
妈的，我们现在一定要去班加罗尔吗？
Shit, do we have to go to Bangalore now?

339
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
想去班加罗尔吗？
Wanna go to Bangalore motherfucker?

340
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,000
是的，拉斯托吉可能正坐在咖啡店里，对着你的名字打飞机
Yeah Rastogi might be sitting in a coffee shop, jerking off to your name

341
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
请不要这样跟我说话
Please don't talk to me like that

342
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,500
我他妈打死你，你个傻逼
I'll beat your ass you cunt face

343
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
你要做的就是什么都不做
All you had to do Mandal was nothing Nothing

344
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
你的工作就是什么都不做，然而你还是搞砸了
That's all you had to do and you shit in that too

345
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
我从第一天开始就跟纳文说我们不能把他算进去
I've been telling Naveen since day 1 that we shouldn't include him

346
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,220
我可以容忍他的零贡献但我不能容忍他挖坑
I can tolerate his zero contribution But I can't put up with his negative contribution

347
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,400
本来我们现在应该拿到投资意向书了
We would've gotten the term sheet by now

348
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
谁给你的权利来搅乱我们的计划？
Who gave you the right to fuck with our lives?

349
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,320
尤吉，你为什么要这么说，兄弟？
Yogi, why are you speaking like that, bro?

350
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,000
我已经很内疚了
I'm already feeling guilty

351
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,850
我不是故意的
I didn't do it on purpose

352
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,000
是，你不是故意的，知道为什么吗？
Yeah you can't do it on purpose, you know why?

353
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
因为你是个混蛋
Because you're a cunt

354
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,400
尤吉，够了，别说了
Yogi its enough Hold on a second

355
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
你是个贱货，全世界都知道你是个贱货，你自己也知道你是个贱货
You're a cunt The whole world knows that you're a cunt And you also know that you are a cunt

356
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,100
别这样跟我说话，尤吉
Stop talking to me like that Yogi

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
是的，我知道我犯了错误.
Yes I know I made a mistake.

358
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,300
但我们是朋友...
But we are friends...

359
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
是吗？
Really?

360
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,200
那么除了我们之外，你的其他朋友呢？
Then where are your other friends besides us?

361
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
你为什么偏偏找拉斯托吉一起喝酒？
And why did you find Rastogi, of all people to drink beer with?

362
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
你知道为什么总是你的水桶被偷吗？
Do you know why it was always your bucket that got stolen?

363
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
因为你就是个贱货
Because you're a pussy

364
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
你是个大傻逼
You're the biggest douchebag out there

365
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
我们所遭受的这种折磨是对你这种贱人加入我们队伍的惩罚
This ordeal that we are suffering is a punishment for involving cunts like you in our team

366
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
那好吧
Okay then

367
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
你不用再为我受苦了
You won't have to suffer because of me again

368
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
和你们合作很愉快
It was great working with you guys

369
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
我不干了
I quit

370
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
曼达尔...
Mandal...

371
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
尤吉，你不应该...
Yogi you shouldn't have...

372
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
- 曼达尔...-赶紧滚
- Mandal... - Get lost

373
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,500
做出明智的决定，永远不要回来，你这该死的输不起的家伙
Take a stand in your life just this once and don't ever come back you damn sore loser

374
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,150
你都干了些什么，尤吉？
What are you doing Yogi?

375
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,300
史瑞亚
Shreya

376
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
等一下等一下
Hold on a minute Just a sec

377
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
阿姨，你能把它移开吗？
Aunty, can you move it?

378
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,000
你叫谁阿姨呢？
Who are you calling aunty?

379
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
大姐，你能把它移开吗？
Madam, can you please move it?

380
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
我们去那边
Come on that side

381
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,070
你这是在闹什么，你从来没有这么不讲道理过
What is this nonsense? you've never been so unreasonable

382
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,600
我正在开会，你一直打电话过来
I was in the middle of a meeting and you kept calling over & over

383
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
还记得里约热内卢吗? 我参加的那个面试？
Remember Rio? That job interview I had?

384
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,000
怎么了? 你不是已经拒绝了.
Yeah, what about that? You rejected it.

385
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,900
是的，但是他们的伦敦办事处有新的空缺
Yes but they have new vacancies in their London office

386
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
他们希望我尽快赶过去
And they want me there ASAP

387
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
事实上，我必须在今晚之前去他们那报到
Infact, I have to get back to them by tonight, latest.

388
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
要去多久？
For how long?

389
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
我以为你在这里很开心？
I thought you were happy here?

390
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,000
我当然很开心，但是...
I am... Ofcourse I am, but...

391
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,900
纳文，这是一个梦幻城市的理想工作
Naveen, its a dream job in a dream city

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
这是一生中只有一次的机会
Its like a once in a lifetime opportunity

393
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
你决定了吗？
Have you decided then?

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
我不知道
I don't know

395
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,670
我真不敢相信我要在...
I can't believe I have to choose between...

396
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
我的未来和我们的未来之间做选择
My future and our future

397
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,300
我不想一个人做出这样的选择
And I don't want to make that choice all by myself

398
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,900
现在我能说什么呢，这是你的决定
What can I say now, its your decision

399
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
如果你是我，你会怎么做？
What would you have done if you were in my place?

400
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
我想你应该去
I think you should go

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
曼达尔手机关机了
Mandal's phone is switched off

402
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
你为什么对他发那么大火，尤吉？
Why do you flip out so much Yogi?

403
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,300
他哪儿也不会去，喝了几杯啤酒就回家了
He's not gonna go anywhere, he'll be home after a couple of beers

404
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,000
尤吉，如果他做了什么蠢事你负的起责任吗？
Yogi, He's Mandal Will you take responsibility if he did anything stupid?

405
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
混蛋回来了
There's your asshole

406
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
一定是桑亚，我让她面试结束后来这里
Must be Soumya, I told her to come here after the interview

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
听着，闭上你的臭嘴，我不想让她被你吓到
Listen, keep your trap shut, I don't want her to get in a stew

408
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,000
我通过了
I got it

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
面试很顺利，他们会给我发offer，下周入职
Interview was amazing, they are gonna send me an offer letter and I'm gonna join by next week

410
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
恭喜你桑亚... 恭喜
Congrats Soumya... Congrats

411
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
对不起，尤吉，我没看见你
I'm sorry Yogi, I didn't see you

412
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
不，不，你们继续，我去里面
No no, you guys carry on I'll be inside

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
不，不，没关系的，这个给你
No no, its allright Actually this is for you

414
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
里面是什么，糖果吗？
What's in it? sweets?

415
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
不，这些是打印店寄来的名片，他们早上送来的
No, these are visiting cards from Vista prints, they delievered it in the morning

416
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
实际上他告诉我以前的卡质量很差，所以...
Actually he told me that the quality of previous cards was quite shoddy so...

417
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
你们会议开得怎么样？
How did the meeting go?

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,500
非常棒，演示相当不错 -演示非常棒的，所以...
It was great, presentation went pretty well Demo was amazing so..

419
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
总之我们做得很好，他很喜欢
We pitched it well, he liked it

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
是的，聊得很愉快
Yeah meeting was great

421
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
你和爸爸谈过了吗？
Did you talk to Dad?

422
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,000
没有
No

423
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,800
其实只有在我爸问到你和你爸的时候才能聊几句
Actually I could talk to my Dad only He was asking about you and dad

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
我有预感爸爸知道这件事
I have a hunch that dad knows about it

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
所以，我想我应该先和你谈谈，然后再和爸爸谈
So, I think first I should talk to you and then dad

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
为什么，你应该先和爸爸谈谈
Why? you should talk to dad first

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
你们是怎么分辨出说的是谁爸爸呢？
How can you married couple can tell the difference between whose dad we're talking about

428
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
好吧，我会跟爸爸说的，但是我应该怎么说？
Okay, I'll talk to dad but should I say?

429
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
说你经常说的话
Say what you always say

430
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,000
我知道我们不同意他的意见，但我们不能不尊重他.你应该给他打电话
I know we disagree with him but we don't disrespect him. You should call him

431
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
普尼特来电话了
Puneet is calling

432
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,400
普尼特，我是尤吉
Yeah, hi Puneet Its Yogi here

433
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,000
喂，听着，尤吉，我不能直接找到名字
Yeah look Yogi, I couldn't find the name directly

434
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,500
但是我这有巴德瓦伊上周的日程安排
But I have Bhardwaj's last week schedule right in front of me

435
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,500
我有他以前所有会面的详细情况
I have the details of all of his previous meetings

436
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
你能查一下他是否和拉斯托吉见过面吗？
Can you check if he had any meeting with Rastogi?

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
查查有没有叫拉斯托吉的
Yeah, check for a Rastogi

438
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
不，不，拉斯托吉有一个 r，是的
No no Rastogi with an R, yes

439
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
没有拉斯托吉
There's no Rastogi here Yogi

440
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
没有拉斯托吉？
No Rastogi?

441
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
你按字母顺序检查一下? 从 a 开始挨个念一遍
Why don't you check alphabetically? and tell me the names starting from A

442
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,400
这里有将近80个名字，我已经交叉核对过了
There are almost 80 names here, I have already cross checked the list

443
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
他们要么是大公司，要么是已经注资的创业公司
Either they are big companies or already funded startups

444
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,000
只剩下一个没有名字的，只有一个电子邮箱
There's only one slot left with no name but just an Email ID

445
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
什么是电子邮箱？
What is the Email ID?

446
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
某种特殊的身份，是的...
Some peculiar ID, yes...

447
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
地下城主@hotmail. com 地下城和主人之间有一个下划线
dungeon_master@hotmail.com there's an underscore between dungeon and master

448
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,370
我操！！！
FUCK!!!!!!!!!!

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
哦，操！
Oh fuck!

450
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,870
你为什么选择这个地方来谈论这么重要的事情
Why did you choose this place to talk about such an important matter

451
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,120
我们本可以去餐厅聊的
We could've gone to a restaurant

452
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
也许是因为我想跟你走一次红毯
Maybe because I wanted to walk down the aisle with you once

453
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,000
很好，你的幽默感还在
Good to know, that your sense of humour is still intact

454
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,000
你的“事业第一”思想仍然保持着我也很欣慰
And good to see, that your "career comes first" ideology is still intact

455
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
纳文！
Naveeeeeen!

456
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
说出来吧
Please say it

457
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,000
只要说一次我爱你，没有你我活不下去，请不要离开我
Just say it once that I love you, I can't live without you, please don't leave me

458
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,000
史瑞雅，我爱你，没有你我活不下去
Shreya, I love you, I can't live without you

459
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
但是请你走吧
But please go

460
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,500
我们会想办法的
We'll try and figure out something

461
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,500
比如什么？
Like what?

462
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
异地恋？
Long distance?

463
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,000
你知道那是行不通的
You know that never works

464
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
我可能再也不会回来了
I might never come back

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,500
你不能搬到那里，我也不能呆在这里
You can't move there and I can't be here

466
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
我们不要把问题简单化，好吗？
Let's not try to take the easy way out, okay?

467
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,000
还有时间，我给你一枚硬币，你去找个审判室做个决定
There's still time. I'll give you a coin, make the trial room your jury room

468
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
这改变不了什么
That is not gonna change anything

469
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,500
我太了解你了，这就是问题所在
I know you too well you know thats the problem

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,500
你知道吗，你变得越来越可预测了
You're getting very predictable you know

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,400
你说不动我的，别说了
You're not instigating me, please stop trying

472
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
听着，真的吗? ，你要放我走? ，我？
Listen, really? You're letting me go? me?

473
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
你要让这个，这个，这个，还有那个走了？
You're letting this and this and these and that go?

474
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,500
你知道得到这个组合有多难吗？
Do you realize how tough it is to get this combination?

475
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
不是难，而是不可能的
It won't be tough, it will be impossible

476
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,300
但这是你的工作，你必须要去
But its your job You have to do it

477
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
你的工作是你死后唯一长久存在的东西
You know that your work is the only thing that will be here long after you're gone

478
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
纳文，那只是一种比喻
Naveen, that's just a figure of speech

479
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,120
我们不是甘地，牛顿或者莎士比亚
We're not Gandhi, Newton or Shakespeare

480
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,920
我们的工作只是一起白头到老，就这么简单
Our work is just gonna get buried with our graves Its as simple as that

481
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,620
不是的，史瑞雅
That is not true Shreya

482
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,570
等一下
Hold on a minute

483
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,000
这是什么？
What is this?

484
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
你的头
Your head

485
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,900
认真点
What nonsense?

486
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,000
告诉我这是什么？
Go on tell me what's this?

487
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,400
这是一个瓶子，怎么了？
Its a bottle, what else?

488
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,000
谁造出来的？
Who built it?

489
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
我怎么知道？
How would I know?

490
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,900
你知道1000年前人类住在山洞里的时候...
You know when man used to live in caves 1000 years ago...

491
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
你在开玩笑吗? ，我们要回到一千年前，是吗？
Are you kidding me? We are going that back, are we?

492
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
是的，听我说
Yeah we are going that back Listen to me

493
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,100
山洞里的人觉得从河里取水很费劲
He would find it arduous to draw water from the rivers

494
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,320
有人就用树叶做了一个装水的容器，但不耐用
Then someone made a water container made of leaves But it wasn't durable

495
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
然后有人注意到，把湿土暴露在阳光直射下会变成粘土
Then someone noticed that exposing wet soil to direct sunlight turns it into clay

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
所以有人用这种粘土做了一个罐子
And then someone else made a pot from that very clay

497
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,000
但这也不是长久之计
But that wasn't durable either

498
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,400
后来有人发明了塑料
Then someone invented plastic

499
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
有人就认为塑料可以做成耐用的容器
And then someone else thought plastic would make a durable container

500
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
然后有人设计了它的形状，另一个人把它变成透明的
Then someone else designed its shape, another person made it transparent

501
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,000
有人设计了盖子，有人设计了拧盖子的线路
Someone discovered the caps, and someone designed the threads of the cap

502
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,000
有人建造了一个制造瓶子的工厂
And someone made a whole factory to manufacture bottles

503
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,000
成千上万的人工作，就为了制造这些瓶子
in which thousands of people work just to make these bottles

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
成千上万的人工作了这么多年，史瑞雅，所以我们今天有瓶子可以用
Millions of people have been working for so many years, Shreya so that we can make use of these bottles

505
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
也许我们不想承认，但是...
Maybe we don't acknowledge it but...

506
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
一代又一代人的工作成果还保留在世上
...there work is still here long after they're gone

507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
这只是一个瓶子，史瑞雅
And this is just a bottle, Shreya

508
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,500
看看你的周围，你正站在人类工作历史的博物馆
look at your surroundings You're standing at a museum of human work history

509
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
看看周围
Just look around

510
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,000
还有什么更好的地方能证明你的观点呢？
And what better place to prove your point, right?

511
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
你总是对的，班萨尔先生
Like always you're right Mr. Bansal

512
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
你会想我吗？
Will you miss me?

513
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,200
也许在某些寂寞的夜晚
On some lonely nights, maybe

514
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
你呢？
You?

515
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
每天晚上都想
Every night

516
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
死鬼
Pervert prick

517
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
好吧，我得做点什么
Well, I'll have to do something

518
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
答应我，在你开始和别人约会之前，给我三个月的时间
Promise me that you'll give me a window of 3 months before you start seeing someone else

519
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,000
好吧，你也不要在伦敦疯狂发自拍
Okay, and you also don't go on a selfie spree once you're in London

520
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
好的
Okay done

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,900
我们是灵魂伴侣，对吧？
We were sort of a soulmates type, right?

522
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,800
如果我在这里，我们肯定会结婚
We would be marrying for sure if I had been here

523
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
感谢上帝，没有让这种事发生
Thank god it didn't happen

524
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,870
所以，严格来说，我们要分手了
So, technically we're breaking up

525
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,770
我们从来没有涉及到技术细节，宝贝
We never got into technicalities baby

526
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,000
不，我这么说是因为...
No, I'm saying that because...

527
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,000
这是分手炮了
...it makes for a breakup sex for one last time

528
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,000
当然
Ofcourse

529
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,000
我今晚要回家一个星期，等我回来再说
I'm leaving for home tonight for one week, We'll get to that once I'm back

530
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,050
不管怎样，我下周就要走了...
Anyway, I'll be leaving next week...

531
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,000
好吧听着
Okay, listen

532
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,900
我想我该走了
I think I should go now

533
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
我晚上还要赶飞机，还没开始收拾行李呢
I have a flight to catch in the evening and I haven't even started packing yet

534
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,000
好吗？
Okay?

535
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
我明天再打电话给你
I'll talk to you tomorrow

536
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
纳文...
Listen...

537
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
拿着这个
Here, keep this

538
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,900
- 这是什么?-密码1767
- What's this? - 1767 (*PIN no.)

539
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
你为什么给我你的信用卡? 别闹？
Why are you giving me your credit card? what nonsense?

540
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
不要在我面前逞英雄，我知道你的经济状况
Don't be a hero in front of me, I know your financial situation

541
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,750
食品杂货我管你一个月，好吗？
Groceries are on me for a month, okay?

542
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
这不是礼物，我是借给你的
And its not a gift, I'm giving you a loan

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,120
你可以以后再付我钱
You can pay me later

544
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
好吗？
Okay?

545
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,400
纳文
Naveen

546
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
纳文，别这样，别在这儿好吗？
Naveen don't do this, not here, okay?

547
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
你知道我不能就这样离开
You know I can't leave like this

548
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
怎么了？
What happened?

549
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,000
为了创业，我不得不做出很多牺牲
I had to do a lot of sacrifices for the startup

550
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,000
我放弃了一份体面的工作，体面的薪水，良好的生活条件
I gave up a decent job, decent salary, good stantard of living

551
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
这些都无所谓
And it never bothered me

552
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
但是现在你为我的工作牺牲了
But now you are sacrificing for my work

553
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
这让我很心疼
It hurts me a lot

554
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
疼得要命
Hurts like hell

555
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
但是如果不疼，那就不算牺牲了，不是吗？
But if didn't hurt then its not gonna be a sacrifice, right?

556
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,900
总有一天你会登上时代杂志的封面
And there'll be a time when you're gonna be on the cover of TIME magazine

557
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
那这一切都值了
then this'll all seem worth it

558
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,000
但是一定要确保这一点，好吗？
But just please make sure that happens, okay?

559
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
为了我们，好吗？
For us, Okay?

560
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
再见，我会打电话给你
Bye, I'll call you

561
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800
我说我最近怎么收到很多生发广告的电子邮件
Thats why I was getting a lot of Emails lately regarding Hair therapy

562
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
他从6个月前就开始整我了
He's been fucking with me since 6 months

563
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
你之前还打算用他来取代我？
And you were gonna replace me with him?

564
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
是的，因为没钱
Yeah because of financial crunch

565
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
你要尝试道歉，尤吉
Learn to apologize, Yogi

566
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
不，道歉太蠢了
Nah, apologies are stupid

567
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,000
但我敢肯定，当我踩在他们屁股上的时候，这些混蛋会道歉的
But I'm sure these assholes will be grovelling when I'll stamp their asses with my shoes

568
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,000
尤吉，拜托，你冷静一下
Yogi please, you ought to be calm

569
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,000
你从早上起就心情不好，让我来处理吧
You're in a black mood since morning, let me handle this with patience

570
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
好吧，但是如果他们激怒我，我他妈搞死他们
Okay but if they aggravated me, I'll fuck their shit up

571
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
他们只有17岁，我要劝劝他们
They are only 17 years old kids, I'll talk some sense into them

572
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
好吧，你先说，说不通我在动手，好吗? ，我们走
Allright, you talk and I'll kick Okay? lets go

573
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,000
他们很幸运，我今天没穿运动鞋
And they're lucky that I didn't put on my woodland shoes today

574
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
这里到底发生了什么？
The fuck happened here?

575
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
上次那些笨蛋在哪里？
Where are those blockheads from last time?

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
- 那是什么?-看起来是屎
What's that? Looks like someone took a shit here

577
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
来吧，快点，我们做正事
Come on hurry up, lets do our business

578
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
来了老弟，我们等你半天了
Come Yogi, come we were waiting for you

579
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
你们知道我们要来吗？
you guys knew we were coming?

580
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
不，不，我们只是喜欢每天晚上8点到10点这样坐着
No no, we just like to sit like this everynight from 8 to 10

581
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,500
我们这里有大门的监控
We got a hold of main gate's CCTV surveilance right here

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,300
宝贝，你的华丽出场可以了，我能走了吗？
Baby, you got your dramatic entry, Can I go now?

583
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
好吧

585
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
班娜丽，我在工作

你知道我们为什么来这里

588
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
我们费了很大力气才创造出那种产品
It took a lot of elbow grease for us to make that product

589
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,000
你们犯了一个错误，这也是违法的
You guys did a mistake and its illegal too

590
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,000
你们只是大学生，我们不会告你的

你只是犯了个错误，没关系.
You made a mistake, its alright.

592

593
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
放松，我们不会对你采取任何行动

If you'll track the IP address, you'll get Mulund's cyber cafe

596
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
你没有任何筹码
You ain't got shit on me

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,500
听着，我们有证据表明这是我们的主意
Look, we have all the proofs which claims that this is our idea

我不怕我的父母

601
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,000
如果我们的父母有足够的时间来管我们...

602
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,000
那你就不会和我这样的小屁孩打交道了
...then you wouldn't be dealing with a brat like me

603
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300

He cajoled a Bulgarian girl on omegle

609

And then every night he used to skype with her, doing some nasty nasty...

610
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,500
但他不知道我录下了所有的视频
But little did he know that I was recording all the chats

611
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
有一天...

我把所有的视频聊天都上传到了网上

It took him a lot of grovelling to do for me to take those videos down

614
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
这可是我最好的朋友
And this is my best friend we're talking about

那么尤吉和斯维特拉娜的文件夹就不仅仅在雷迪的硬盘里了
...then Yogi-Svetlana's folder won't only be in Reddy's hard drive

630
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000

00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
几乎没有任何难度，而且1/4的团队成员已经辞职了
You hardly faced a challenge and 25% percent of the team has resigned already

658
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,300
普尼特，他手机关机了，跟我们有什么关系
Puneet, he has switched off his phone, how is that our fault?

659
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
纳文，跟他讲讲道理
Naveen, talk some sense itno him dude

660
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
我已经不想说话了，你讲吧
I'm tired of talking now, you should do it

661
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
这就是我要支持的团队吗？
Is this the team that I've advocated for?

662
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,900
这位首席执行官参加会议时甚至没有洗澡或梳洗一番
This CEO attends meeting without even taking a shower or freshen up

663
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
这位首席运营官满嘴脏话还欺负人
This CEO curses and bullies people

664
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,300
这个首席技术官疯狂砸电脑
This CTO vandalizes the computers

665
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
看起来是一个百万美元的团队，为什么还没有人投你们呢？
This seems like a million dollar team, howcome no one has decided to fund you yet?

666
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,000
普尼特，他来了
Puneet, he's coming

667
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
好吧，过去的就让它过去吧，只是不要告诉巴德瓦伊
Alright let bygones be bygones, just don't say anything to Bhardwaj

668
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,000
我来说，好吗？
I'll do the talking, okay?

669
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,500
好了，我们走
Okay lets go

670
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,500
你还好吗? ，你看起来很沮丧
Are you alright? you seem gloomy

671
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
嗨，对不起，我被电话拖住了
Hi guys, sorry I got stuck on a call

672
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
你们怎么样？
How're you guys doing?

673
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,900
很好，先生
Good, sir

674
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
曼达尔在哪里...
Where is uhh...

675
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,000
曼达尔身体不适，所以他今天不能参加了
Uhh Manda...uhh Saurabh is unwell actually so he won't be joining us today

676
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
好的，没问题
Okay, no problem

677
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
安基特，我和纳文谈过了，他们真的想重新谈谈条件
Ankit, I was talking to Naveen and these guys really want to renegotiate the terms

678
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,400
普尼特，你能不参加这次会议吗？
Puneet, can you sit this one out?

679
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,300
我真的很抱歉，但我想直接和他们谈谈
I'm really sorry but I want to talk to the guys directly

680
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
所以，如果你能休息一下，那就太好了
So, if you can take a break, it'd be great

681
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
我知道这对你来说意义重大，你为你的产品付出了很多
I know this means a lot to you, you've worked very hard on your product

682
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,000
而且，我真的很感激你们所做的努力
And, I really appreciate the amount of hard work that you've put in

683
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
但是...
But...

684
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
昨晚我和另一队聊了一下然后...
Last night I had a chat with the other team And...

685
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
他们现在给了我一个更好的条件
They are offering me a much better deal now

686
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,200
从现在开始我就可以直接拥有那家公司了
From here on I can virtually own that company

687
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,000
所以... 我没有理由不投资他们
So... I have no reason why I shouldn't invest in them

688
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,700
但是你不认为他们的所作所为是违法的吗？
But don't you think sir its.. what they have done is illegal?

689
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
就像我们的产品已经注册了专利，应该受到专利法保护……
Like we've got our product registered and there are copywrite laws...

690
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,300
你可以复制一个产品，但你不能复制一个想法
You can copywrite a product but you can't copywrite an idea

691
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,900
在网上销售商品是一个想法
Selling goods online is an idea

692
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
但是 Flipkart，Snapdeal，亚马逊，他们都用
But Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon they are all selling it

693
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,300
先生，我认为，这对我们非常不公平
I think sir its extremely unfair to us

694
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,000
- 我们做出的努力...-听着伙计们...
-Like we've been working on this for... -Look guys...

695
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,000
作为一个人，我真的为你感到难过
As a human being, I genuinely feel sorry for you

696
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,500
但作为一个投资者，我不能让这种感觉阻碍我
But as an investor, I can't let that feeling come in my way

697
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,000
如果我想做生意，那么我应该为自己的利益着想，对吗？
And if I want to do a business then I ought to look out for my self interest, right?

698
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,000
普尼特从一开始就知道这件事
Sir like, Puneet knew about it since the beginning

699
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,900
我能进来吗，先生？
May I come in, sir?

700
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
曼达尔？
Saurabh?

701
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
我以为你病了
I thought you were sick

702
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
很抱歉你大老远跑来...
Too bad you came all the way because...

703
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
我只有坏消息要告诉你
I have nothing but bad news for you

704
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
没关系，先生，我可以给您做个演示吗？
Its okay sir, but can I give you a presentation?

705
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,000
演示? 我只是告诉他们我已经下定决心了，没有必要...
Presentation? I just told them that I've made up my mind and there's no point in...

706
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
求你了，先生
Please sir

707
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,000
我花了35000卢比买回来的
I spent Rs 35000 to make this presentation

708
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,300
我知道你已经看过了所有的公司文件，但是先生，这个演示将使我们公司上一个台阶
I know you have seen all the company documents but sir this will make our company really big

709
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
我只需要两分钟，先生
I'll need just 2 minutes sir

710
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
好吧，开始吧
Alright, go ahead

711
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
【纳文的团队】作者: 曼达尔
Naveen's Team by Saurabh Mandal

712
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,700
这个团队由4名成员组成
This team consists of 4 members

713
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,700
纳文·班萨尔
Naveen Bansal

714
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
杰图德拉·马赫什瓦里
Jitendra Maheshwari

715
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
尤吉德拉 · 库马尔 · 潘迪
Yogendra Kumar Pandey

716
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,000
还有我，索拉布 · 曼达尔
And me, Saurabh Mandal

717
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,000
让我们从杰图开始
Let's begin with Jeetu

718
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,300
我们每个人的生活中都有一个知识分子的儿子
All of us have a Mr Sharma's son(*Stereotypical intellectual son) in our life

719
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
但是在比卡内尔的政府高中，有一位马赫什瓦里先生的儿子
But in Bikaner's Government high school, there was a Mr Maheshwari's son

720
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
杰图德拉·马赫什瓦里
Jitendra Maheshwari

721
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,000
先生，我从来没有看过后街男孩的现场表演
Sir, I've never seen a live performance of Backstreet Boys

722
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
但是我看到过杰图写代码
But I've seen Jeetu writing code

723
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
连续36小时不睡觉
Continuously for 36 hours, without any sleep

724
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,900
他本可以去美国为 facebook 工作
He could've easily gone to US to work for facebook

725
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
但他为了家庭没有离开印度
But he didn't leave India for his family's sake

726
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,000
毕竟他是个顾家的人
Afterall he is a family man

727
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,000
现在，这是他有生以来第一次为了这家创业公司与家人作对
And now for the first time in his life he went against his family for this startup

728
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
为什么? 他为什么这么做？
Why? Why did he do it?

729
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,000
尤吉
Yogi

730
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,300
先生，有些人认识的人很少
Sir, some people know very few people

731
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,600
有些人认识的人很多
Some people know most of the people

732
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,700
但是尤吉认识所有人
But Yogi knows everyone

733
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
纳文告诉我，当他们访问古吉拉特时，尤吉安排在凌晨4点喝啤酒
Naveen told me that when they visited Gujarat(*Dry state) Yogi arranged for a beer at 4 in the morning

734
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,000
我从尤吉那里学到了很多关于削减成本的知识，而不是在MBA课程学来的
I learned more about Cost cutting from Yogi than from my MBA lectures

735
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,100
他买了一块二十五里拉的蛋糕作为生日礼物
He bought a cake of just Rs. 25 for his birthday

736
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,000
他的平均 gpa 只有5.3(满分10分)
He had a CGPA of just 5.3(out of 10)

737
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,000
但是他年薪220万卢比
But he got a salary package of Rs 2.2 million

738
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,500
如果他在那里工作的话，两年内他就会成为孟买的地区负责人
He would've been the Mumbai regional head in just 2 years had he been working there

739
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
但是他为什么要离开他的工作去创业呢？ 为什么他要竭尽全力这个创业公司奋斗？
But then why did he leave his job for this startup? Why is he fighting tooth and nail for this startup?

740
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
难道是为了加快脱发？
Only to let his hair fall?

741
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,000
为什么？
Why?

742
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
最后
And finally

743
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
纳文·班萨尔
Naveen Bansal

744
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,000
我喜欢看电影
I love watching movies

745
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,900
每部电影的结尾都有"由xx指导"的一行字
In the end of every movie, there's director's name written under "A film by"

746
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,400
我过去常常因为看到这个而生气
I used to get angry by seeing that

747
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,400
我是说...
I mean...

748
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,000
演员表演，编剧写剧本，摄影师拍摄
Actor acts, writer writes and cinematographer shoots the film

749
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,000
那么导演做了什么使他得到如此特别的关注呢
Then what does the director do that he gets such a special attention

750
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
他所要做的就是做选择，好还是坏
All he has to do is to make a choice Good or bad

751
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,000
但是纳文意识到，选择是生活中最具挑战性的事情
But Naveen has realised me that choices are the most challenging things in life

752
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,400
先生，这整件事都是纳文的主意
Sir, this whole idea is Naveen's

753
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,000
这是他的产品
This is his product

754
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,000
这是他的团队
This is his team

755
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,000
我们都可以为他挡子弹
If there's anyone in this world for whom we all can take a bullet

756
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,000
这就是坐在这里的那位先生
This is the gentleman sitting over here

757
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
为了这个团队，他把我们的家庭办公室和他自己的家变成了一个仓库
For this team, he made our home office and his own home was turned itno a warehouse

758
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,500
这就是那个不喜欢自己熨衬衫的人，他现在自愿帮我们洗所有的衣服
This is the man who didn't like to iron his own shirts, who now volunteers to launder all of our clothes

759
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,600
我们所有人都为彼此做出了很多牺牲
All of us have done a lot of sacrifices for each other

760
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
但是纳文为了保护我们所做的远不止这些
But Naveen has done a lot more than that to shield us

761
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,900
为什么纳文要这么做？
Why is Naveen doing all this?

762
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
我们为什么要这么做？
All of us

763
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,000
为什么我们所有人都对这家创业公司如此执着？
Why all of us are so hell-bent for this startup?

764
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
我来告诉你为什么，先生
I'll tell you why sir

765
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,400
因为我们都想到达这里
Because we all want to reach here

766
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,900
我们不会等任何船
And we're not waiting for any boat

767
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
我们已经在未知的海洋中漂流
We're already swimming in the sea of unknown

768
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
我们早就离开了我们的舒适区
We've already left our comfort zone long ago

769
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,600
现在我们不关心我们将要面对的变化、挑战或牺牲
Now we don't care about the changes, challenges or sacrifices we'll have to face

770
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,400
无论如何
No matter what

771
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
我们的队伍会到达这里，奇迹发生的地方
Our team will reach here, where magic happens

772
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
你在你的团队里是做什么的？
And what do you do in your team?

773
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
先生，我个人没有任何价值
Sir, I don't have any value individually

774
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
我是空气
I'm a zero

775
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
但是我的加入使公司净值增加了10倍
But the net value increases by 10 times when I add up

776
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
你已经说得很清楚了
You've made your point

777
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,000
现在让我把我的观点再强调一下
Now let me make my point very clear

778
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
不管哪支队伍来到这里
No matter which team gets here

779
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,900
最终我将塑造他们的想法，让他们成为一个更大的公司
It's ultimately going to be me who's going to shape their idea and make them a bigger company

780
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
这需要业务专业知识来构建这些东西
You need business business expertise to build this things

781
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
听起来可能很傲慢，但让我告诉你们
And, at the risk of sounding arrogant let me tell you guys that

782
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
我选择的团队一定是最强的
The team which I shall support, that team would be the strongest

783
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,500
这个团队必将成为一个更大的公司
And that team will make a bigger company

784
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
我想你们忘了，我已经决定投资另一队了
And I think you guys are forgetting that, I've already decided to back the other team

785
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,500
先生，你还忘了一件事
Sir, you're also forgetting something

786
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
你的岛不是海里唯一的岛屿
Yours is not the only island in the sea

787
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,000
还有其他神奇的岛屿
There are other magical islands

788
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,500
他们也很愿意拉我们上岸
Who'll be more than happy to have us on the shore

789
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
所以你是说...
So you're saying that...

790
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
还有其他投资者有投资意向？
You've offers from other investors as well?

791
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,500
先生，你真的认为我们只向一个投资者展示产品吗？
Sir, do you really think that we presented our product to just one investor?

792
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
这些投资者到底是谁？
And who are these investors exactly?

793
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
对不起，先生，我现在不能透露他们的名字
Sorry sir, I can't reveal their names at this point of time

794
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,000
你们知道我的名声
You know my reputation guys

795
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,000
如果我拒绝你的想法，那么没有人敢在这里给你们投资
If I reject your idea, then no one will dare to invest here with you

796
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,500
先生，你知道我们的毅力
And sir you know our perseverance

797
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,700
我们一定会上岸的
We'll surely make it up to there

798
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,000
无论是在你的投资组合中还是在你的反投资组合中
Either in your portfolio or in your anti-portfolio

799
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,450
我经常玩扑克
I play poker a lot

800
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
我一看就知道你是在虚张声势
I know a bluff when I see one

801
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
你没有别的选择
You have no other offers

802
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,500
你在利用我害怕失败的心理
You're trying to play on my fear of losing out

803
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,500
事实就是...
When the fact is...

804
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
除了我
Apart from me

805
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,000
你无处可去
You've nowhere else to go

806
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
好吧，被你识破了
Sir, the ball is still in your court

807
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,200
呆在这儿，曼达尔，你要去哪儿？
Stay here Mandal, where are you going?

808
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,000
不，我要回家
No, I'm going home

809
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,000
我得起草一份正式的辞职信
I have to draft a formal resignation letter

810
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,500
你的“毅力”和“上岸”哪去了？
Whatever happened to your "perseverance" and "making up to the island"?

811
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,500
我们要你留下你还非要走
Now that we're telling you to stay, you're walking out

812
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
不，过多的情感依恋是不好的
No, too much emotional attachment is bad

813
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,500
无论发生了什么，都是最好的结果
Whatever happened, happened for the best

814
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,900
坐下，混蛋
Sit-down asshole

815
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
你没听见我说话吗，混蛋，回来
Didn't you hear me asshole? come back

816
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,500
如果我是个混蛋，你为什么还要我留下？
Why do you want me to stay if I'm an asshole?

817
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,000
因为你是我的朋友，混蛋
Because you're my friend motherfucker

818
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,900
过来，坐下
Come on now, sit-down here

819
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,900
我不会的
I won't

820
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
那只是一个演示，现在不要想逞英雄
It was just a presentation, don't try to be a hero now

821
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,900
我昨天心情不好，回来吧
I was in a black mood yesterday, come on back here

822
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
我说了我不会
I said I won't

823
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,500
我知道我昨天反应过度了，试着理解我在说什么
I know I overreacted yesterday, try to understand what I'm saying

824
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
理解什么？
understand what?

825
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,000
我说对不起，混蛋
That I'm saying sorry motherfucker

826
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
现在给我回来，不然我揍你
Now come back here or I'll whoop your ass

827
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
没关系，我原谅你
It's okay I forgive you

828
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
我们拿到了
We got it

829
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
我们成功了，杰图
We go it Jeetu

830
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
我要倒了
Guys put me down

831
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
我告诉过你我的U盘能做什么
I told you what my pen drive could do

832
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,000
干杯
Cheers

833
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,900
哥几个，今晚不醉不归
Let's take about 10 such pitchers to home, we'll get some fine quality beer with a lot of froth

834
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,600
我们只有10% 的种子基金，别在文书工作之前搞砸了
We've only got 10% of the seed fund, don't fuck this up before paperwork

835
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,000
这话出自一个最近在青年旅社砸电脑的家伙之口
Says the guy who recently fucked it up in a hostel

836
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
不过还是很开心的，不是吗？
It was exhilerating though, wasn't it?

837
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
我很生气有一半是因为你砸了我的手机
Half of my frustration was because you broke my phone

838
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
把你的手机给我，我要和桑亚说一声
Give me your phone, I need to talk to Soumya

839
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,200
纳文，我觉得我们的新办公室应该在宝威附近
Naveen, I think our new office should be in the vicinity of Powai lake

840
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,900
研究表明，如果你每天早上看到水，你的血细胞会增加12%
The research says that if you see water every morning, your blood cells are tend to increase by 12%

841
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,300
我们付不起那的房租，混蛋
We can hardly afford 1 BHK there fucker

842
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,000
我们需要网络运维，杰图需要程序员，我们需要一个办公室室，我需要一个实习生
We need someone for UYOS, Jeetu needs a developer, we need an office setup, I need an intern

843
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,000
别担心，我们的首席执行官班萨尔先生会给我们一切
Don't worry, our CEO Mr. Bansal will give us everything. We'll get everything

844
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
没有人能得到一切，兄弟
No one ever gets everything dude

845
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,500
有些东西注定不属于你
There are some things which are never meant to be yours

846
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
你最近到底怎么了？
What the hell happened to you?

847
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
没什么，我开玩笑的
No nothing, I'm just kidding

848
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
好了，你们慢用，我要打个电话
Okay you guys enjoy, I need to make a phone call

849
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,000
纳文，你好
Naveen? hi

850
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,500
嘿 拉索尔，你好吗？
Hey Rathore, how are you bro?

851
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,800
我很好，你呢？
I'm doing great, what about you?

852
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
你现在是大四吧，你在这里做什么？
You were in final year, what are you doing here?

853
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,900
不，不，我去年毕业的，我现在在这里工作
No no, I graduated last year I have a job here now

854
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
太好了，你长大了
That's great. you've grown up

855
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,900
不，伙计，你才是那个成功人士
No dude, you're the one who's doing great

856
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,400
我有关注你的Facebook状态
I just liked your facebook status

857
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,900
哦，那么你知道了？
Oh, so you know about it?

858
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
恭喜你，老哥，你成功了
Congratulations man, you aced it

859
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,500
我现在非常嫉妒你
I'm feeling very jealous from you right now

860
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,200
你的未来一定会很精彩
Your life is gonna be awesome dude

861
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,000
而我们只能在办公室填写 excel 表格
While we will only get to fill excel sheets in our office

862
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,300
只有周末可以放松一下
I've only got weekends to enjoy

863
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
虽然我也想过开一家创业公司，但我没有足够的时间
Although I also thought about opening a startup but I couldn't give it enough time

864
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
即使我有足够的时间，也没有你的运气
And even if I got enough time, nobody's luck is as good as yours

865
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,000
回答我一个问题
Tell me one thing...

866
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
你是什么？
What are you?
