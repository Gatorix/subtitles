1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,770
Ok. What defines you better?

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,770
Business Consultant at Mckenzie or Naveen Bansal's girlfirend?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,270
Ravi Ram Rastogi.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,270
CEO, CTO, CMO

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Founder, Superentreprenuer.com

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,970
This is my 8th company

7
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,120
and about those seven before this?

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,020
They were shut down.

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,150
We have to talk to the judges now

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,220
Is Narayan Murthy here yet?

11
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,670
So the event staff has seeked a new replacement now

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,900
Can you just get the other teams to sign on a paper That they're okay with you participating

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,900
Don't even think about working in a startup, okay?

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,670
Do you hear me?

16
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,670
Actually, he didn't tell you the whole thing

17
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,950
He wants to carry on with the startup

18
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,780
Alright then, it seems like my words have no meaning here

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
You tried your best dear

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,220
i didn't give up and run back

21
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
but i choose to stand here to face you guys

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,620
Rajat you told me that I cannot sell my product here on stage

23
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,620
Therefore I sold myself

24
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,450
by the way i'm Puneet i work for a vc firm, and this is my card

25
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,650
I'm free on thursday afternoon, what are you guys doing on thursday?

26
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,800
So, Karunesh invited his girlfriend over

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,400
I told him to use the lower bed frame of the bunk bed and I'll use the upper one

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
You enjoy your privacy

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,300
He agreed

30
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,800
But Mohanti made an MMS clip of them in the night

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
And forwarded the clip to me

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,800
He became upset in the morning and started yelling at me

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,700
It wasn't even my fault

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
Listen Rastogi!

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,000
Have you heard of Ronald Wayne?

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,500
Who?

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Ronald Wayne, ever heard of him?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Was he Batman's father?

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He was an entrepreneur

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,900
40 years ago he started a company with his 2 friends

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Today that company is worth billions of dollars

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,700
But Nobody knows him

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Do you know what is the name of that company?

44
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Apple

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,900
Everyone knows who Steve Jobs was

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Many people might know about Steve Wozniak too

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But no one ever remembers the name of the 3rd guy

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And look I'm the 4th guy

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,000
Yogi said something?

51
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't be antsy about what Yogi said, He is probably annoyed with his hairfall

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What could he even say?

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,300
I'll whoop his sorry ass someday, He hasn't seen my livid side yet

54
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
But Jeetu?

55
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,400
I told him on the phone last week that its a bank holiday on the 1st of next month

56
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,100
Following with a weekend

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
So his salary would be 3,4 days overdue

58
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,400
He disconnected the phone halfway

59
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,600
How rude!

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,900
Do you know what Naveen said when I told him about this?

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm busy Mandal I'll talk to you later

62
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,300
Go make some tea for me

63
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,600
Is this a way to talk to a CMO?

64
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,300
Not at all

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,000
Sometimes it feels like that I'm nothing, Rastogi

66
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
I mean

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
Naveen gives presentations

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,900
Jeetu does coding

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yogi gets to meet with vendors

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
No one gives me any work to do

71
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
I think I'm a zero

72
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't fret over these stupid little things

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,000
Look at me, I've been fighting for 14 years

74
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,800
Look at you, who is gonna bag seed funding in just 6 months

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,700
From none other than Plutus atlantic

76
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,300
You're only left with the partner meeting now

77
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Then everyone will acknowledge your reputation in the market

78
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't need any respect from the market, Rastogi

79
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
I just want my 3 friends to respect me

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Then show them your dedication

81
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Give your blood, sweat and tears to this startup

82
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,800
Go the extra mile and they'll start respecting you

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,900
How else am I going to show them dedication?

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
I am the one who works his ass off for Jeetu 5 days a week

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,500
I get exhausted by the evening but I still cook dinner for Yogi and Naveen

86
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,000
I go around all day with this pen drive clinging to me

87
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,000
If this isn't enough dedication then I don't know what is

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's with this pen drive?

89
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,670
All the company's secrets

90
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,500
Everything important to the company...

91
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,900
...is in this pen drive

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
This is what will make our company big

93
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,300
I update it after every meeting

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I was in New York last year, got it from there for $5

95
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,000
But I'm sure that this same device will get us 5 Billion dollars one day

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,900
Why don't you drink this? huh?

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,100
Yeah Chill out!

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
No no no no

99
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,000
I will drink only beer...

100
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,300
I have a digestion problem with these inferior quality drinks

101
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Drink up, there's nothing wrong with it

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
This is Rastogi's special

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is what we were selling in our 6th startup venture

104
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,000
Colombo Tsunami

105
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
The title is a little insensitive

106
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Otherwise Tiger Global would've been onboard just like that

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,300
Just for you, I'll have one sip

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, two

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
Jeetu's wife is so hot man

110
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,500
Really?

111
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,200
And so cultured

112
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,900
I don't know where my mom finds these dumb bimbos and insists me to meet them

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I once asked a girl, "What do you like about Avatar?"

114
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,000
She said, "Rajesh Khanna(*Actor in Avtaar) is so cute"

115
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean what the fuck girls?

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sorry, I'll be back in 2 minutes, Nature's call

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come back in a jiffy

118
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
You have to pay the bill

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course, I had a good time

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you!

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,000
No no, thank you

122
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,500
If they ask you about the salary, tell them to give you a minute to think

123
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Tell the HR that you'll manage your own transportation

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,600
They'll be as pleased as punch

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Guys, Uber is booked Cab will be here in Five

126
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,600
Hurry-up Naveen! We have to double check

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If it weren't for my VP promotion, I wouldn't be fighting for you

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm doing this because your product is promising

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Stop yammering, I've been ready since last night

130
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
I even slept wearing the tie

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
Jeetu, come along now

132
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
Hold on a minute

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,500
Check in the closet drawer, there must be a white carry bag

134
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,500
Yes the one with Kalyani sari

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
You'll find your certificate, passport, checkbook and every document in it.

136
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
What is he up to?

137
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,800
Soumya is interviewing for a job today

138
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,200
He's been blabbering about his postmodern post-marriage love story for 2 hours

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,600
Hey Yogi!

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Have you seen my pen drive?

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Which one?

142
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,000
The same with...

143
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Yogi has already taken 2 or 3 backups of the presentation

144
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,300
Oh hello!

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
Six backups

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No its not here

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Mandal, sit your ass down

148
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,200
Mandal, sit down there

149
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you doing?

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,900
Naveen, what the hell is going on?

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Naveen, come along What are you even doing here?

152
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,000
I could only sleep for 4 hours, At least let me wash my face

153
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
We're finally getting the funding today

154
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,500
My luck is shining and so should my face, No?

155
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,500
You guys are taking this meeting very lightly

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm telling you since day 1...

157
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,500
...everyone in the firm is liking your idea but this has nothing to do with seed funding

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
All that matters is whether Bhardwaj likes it or not

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,900
We've just 30 minutes left, Come along now come on come on

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
You guys are so tardy...

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,300
...Turn it off

162
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,900
Alright I'm sitting down

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
No no get up

164
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
Just be punctual, Temples can wait

165
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
Jeetu!

166
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,900
Alright I'm hanging up

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hey listen, breakfast is in the fridge Eat properly, Okay?

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh and have some sweet yoghurt, it'll bring you good luck

169
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,000
All the best

170
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
Wish her good luck for me

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,000
Naveen wishes you all the best

172
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,000
Wish her for me too

173
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,000
Just say it simultaneously and be done with it guys

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,500
No its nothing, Puneet wishes you all the best. I'll talk to you later

175
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Sorry

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,500
Do you guys know that Ideally I shouldn't even be here

177
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,900
Why did I come here?

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The most important...

179
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,900
With whom are you guys meeting?

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Ankit Bhardwaj, senior partner Plutus Atlantic

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,900
Do you guys have any idea who is he?

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
He's known as Midas Bhardwaj in the VC circles

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
Is it Midas or Midaas?

184
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,000
Shut up you benighted fool

185
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,000
He has 17 multi million dollar companies in his portfolio and zero in his anti portfolio

186
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,000
What's anti portfolio?

187
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,000
What is investor's portfolio?

188
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,100
The companies he chose to fund and they became successful

189
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Then what is its ANTI?

190
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,500
The companies he chose not to fund and yet they became successful

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Exactly

192
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,000
Bhardwaj doesn't have any header of anti-portfolio in his profile

193
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,800
Now if he rejects your idea today...

194
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,000
...then mark my words no one will give a flying fuck to your idea in Bombay or Bangalore

195
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,500
Now you don't want to go to Delhi and I don't want to remain as an analyst forever

196
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,600
So let's focus on it together, Okay?

197
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,000
Those 30 minutes inside that room...

198
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,000
...can take your lives in two completely opposite direction

199
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
You have an impressive product and you did a lot of elbow grease on it

200
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
This is what it boils down to

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,400
And don't forget to lick his balls the minute you enter there

202
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Alright guys, cab is here Let's leave

203
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,300
Naveen, button your shirt to the neck

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Mandal- I couldn't find it

205
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
Puneet- Guys hurry up!

206
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Jeetu- Let me put on my shoes

207
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,000
Jeetu- Mandal did you wear my socks again?

208
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,000
Mandal- No, I'm wearing my own

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Jeetu, your demo is ready?

210
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
What about FB login?

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,500
Oh, not yet

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll do it in the cab

213
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah okay

214
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Should I wear a tie?

215
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,000
You can wear boxers in their let alone tie

216
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,970
Ankit, Naveen and team

217
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,370
hi, i'm Ankit. -Naveen

218
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,770
you guys want anything？tea？coffee？

219
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
Sir, I saw your TED Talk it was very thought provoking

220
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,100
Which one? California or Vancouver?

221
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Both of them

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Really? Vancouver is next month

223
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Puneet, you want anything?

224
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry guys but...

225
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
No no its okay feel free

226
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Missed the breakfast, now my wife is making me eat oats as a punishment

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You guys are married?

228
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,200
Only me sir

229
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Oh, so girlfriends?

230
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Sir, Naveen has one

231
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
So Ankit, should we start the presentation?

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,900
Naveen

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,900
Uh no wait a second

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Hold on for a minute

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Guys...

236
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
...on my way back from bangalore today

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I must say the idea has lot of potential

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,200
The targets that you guys have mentioned are quite realistic and achievable

239
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,000
And the revenue model is also very impressive

240
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,500
Thank you sir

241
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
BUT...

242
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,000
And I say the BUT in capital letters

243
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,500
Couple of days back, few guys presented me...

244
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,900
...the exact same idea with the exact same targets

245
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and the exact same revenue models

246
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Now I'm not sure how this has happened

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,900
Hold on a minute, Ankit

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've been with these guys for last 3,4 weeks now I'm pretty convinced that its their original idea...

249
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't think they have stolen it or..

250
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,500
No no I'm not accusing anybody

251
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,900
Even for me this is a unique situation

252
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But two teams with exactly the same idea..

253
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,100
can't just be a coincidence

254
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
But we have this idea since college...

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
sorry,sorry

256
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,000
But Ankit we've been on this since college

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you want I can also show you our chat and conversation over mail

258
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
We've been planning this for 3 years

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,900
Guys guys I'm not a detective

260
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm an investor

261
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,000
And the same product has been pitched to me twice by 2 different teams

262
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,070
Sir, I mean can you disclose their names?

263
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Well...

264
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,500
I can't reveal their names at this point of time

265
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
And...

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
This changes few things for you guys

267
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,500
Let me explain you how the investment process really works

268
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So, in this sea of unknown

269
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,000
You guys are sitting here on this island

270
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,800
Comfortably with your idea

271
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,800
Let's call this island..

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,500
Comfort zone

273
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I'm here on this island

274
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Where magic happens

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is where big companies are formed

276
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,400
Now you guys have to reach here

277
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
There are 2 options

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,900
One..

279
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You step out of your comfort zone and start swimming

280
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,400
You'll have to face the waves of uncertainty, the tides of sacrifice

281
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
The unpredictable climate change of destiny

282
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,000
And... I'm not sure if you're gonna make it to there

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But luckily for you guys, there's another option

284
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,500
I have a boat named as $$ money

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
I can send this boat to you guys

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can hop into that boat and can easily make it to this island

287
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
But herein lies the problem

288
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,300
A replica of your island is at this end of the sea

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And I can send my boat in only one direction

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,500
But sir shouldn't we get the investment since its our original idea?

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
But guys..

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,500
Because I own the boat

293
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Only I can make that choice

294
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,300
And as unfortunate as it may sound

295
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,870
The ball right now is..

296
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,700
..completely in my court

297
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I know its confidential, that's why I called you

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Your promotion's on stake? I'll call you later then. Okay bye

299
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,500
Guys, thing is that Bhardwaj is not gonna disclose the names

300
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
And Bangalore team is also uncommunicative

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,400
Realistically its tough to get the names

302
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Puneet, can you work something out?

303
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm trying but there's another problem

304
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,500
Bhardwaj is leaving for Dubai day after tomorrow

305
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,100
What then?

306
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
I'll sort it out in a 2nd meeting tomorrow, Don't worry I have some contacts

307
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll call them and get back to you

308
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Shit man

309
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Are you sure that Puneet didn't leak our idea?

310
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,300
No no his own promotion is on stake, he didn't do it

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What's the matter Shreya? You know I have a meeting today

312
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,800
Then why are you calling me over and over?

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm facing a huge problem here, I can't come right now

314
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,900
But at least tell me what's the matter?

315
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,950
Alright I'm coming, Yeah I'll be there

316
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,500
Guys I'll be back in 20, Call me if Puneet comes up with anything

317
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,000
We should make a list of probable suspects

318
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,000
Would that help?

319
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I have a lot of experience with larceny

320
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,500
When I was in MBA 1st year, someone used to steal my water bucket on alternate days

321
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,000
So I formed a list and applied base theorem, Turned out culprit was from my wing

322
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
I have a hunch its somebody we know

323
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mandal, where's your pen drive?

324
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know, couldn't find it

325
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I met Rastogi last weekend, since then its...

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
FUCK!

327
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
Each and every demo and templates were in it

328
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Call that Rastogi now

329
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
Call him you moron

330
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm sorry

331
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Put it on speaker

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
He's in Bangalore, That's where he pitched our idea

333
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,300
Shit, do we have to go to Bangalore now?

334
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
Wanna go to Bangalore motherfucker?

335
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah Rastogi might be sitting in a coffee shop, jerking off to your name

336
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,200
Please don't talk to me like that

337
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,500
I'll beat your ass you cunt face

338
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
All you had to do Mandal was nothing Nothing

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,500
That's all you had to do and you shit in that too

340
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
I've been telling Naveen since day 1 that we shouldn't include him

341
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,220
I can tolerate his zero contribution But I can't put up with his negative contribution

342
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,400
We would've gotten the term sheet by now

343
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,000
Who gave you the right to fuck with our lives?

344
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,320
Yogi, why are you speaking like that, bro?

345
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm already feeling guilty

346
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,850
I didn't do it on purpose

347
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah you can't do it on purpose, you know why?

348
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
Because you're a cunt

349
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,400
Yogi its enough Hold on a second

350
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,500
You're a cunt The whole world knows that you're a cunt And you also know that you are a cunt

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,100
Stop talking to me like that Yogi

352
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,800
Yes I know I made a mistake.

353
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,300
But we are friends...

354
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Really?

355
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,200
Then where are your other friends besides us?

356
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,000
And why did you find Rastogi, of all people to drink beer with?

357
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you know why it was always your bucket that got stolen?

358
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,500
Because you're a pussy

359
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
You're the biggest douchebag out there

360
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This ordeal that we are suffering is a punishment for involving cunts like you in our team

361
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
Okay then

362
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You won't have to suffer because of me again

363
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,000
It was great working with you guys

364
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
I quit

365
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
Mandal...

366
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Yogi you shouldn't have...

367
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,500
- Mandal... - Get lost

368
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,500
Take a stand in your life just this once and don't ever come back you damn sore loser

369
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,150
What are you doing Yogi?

370
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,300
Shreya

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hold on a minute Just a sec

372
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
Aunty, can you move it?

373
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,000
Who are you calling aunty?

374
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Madam, can you please move it?

375
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Come on that side

376
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,070
What is this nonsense? you've never been so unreasonable

377
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,600
I was in the middle of a meeting and you kept calling over & over

378
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
Remember Rio? That job interview I had?

379
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, what about that? You rejected it.

380
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,900
Yes but they have new vacancies in their London office

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
And they want me there ASAP

382
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
Infact, I have to get back to them by tonight, latest.

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
For how long?

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I thought you were happy here?

385
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,000
I am... Ofcourse I am, but...

386
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,900
Naveen, its a dream job in a dream city

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Its like a once in a lifetime opportunity

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Have you decided then?

389
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know

390
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,670
I can't believe I have to choose between...

391
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,800
My future and our future

392
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,300
And I don't want to make that choice all by myself

393
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,900
What can I say now, its your decision

394
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
What would you have done if you were in my place?

395
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,400
I think you should go

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Mandal's phone is switched off

397
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Why do you flip out so much Yogi?

398
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,300
He's not gonna go anywhere, he'll be home after a couple of beers

399
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Yogi, He's Mandal Will you take responsibility if he did anything stupid?

400
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
There's your asshole

401
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,000
Must be Soumya, I told her to come here after the interview

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Listen, keep your trap shut, I don't want her to get in a stew

403
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,000
I got it

404
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Interview was amazing, they are gonna send me an offer letter and I'm gonna join by next week

405
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,000
Congrats Soumya... Congrats

406
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry Yogi, I didn't see you

407
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
No no, you guys carry on I'll be inside

408
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No no, its allright Actually this is for you

409
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
What's in it? sweets?

410
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
No, these are visiting cards from Vista prints, they delievered it in the morning

411
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,500
Actually he told me that the quality of previous cards was quite shoddy so...

412
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,200
How did the meeting go?

413
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,500
It was great, presentation went pretty well Demo was amazing so..

414
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We pitched it well, he liked it

415
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Yeah meeting was great

416
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,000
Did you talk to Dad?

417
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,000
No

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,800
Actually I could talk to my Dad only He was asking about you and dad

419
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
I have a hunch that dad knows about it

420
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,800
So, I think first I should talk to you and then dad

421
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
Why? you should talk to dad first

422
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
How can you married couple can tell the difference between whose dad we're talking about

423
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay, I'll talk to dad but should I say?

424
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Say what you always say

425
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,000
I know we disagree with him but we don't disrespect him. You should call him

426
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Puneet is calling

427
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah, hi Puneet Its Yogi here

428
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah look Yogi, I couldn't find the name directly

429
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,500
But I have Bhardwaj's last week schedule right in front of me

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,500
I have the details of all of his previous meetings

431
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Can you check if he had any meeting with Rastogi?

432
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
Yeah, check for a Rastogi

433
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
No no Rastogi with an R, yes

434
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
There's no Rastogi here Yogi

435
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,300
No Rastogi?

436
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,500
Why don't you check alphabetically? and tell me the names starting from A

437
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,400
There are almost 80 names here, I have already cross checked the list

438
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,000
Either they are big companies or already funded startups

439
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,000
There's only one slot left with no name but just an Email ID

440
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What is the Email ID?

441
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,000
Some peculiar ID, yes...

442
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
dungeon_master@hotmail.com there's an underscore between dungeon and master

443
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,370
FUCK!!!!!!!!!!

444
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh fuck!

445
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,870
Why did you choose this place to talk about such an important matter

446
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,120
We could've gone to a restaurant

447
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Maybe because I wanted to walk down the aisle with you once

448
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,000
Good to know, that your sense of humour is still intact

449
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,000
And good to see, that your "career comes first" ideology is still intact

450
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Naveeeeeen!

451
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,000
Please say it

452
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,000
Just say it once that I love you, I can't live without you, please don't leave me

453
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,000
Shreya, I love you, I can't live without you

454
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,000
But please go

455
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,500
We'll try and figure out something

456
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,500
Like what?

457
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,000
Long distance?

458
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,000
You know that never works

459
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
I might never come back

460
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,500
You can't move there and I can't be here

461
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Let's not try to take the easy way out, okay?

462
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:37,000
There's still time. I'll give you a coin, make the trial room your jury room

463
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,000
That is not gonna change anything

464
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,500
I know you too well you know thats the problem

465
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,500
You're getting very predictable you know

466
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,400
You're not instigating me, please stop trying

467
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Listen, really? You're letting me go? me?

468
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You're letting this and this and these and that go?

469
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,500
Do you realize how tough it is to get this combination?

470
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
It won't be tough, it will be impossible

471
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,300
But its your job You have to do it

472
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,700
You know that your work is the only thing that will be here long after you're gone

473
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Naveen, that's just a figure of speech

474
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,120
We're not Gandhi, Newton or Shakespeare

475
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,920
Our work is just gonna get buried with our graves Its as simple as that

476
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,620
That is not true Shreya

477
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,570
Hold on a minute

478
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,000
What is this?

479
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,000
Your head

480
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,900
What nonsense?

481
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,000
Go on tell me what's this?

482
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,400
Its a bottle, what else?

483
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,000
Who built it?

484
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,000
How would I know?

485
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,900
You know when man used to live in caves 1000 years ago...

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Are you kidding me? We are going that back, are we?

487
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,600
Yeah we are going that back Listen to me

488
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,100
He would find it arduous to draw water from the rivers

489
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,320
Then someone made a water container made of leaves But it wasn't durable

490
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Then someone noticed that exposing wet soil to direct sunlight turns it into clay

491
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And then someone else made a pot from that very clay

492
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,000
But that wasn't durable either

493
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,400
Then someone invented plastic

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
And then someone else thought plastic would make a durable container

495
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Then someone else designed its shape, another person made it transparent

496
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,000
Someone discovered the caps, and someone designed the threads of the cap

497
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,000
And someone made a whole factory to manufacture bottles

498
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,000
in which thousands of people work just to make these bottles

499
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Millions of people have been working for so many years, Shreya so that we can make use of these bottles

500
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,900
Maybe we don't acknowledge it but...

501
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,500
...there work is still here long after they're gone

502
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And this is just a bottle, Shreya

503
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,500
look at your surroundings You're standing at a museum of human work history

504
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Just look around

505
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,000
And what better place to prove your point, right?

506
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Like always you're right Mr. Bansal

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Will you miss me?

508
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,200
On some lonely nights, maybe

509
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
You?

510
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,000
Every night

511
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,000
Pervert prick

512
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,000
Well, I'll have to do something

513
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Promise me that you'll give me a window of 3 months before you start seeing someone else

514
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Okay, and you also don't go on a selfie spree once you're in London

515
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
Okay done

516
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,900
We were sort of a soulmates type, right?

517
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,800
We would be marrying for sure if I had been here

518
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Thank god it didn't happen

519
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,870
So, technically we're breaking up

520
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,770
We never got into technicalities baby

521
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,000
No, I'm saying that because...

522
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,000
...it makes for a breakup sex for one last time

523
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,000
Ofcourse

524
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm leaving for home tonight for one week, We'll get to that once I'm back

525
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,050
Anyway, I'll be leaving next week...

526
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,000
Okay, listen

527
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,900
I think I should go now

528
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I have a flight to catch in the evening and I haven't even started packing yet

529
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,000
Okay?

530
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
I'll talk to you tomorrow

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Listen...

532
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Here, keep this

533
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,900
- What's this? - 1767 (*PIN no.)

534
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,500
Why are you giving me your credit card? what nonsense?

535
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,000
Don't be a hero in front of me, I know your financial situation

536
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,750
Groceries are on me for a month, okay?

537
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And its not a gift, I'm giving you a loan

538
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,120
You can pay me later

539
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay?

540
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,400
Naveen

541
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Naveen don't do this, not here, okay?

542
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
You know I can't leave like this

543
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
What happened?

544
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,000
I had to do a lot of sacrifices for the startup

545
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,000
I gave up a decent job, decent salary, good stantard of living

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And it never bothered me

547
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But now you are sacrificing for my work

548
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,200
It hurts me a lot

549
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,000
Hurts like hell

550
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But if didn't hurt then its not gonna be a sacrifice, right?

551
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,900
And there'll be a time when you're gonna be on the cover of TIME magazine

552
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
then this'll all seem worth it

553
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,000
But just please make sure that happens, okay?

554
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
For us, Okay?

555
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
Bye, I'll call you

556
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Thats why I was getting a lot of Emails lately regarding Hair therapy

557
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
He's been fucking with me since 6 months

558
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
And you were gonna replace me with him?

559
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
Yeah because of financial crunch

560
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Learn to apologize, Yogi

561
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,000
Nah, apologies are stupid

562
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,000
But I'm sure these assholes will be grovelling when I'll stamp their asses with my shoes

563
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,000
Yogi please, you ought to be calm

564
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,000
You're in a black mood since morning, let me handle this with patience

565
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,400
Okay but if they aggravated me, I'll fuck their shit up

566
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:29,000
They are only 17 years old kids, I'll talk some sense into them

567
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Allright, you talk and I'll kick Okay? lets go

568
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,000
And they're lucky that I didn't put on my woodland shoes today

569
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
The fuck happened here?

570
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Where are those blockheads from last time?

571
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What's that? Looks like someone took a shit here

572
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
Come on hurry up, lets do our business

573
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Come Yogi, come we were waiting for you

574
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,000
you guys knew we were coming?

575
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
No no, we just like to sit like this everynight from 8 to 10

576
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,500
We got a hold of main gate's CCTV surveilance right here

577
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,300
Baby, you got your dramatic entry, Can I go now?

578
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,000
Yeah okay

579
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,700
you're taking me to spa in the evening, right?

580
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Banali, I'm working

581
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,500
Look guys...

582
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
You know why we are here

583
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,000
It took a lot of elbow grease for us to make that product

584
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,000
You guys did a mistake and its illegal too

585
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,000
And you guys are just kids in college, we're not gonna lodge a complaint against you

586
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,000
You made a mistake, its alright.

587
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,500
You just need to call Bhardwaj and backout

588
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,500
Relax, we're not taking any action against you

589
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,000
Jeetu, this guy is very cute

590
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,000
If you'll track the IP address, you'll get Mulund's cyber cafe

591
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,000
You ain't got shit on me

592
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,500
Look, we have all the proofs which claims that this is our idea

593
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,000
I'm telling you for your own good, you guys are in college

594
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,000
You'll get into trouble when your parents get to know about it

595
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,500
i'm not scared of my parents

596
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,000
If our parents had enough time to reprove us...

597
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,000
...then you wouldn't be dealing with a brat like me

598
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,300
Hold on a second, Jeetu Give me your phone

599
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Give me your phone and I'll tell these fucks who to call. Ambulance or Bhardwaj?

600
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
Give me your phone

601
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,000
have you met Reddy?

602
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Reddy was very fond of video chatting

603
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,800
He cajoled a Bulgarian girl on omegle

604
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then every night he used to skype with her, doing some nasty nasty...

605
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,500
But little did he know that I was recording all the chats

606
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,000
And one day...

607
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,000
I uploaded all the video chats on the internet

608
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,000
It took him a lot of grovelling to do for me to take those videos down

609
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,400
And this is my best friend we're talking about

610
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,000
While you are a mutual friend of my father's third cousin

611
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,000
You gonna login at 1 AM tonight, right?

612
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,000
Svetlana is a single mom

613
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,900
And also an entrepreneur in many ways

614
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,300
41gb material, Reddy just got a new hard drive for it

615
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,000
It helped a lot during dry day, say her thanks for me

616
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Dare not touch, Yogi

617
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Got a free router with my new computer

618
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,300
Wanna test the upload speed?

619
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
Guys, please...

620
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Bill stomped on Steve to create Microsoft

621
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,200
Then who are you?

622
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,200
Go back the same way you came

623
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,000
If you even tried to contact Bhardwaj...

624
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,500
...then Yogi-Svetlana's folder won't only be in Reddy's hard drive

625
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Okay, lets go

626
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,000
Assholes

627
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,000
Entrepreneurs?

628
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,600
Telling me to backout

629
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Hey Jeetu, come on I'm not convinced yet

630
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,000
Come and convince me that I should backout

631
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,000
Convince me asshole

632
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,600
What did you say?

633
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Convince me

634
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
Convince you?

635
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Out of the way

636
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,500
What are you doing?

637
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
This motherfucker asked me to convince him

638
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,500
First I convinced my wife, then my dad, then my family

639
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Son of a bitch is just 17

640
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Motherfucker, my i7-4790k edition

641
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
What are you? some gangsters?

642
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,100
We're not gangsters

643
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
We are entrepreneurs, motherfucker

644
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You know how much it costs to get your child into junior KG?

645
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Do you have any idea about house mortgaging?

646
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,300
I went to the grocery store yesterday

647
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,000
You know how much does baby corn cost?

648
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,900
Rs 120 per 100 grams

649
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh my, Rs 1200 per kg? Damn!

650
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
What did I want?

651
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:43,000
That you get your seed fund and I get my promotion, Is that too much to ask for?

652
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,200
You hardly faced a challenge and 25% percent of the team has resigned already

653
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,300
Puneet, he has switched off his phone, how is that our fault?

654
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Naveen, talk some sense itno him dude

655
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
I'm tired of talking now, you should do it

656
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,600
Is this the team that I've advocated for?

657
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,900
This CEO attends meeting without even taking a shower or freshen up

658
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,900
This CEO curses and bullies people

659
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,300
This CTO vandalizes the computers

660
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,500
This seems like a million dollar team, howcome no one has decided to fund you yet?

661
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,000
Puneet, he's coming

662
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Alright let bygones be bygones, just don't say anything to Bhardwaj

663
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,000
I'll do the talking, okay?

664
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,500
Okay lets go

665
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,500
Are you alright? you seem gloomy

666
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
Hi guys, sorry I got stuck on a call

667
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
How're you guys doing?

668
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,900
Good, sir

669
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,100
Where is uhh...

670
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,000
Uhh Manda...uhh Saurabh is unwell actually so he won't be joining us today

671
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
Okay, no problem

672
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ankit, I was talking to Naveen and these guys really want to renegotiate the terms

673
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,400
Puneet, can you sit this one out?

674
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,300
I'm really sorry but I want to talk to the guys directly

675
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:02,000
So, if you can take a break, it'd be great

676
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I know this means a lot to you, you've worked very hard on your product

677
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,000
And, I really appreciate the amount of hard work that you've put in

678
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700
But...

679
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Last night I had a chat with the other team And...

680
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
They are offering me a much better deal now

681
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,200
From here on I can virtually own that company

682
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,000
So... I have no reason why I shouldn't invest in them

683
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,700
But don't you think sir its.. what they have done is illegal?

684
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,200
Like we've got our product registered and there are copywrite laws...

685
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,300
You can copywrite a product but you can't copywrite an idea

686
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,900
Selling goods online is an idea

687
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon they are all selling it

688
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,300
I think sir its extremely unfair to us

689
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,000
-Like we've been working on this for... -Look guys...

690
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,000
As a human being, I genuinely feel sorry for you

691
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,500
But as an investor, I can't let that feeling come in my way

692
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,000
And if I want to do a business then I ought to look out for my self interest, right?

693
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,000
Sir like, Puneet knew about it since the beginning

694
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,900
May I come in, sir?

695
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Saurabh?

696
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,100
I thought you were sick

697
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Too bad you came all the way because...

698
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
I have nothing but bad news for you

699
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,100
Its okay sir, but can I give you a presentation?

700
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,000
Presentation? I just told them that I've made up my mind and there's no point in...

701
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,600
Please sir

702
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,000
I spent Rs 35000 to make this presentation

703
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,300
I know you have seen all the company documents but sir this will make our company really big

704
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,500
I'll need just 2 minutes sir

705
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Alright, go ahead

706
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Naveen's Team by Saurabh Mandal

707
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,700
This team consists of 4 members

708
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,700
Naveen Bansal

709
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Jitendra Maheshwari

710
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Yogendra Kumar Pandey

711
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,000
And me, Saurabh Mandal

712
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:28,000
Let's begin with Jeetu

713
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,300
All of us have a Mr Sharma's son(*Stereotypical intellectual son) in our life

714
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,400
But in Bikaner's Government high school, there was a Mr Maheshwari's son

715
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,000
Jitendra Maheshwari

716
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:45,000
Sir, I've never seen a live performance of Backstreet Boys

717
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,900
But I've seen Jeetu writing code

718
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Continuously for 36 hours, without any sleep

719
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,900
He could've easily gone to US to work for facebook

720
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
But he didn't leave India for his family's sake

721
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,000
Afterall he is a family man

722
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,000
And now for the first time in his life he went against his family for this startup

723
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Why? Why did he do it?

724
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,000
Yogi

725
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:23,300
Sir, some people know very few people

726
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,600
Some people know most of the people

727
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,700
But Yogi knows everyone

728
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Naveen told me that when they visited Gujarat(*Dry state) Yogi arranged for a beer at 4 in the morning

729
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,000
I learned more about Cost cutting from Yogi than from my MBA lectures

730
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,100
He bought a cake of just Rs. 25 for his birthday

731
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,000
He had a CGPA of just 5.3(out of 10)

732
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,000
But he got a salary package of Rs 2.2 million

733
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,500
He would've been the Mumbai regional head in just 2 years had he been working there

734
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
But then why did he leave his job for this startup? Why is he fighting tooth and nail for this startup?

735
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
Only to let his hair fall?

736
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,000
Why?

737
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
And finally

738
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Naveen Bansal

739
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,000
I love watching movies

740
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,900
In the end of every movie, there's director's name written under "A film by"

741
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,400
I used to get angry by seeing that

742
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,400
I mean...

743
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:29,000
Actor acts, writer writes and cinematographer shoots the film

744
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:34,000
Then what does the director do that he gets such a special attention

745
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
All he has to do is to make a choice Good or bad

746
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,000
But Naveen has realised me that choices are the most challenging things in life

747
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,400
Sir, this whole idea is Naveen's

748
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,000
This is his product

749
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,000
This is his team

750
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,000
If there's anyone in this world for whom we all can take a bullet

751
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,000
This is the gentleman sitting over here

752
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
For this team, he made our home office and his own home was turned itno a warehouse

753
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,500
This is the man who didn't like to iron his own shirts, who now volunteers to launder all of our clothes

754
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,600
All of us have done a lot of sacrifices for each other

755
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,800
But Naveen has done a lot more than that to shield us

756
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,900
Why is Naveen doing all this?

757
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
All of us

758
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:32,000
Why all of us are so hell-bent for this startup?

759
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
I'll tell you why sir

760
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,400
Because we all want to reach here

761
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,900
And we're not waiting for any boat

762
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,400
We're already swimming in the sea of unknown

763
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,000
We've already left our comfort zone long ago

764
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,600
Now we don't care about the changes, challenges or sacrifices we'll have to face

765
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,400
No matter what

766
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Our team will reach here, where magic happens

767
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,500
And what do you do in your team?

768
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Sir, I don't have any value individually

769
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,600
I'm a zero

770
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But the net value increases by 10 times when I add up

771
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,400
You've made your point

772
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,000
Now let me make my point very clear

773
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
No matter which team gets here

774
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,900
It's ultimately going to be me who's going to shape their idea and make them a bigger company

775
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You need business business expertise to build this things

776
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And, at the risk of sounding arrogant let me tell you guys that

777
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,500
The team which I shall support, that team would be the strongest

778
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,500
And that team will make a bigger company

779
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And I think you guys are forgetting that, I've already decided to back the other team

780
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,500
Sir, you're also forgetting something

781
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Yours is not the only island in the sea

782
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,000
There are other magical islands

783
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,500
Who'll be more than happy to have us on the shore

784
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So you're saying that...

785
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You've offers from other investors as well?

786
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Sir, do you really think that we presented our product to just one investor?

787
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And who are these investors exactly?

788
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Sorry sir, I can't reveal their names at this point of time

789
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,000
You know my reputation guys

790
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,000
If I reject your idea, then no one will dare to invest here with you

791
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,500
And sir you know our perseverance

792
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,700
We'll surely make it up to there

793
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,000
Either in your portfolio or in your anti-portfolio

794
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,450
I play poker a lot

795
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
I know a bluff when I see one

796
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:25,000
You have no other offers

797
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,500
You're trying to play on my fear of losing out

798
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,500
When the fact is...

799
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
Apart from me

800
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,000
You've nowhere else to go

801
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,300
Sir, the ball is still in your court

802
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,200
Stay here Mandal, where are you going?

803
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,000
No, I'm going home

804
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,000
I have to draft a formal resignation letter

805
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,500
Whatever happened to your "perseverance" and "making up to the island"?

806
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,500
Now that we're telling you to stay, you're walking out

807
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,000
No, too much emotional attachment is bad

808
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,500
Whatever happened, happened for the best

809
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,900
Sit-down asshole

810
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,500
Didn't you hear me asshole? come back

811
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,500
Why do you want me to stay if I'm an asshole?

812
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,000
Because you're my friend motherfucker

813
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,900
Come on now, sit-down here

814
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,900
I won't

815
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It was just a presentation, don't try to be a hero now

816
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,900
I was in a black mood yesterday, come on back here

817
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
I said I won't

818
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,500
I know I overreacted yesterday, try to understand what I'm saying

819
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,000
understand what?

820
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,000
That I'm saying sorry motherfucker

821
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Now come back here or I'll whoop your ass

822
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's okay I forgive you

823
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
We got it

824
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
We go it Jeetu

825
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,000
Guys put me down

826
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I told you what my pen drive could do

827
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,000
Cheers

828
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,900
Let's take about 10 such pitchers to home, we'll get some fine quality beer with a lot of froth

829
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,600
We've only got 10% of the seed fund, don't fuck this up before paperwork

830
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,000
Says the guy who recently fucked it up in a hostel

831
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,500
It was exhilerating though, wasn't it?

832
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
Half of my frustration was because you broke my phone

833
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,000
Give me your phone, I need to talk to Soumya

834
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:20,200
Naveen, I think our new office should be in the vicinity of Powai lake

835
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,900
The research says that if you see water every morning, your blood cells are tend to increase by 12%

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,300
We can hardly afford 1 BHK there fucker

837
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,000
We need someone for UYOS, Jeetu needs a developer, we need an office setup, I need an intern

838
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,000
Don't worry, our CEO Mr. Bansal will give us everything. We'll get everything

839
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
No one ever gets everything dude

840
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,500
There are some things which are never meant to be yours

841
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
What the hell happened to you?

842
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
No nothing, I'm just kidding

843
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Okay you guys enjoy, I need to make a phone call

844
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,000
Naveen? hi

845
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,500
Hey Rathore, how are you bro?

846
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,800
I'm doing great, what about you?

847
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,900
You were in final year, what are you doing here?

848
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,900
No no, I graduated last year I have a job here now

849
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
That's great. you've grown up

850
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,900
No dude, you're the one who's doing great

851
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,400
I just liked your facebook status

852
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,900
Oh, so you know about it?

853
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Congratulations man, you aced it

854
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm feeling very jealous from you right now

855
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,200
Your life is gonna be awesome dude

856
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,000
While we will only get to fill excel sheets in our office

857
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,300
I've only got weekends to enjoy

858
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Although I also thought about opening a startup but I couldn't give it enough time

859
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And even if I got enough time, nobody's luck is as good as yours

860
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,000
Tell me one thing...

861
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
What are you?
