1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,620
在這個瞬息萬變的世界中，最大的風險是不承擔任何風險

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,570
唯一可以保證失敗的策略就是不承擔風險

3
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,210
謝謝，先生

It will be out in Sunday's Business Outlook... Take a look yourself!

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,780
巴蒂，快告訴我，6000萬？
Bhati, tell me, 60?

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,480
這是官方數據，我現在不能透露
It's official, I can't reveal it now.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,090
多少錢，7500萬？
How much, 75?

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,880
別告訴我是一億！
Now don't tell me it's 100.

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,700
媽的! ! ！
F**K!!!

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,580
一億？
100?

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,130
一個億？
A hundred million?

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,150
巴蒂，你公司的估價是五億美元？
Bhati, your company's evaluation is half a billion dollars?

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,380
媽的! ! ！
F**K!!!

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,880
這有什麼大不了的？
So what's the big deal?

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,200
還比 Flipkart 少了75億美元呢
It's still lesser than Flipkart by 7.5 billion.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,630

Bhati, it means one of my college seniors is going to be a billionaire!

28
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,110

F**K, what luck!

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,400
這與命運或運氣無關……
It's not about fate or luck...

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:42,650
印度管理學院？
IIM?

31
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,930
印度管理學院史瑞拉姆夫人女子學院
LSR. IIM.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,330
我應該作為 CAT 出場的
I should have appeared for CAT.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,060
你所做的一切，就是喋喋不休地談論我的運氣
All you do, is keep harping about my luck.

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,560
你已經把你的創業想法跟我說過無數次了
You've told me about your start-up idea over a 100 times now.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,780
你為什麼著手去做？
Why don't you do something about it?

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,900
一個新的矽穀正在這裏崛起
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,200
而你卻仍然在 Mokart 上銷售那些廉價的山寨手機
And you are still selling these cheap chinese phones on Mokart.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,080
- 他們很有說服力，巴蒂 - 胡說
They're exculsive, Bhati. -Bullshit.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
老弟，冇那麼簡單
Son, its not that easy.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,170
辭掉你的工作，出去創業
Leave your job and venture into the market.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,630
然後你就會知道，命運到底是由什麼組成的
And then you will learn, what destinies are made of and from.

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,000
老弟你搞什麼? 還在喝第一杯啤酒？
Dude, what the f**k? Still on your first beer?

43
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,350
快點喝完！
Down it!

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,800
我不喝了，巴蒂
I'm good, Bhati.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:18,900
再給他來杯啤酒
Beer for him.

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,070
再給他來杯啤酒
Beer for him.

47
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,730
巴蒂，我8:30要早起上班
Bhati, I have to wake up early at 8:30 for work.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,450
閉嘴! ! ！
Shut up!!!

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,120
巴蒂，我現在已經變得非常自律了
Bhati, I've become very discipled now.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,440
甚至不需要鬨鍾就能醒來
Nowadays I don't even need an alarm to wake up..

51
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,360
不去上班嗎？
Not going to the office?

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,390
你在這兒幹什麼？
What are you doing here?

53
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,730
我開了熱水器
I switched on the geyser

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
正在燒水
The water's still heating up.

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,760
曼達爾，你為什麼在我的浴室裏洗澡？
Mandal why do you take a bath in my bathroom?

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,860
我的桶把手壞了
The handle of my bucket is broken.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,810
那你可以把我的桶拿到你的浴室去啊
So, take my bucket to your bathroom.

58
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
實際上，我今天想洗個淋浴
Actually, I feel like taking a shower today.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,770
大哥，你完全可以在自己的浴室洗淋浴啊
Dude, you can take a shower even in your own bathroom.

60
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
一定是水燒好了了！
The water must've heated up!

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,780
至少別用我的毛巾啊
Atleast spare my towel.

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,060
Mokart 把我坑慘了，巴蒂，從頭坑到尾
Mokart f**ked me over Bhati. Completely f**ked me.

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,260
我為這個巴西的項目付出了很多努力
I put in so much effort into this Brazil project.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,400
甚至周日也加班工作

Must've made more than 5000 excel sheets.

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,650
當需要指定項目負責人的時候，竟然冇選我，他們另外派人去裏約
And when it came down to leading the team, instead of me, they sent someone else to Rio.

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
巴蒂，我要報仇！
Bhati, I will take revenge!

69
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,340
我一定要報仇！
I will take revenge for sure!

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
我一定會找他們報仇的，巴蒂
I will even avenge them, Bhati.

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,630
一旦我拿到融資
Once I get the funding

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,290
我會賺很多錢，巴蒂... 很多錢
I'll make so much money Bhati... So much money

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,290
我要把Mokart買下來，然後……
I'll buy Mokart and...

74
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,910
然後在 OLX 上賣了，操他媽的
And sell it on OLX, f**king shit.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,980
但是我要怎麼做呢，巴蒂？
But how, Bhati?

76
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,360
我怎樣才能融到錢，巴蒂？
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

77
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,740
不是每個人的運氣都像你那麼好
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

78
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,300
你是什麼？
What are you?

79
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,580
什麼意思？
What do you mean, what am I?

80
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,160
你是什麼？

81
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,460
我是mokart. com的區域經理，納文·班薩爾
I am the Executive Regional Manager, Navin Bansal, Mokart.com

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,900

83
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,290
-區域經理…… -你是啤酒

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,720
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

85
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,840
你是啤酒，混蛋
You're beer, motherf**ker.

86
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,810
你是啤酒
You're beer.

87
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,520
這個瓶子呢? 這是你的公司
And this bottle here? This is your company

88
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,020
你以為，如果你能到玻璃杯裏麵
You think, you'll get into the glass.

89
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,990
你會玩得很開心
You will have fun.

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,860
不是嗎？
Isn't it?

91
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,910
但是看看這個
But look at this.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,520
看到了嗎？
Can you see?

93
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,470
你實際上不想離開啤酒瓶
You actually don't want to leave the bottle.

94
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,520
想把啤酒倒進杯子裏，它需要先離開啤酒瓶
For the beer to get into the glass... It needs to leave the bottle first

95
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,470
一旦你從瓶子裏出來
Once you're out of the bottle

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,600
你就可以進入任何你想要的玻璃杯
Then you can get into any glass you want.

97
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,490
可以是這個杯子，如果你想要的話
In this glass, if you want.

98
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,990
或者你也可以到這個玻璃杯
Or you can get into this glass

99
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,540
-甚至是在這個杯子裏 -這是一個葡萄酒杯
Even in this glass. -Its a wine glass.

100
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,960
你怎麼知道的？
How the hell do YOU know that?

101
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,590
你是啤酒
You are beer.

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,130
明白了嗎？
Get it?

103
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,500
你想去哪兒就去哪兒
You can go wherever you want.

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,810
明白嗎？
Understand?

105
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,440
但是首先你得從瓶子裏出來
But it's quintissential you come out of the bottle, first.

106
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,510
一旦你出來了，你可以裝滿一半的杯子
Once you are out, you could fill half the glass

107
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,700
也可能不會
Or maybe you won't.

108
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,030
但是如果你不出來
But if you don't come out

109
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,710
那你肯定填不滿，看到了嗎
Then you'll definitely not be able to fill it. Look here.

110
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,450
你的工作不是問問題
And its not your job to ask the questions.

111
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,690
你是啤酒
You're beer.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,010
你的工作就是流動
And your job is to flow.

113
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,020
你是啤酒
You are beer.

114
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,270
這是啤酒
This is beer.

115
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,390
不是玻璃杯
Not glass.

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,770
事實上冇有玻璃杯
Infact there is no glass.

117
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,550
但是桌子上有一個玻璃杯，巴蒂
But there is a glass on the table, Bhati.

118
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
冇有
No glass.

119
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
我是啤酒，巴蒂
I am a beer, Bhati.

120
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,900
我是啤酒
I am beer.

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,160
我要從啤酒瓶裏出來
And I'll get out of the bottle.

122
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
我會從瓶子裏出來……
I will get out of the bottle...

123
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,950
你要吃早餐嗎？
Will you have breakfast?

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,380
嗯
Yes

125
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,620
你想吃什麼？
What do you want to eat?

126
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,760
麵包 煎蛋卷
Bread Omlett.

127
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,200
我們冇有雞蛋了
We've no eggs left.

128
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,630
麵包 果醬
Bread Jam.

129
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,580
哪種，混合水果還是芒果？

130
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,640
混合水果

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,910
混合水果上個星期就冇有了！
The mixed fruit one, got done with, last week itself!

132
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,640
那就芒果吧！

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,330
我們根本就冇有芒果果醬！
We didn't get any mango in the first place!

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
就給我烤麵包吧
Just toast the bread for me.

135
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,790
烤麵包機已經壞了很久了
The toaster's been broken for such a long time, now!

136
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,340
老哥，我就喝杯茶就夠了
Dude, one cup tea will do.

But I already used all the milk for the curd!

138
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,830

早餐是一天中最重要的一餐

143
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,660
你的"電池"會開始滲漏，你母親…… -老哥，請讓我一個人靜一靜
Your 'battery' will start seeping. Your mom.... -Dude, please leave me alone.

144
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,700

我是啤酒，巴蒂

我會從酒瓶裏出來

給他一杯啤酒
One beer for him.

153
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,980
巴蒂，聽著，巴蒂

我現在就辭職

160
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,260
我馬上給他打電話

161
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,340
- 你瘋了嗎?-我現在就辭職我才不管
-Have you gone mad? -I will resign right now, I don't give a F**K.

等白天再打電話

168
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,200
你覺得我會害怕嗎？
Do you think, I'm scared?

169
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,810
我是個懦夫嗎？
Am I a coward?

170
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,450
我什麼時候說過..
When did I say that...

171
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
我會證明給你看，我會證明給你看

你以為我不能從瓶子裏出來嗎? 我是啤酒，我會流..
You think I can't get out of the bottle? I am a beer and I will flow...

174
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,710
拉傑？
Rajat?

175
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,180
拉傑，很抱歉這個時候打電話給你
Rajat, I am so sorry that I am calling you this hour.

176

There's something very important, I want to tell you!

177
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,140
拉傑，你是個混蛋! ! ！
Rajat you're an a**hole!!!

178
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,710
還有你的部門
And your department

179
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,270
事實上，你的整個公司就是一個糞坑
Infact your whole company, is an a**hole.

180
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,970
所以你和你的公司可以從我的生活中消失了
So you and your company are fired from my life.

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,610
晚安，拉傑 · 欣德
Good night, Jai Hind.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
去你媽的

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,390
那是我的酒！
That's my drink!!!

185
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,740
對不起..
Sorry...

186
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,080
真的嗎? 你是印度管理學院的？
Really? Are you from IIM?

187
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,280
這是誰？
Whose this?

188
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,170
先生

189
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
親愛的先生

190
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,850
敬愛的先生，我真的很抱歉

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,570
什麼事，八卦？
Yaa Chatty, tell me

192
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,550
但是美國國家航空航天局秘密會議的結果應該在下周公佈，不是嗎？
But NasCom conclave's result where supposed to be out next week, weren't they?

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720
阿克希爾，誰？
Akhil, who?

194
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,740
哦，那個家夥
Ohh the hostel 4 guy.

195
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,870
他在納斯康嗎？
Is he in Nascom?

196
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,250
好的
OK.

197
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,700
那麼... 他說了什麼？
So..What did he say?

198
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,220
開什麼玩笑！
You've got to be kidding me!

199
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,470
你確定嗎？
Are you sure?

200
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,520
確認？
Confirmed?

201
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,230
我的 b 計畫會被選中嗎？
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

202
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,410
媽的! ! ！
F**K!!!

203
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,280
真幸運！
What luck!

204
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,480
你確定嗎？
Are you sure?

205
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,100
謝謝，謝謝，謝謝老哥
Thanks, thanks, thanks dude...

206
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,970
那好吧，我會告訴其他人
Ok then, I'll tell the others as well

207
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,890
不，等正式公佈之後我再更新狀態
No, no.. Let it get official first. I'll update my status after!

208
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,090
好的
OK.

209
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,620
我晚上再和你談，好嗎？
I'll talk to you in the evening, alright?

210
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,430
好的，保重，再見
Ok. Take care. Bye.

211
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,480
小文文
Naveen

212
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,220
你真是個不負責任的人
You are so irresponsible man.

213
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,660
這東西就在你的馬桶後麵
This was lying behind your commode.

214
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,000
我該怎麼處理它？
What do I do with it?

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,070
拜托你件事，曼達爾
Now do one thing Mandal.

216
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,020
這個? 扔到垃圾桶裏去！

217
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,320
合理分配時間，你是公司非常重要的員工

218
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,370
節約用水，你是公司非常重要的員工

219
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,760
他把我叫到辦公室，開始對我大喊大叫！
He called me in the office and started yelling at me!

220
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,030
我說”先生
I said, "Sir

221
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,170
……如果你對我的睡眠時間有疑問
..if you have so much problem with me sleeping..

222
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,440
那麼你應該把我轉到人力資源部
..then tranfer me to HR department..

223
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,220
他們甚至可以得到額外的睡眠獎勵”
They even get an extra bonus for sleeping, there"

224
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,600
吸煙有害健康，你是公司非常重要的員工

225
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,940
傑圖 兄弟！
Jeetu bro!

226
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,570

恭喜..
Congrats...

228
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,210
還有煙嗎？
Do you have an extra?

229
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,080
冇了，這是最後一支
No, it's the last one.

230
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,530
冇事，把煙吹到我臉上
No issue. Blow it on my face.

231
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,510
被動抽兩口也行
Passive will also do!

232
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620
恭喜什麼？
Congrats for what?

233
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,370
別裝了
Now don't pretend!

234
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,410
你的評估太棒了！
You were amazing in the appraisal!

235
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,700
順便問一下，你看了昨晚的《納克 · 巴利耶》嗎？
By the way, did you watch last night's Nach Baliye??

236
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,760
切坦 · 巴加特很棒，他隻是... ..
Chetan bhagat was awesome. He just..

237
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,000
你是怎麼知道的？
How did you get to know about it?

238
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,520
昨晚看的，晚上9點的節目
Saw it last night. The 9pm show.

239
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,380
然後又看了11:30的重播
And then again, the 11:30 repeat telecast.

240
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,180
不，我是說評估，你怎麼知道的？
No, I mean about the appraisal. How do you know about that?

241
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,390
評估? 哦! ！
Appraisal ? Ohh!!!

242
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,700
喬希先生給我們看過
Joshi sir showed it to us.

243
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,260
即便是“成就箱”也不夠大
Even the 'Acheivement box' wasn't big enough.

244
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,980
雖然我什麼都冇得到過
Though I didn't really get one thing!

245
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,670
但是為什麼你在自我評價中給自己打了4分？
Why did you gave yourself 4 out of 5 in the self evaluation?

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,780
我就知道! 我應該給自己3.5..
I knew it! I should've given myself 3.5...

247
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,570
3.5分？
3.5?

248
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,120
你應該給自己5分
You should've given yourself 5 out of 5.

249
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,600
還不夠完美嗎？
What more could you possibly do?

250
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,720
告訴我，你還能做些什麼？
No tell me, what more can you do?

251
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,000
傑圖，我能告訴你一些事情嗎？
Jeetu, can I tell you something?

252
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,510
每當我們拿到你寫的代碼
Whenever we get a code written by you

253
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,380
我們直接上傳，都不用測試
We forward it, without even testing it

254
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,050
為什麼要浪費時間呢？
Why waste time, by running it?

255
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,910
喬希先生一直稱贊你
And Joshi sir keeps praising you always.

256
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:44,940
對了，市場部的迪維亞
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

257
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,700
對了，市場部的迪維亞
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

258
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,560
今天是她的訂婚日
It's her engagement today.

259
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,100
你會來嗎？
Will you come?

260
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,070
喬希先生說了什麼？
What was Joshi sir saying?

261
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,280
喬希先生說，他會來的！
Joshi sir said, he will come!

262
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,130
實際上……
Actually what happened was...

263
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,620
不是 我是說喬希先生說我什麼了？
No!!! No!! I meant what was Joshi sir saying about me?

264
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,130
你剛才說的……
You said something...

265
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,050
哦
Ohh

266
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,000
不僅是喬希先生
Not only Joshi sir

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,050
而是整個部門都這麼說
But the whole department says this.

268
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,540
而是整個部門都這麼說
But the whole department says this.

269
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,620
"不管別人怎麼樣，你一定會升職的"
"Whether or not someone else does... you are defintely getting promoted"

270
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,110
冇有別的可能
And there's no two ways about it.

271
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,680
好了，我該走了，我還有工作要做
OK!!! I should be going, I have work to do.

272
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,720
吃塊口香糖
Take a chewing gum.

273

太多的工作要做……

277
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,760
明天別忘了吃甜蛋餅

Give them 10 of these and get them energized

Sir, but they need to charge their laptops. not phones.

290
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,710
那就告訴該死的技術支持去幫助技術支持，下一個
Well then tell the f**king tech support to help tech support, in all the matters of tech support. Next.

296
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,090
反對無效

先生，所有新來的銷售實習生都在等待入職
Sir, all the new sales interns are waiting for their induction

299
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,350
叫他們在會議室集合

300
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,760
但是先生，那個房間的空調壞了，裏麵很熱
But sir, the AC in that room is not working. It's very hot in there.

Good, it's the first day they need to feel the heat.

302

308
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,000
我跟你們講
So guys, let me tell you.

309
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,000
給客戶留下深刻印象就像是
Impressing your client is like impressing a girl

310
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,370
在給鎮上所有男人都在追的女孩留下深刻印象
that every man in the town is after.

311
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,870
而這個女孩，根本不想見你
And this girl, doesn't even want to meet you.

不想接你的電話
Doesn't want to pick up your calls.

313
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,010
事實上，她根本不認識你
Infact, she doesn't even know you.

314
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,050
她討厭你
She f**king hates you.

315
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,040
現在，你要怎麼做才能打動這樣一個女孩呢？
Now, what will you do to impress such a girl?

316
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,070
先生，我會威脅說要割腕，先生
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

317
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,480
先生，我會威脅說要割腕，先生
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

318
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,170
也許可以作為達到目標的最後手段
Yeah, maybe, as a last resort to meet the targets.

319
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,770
但是，你會從什麼開始呢？
But, what will you begin with?

320
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,290
你永遠不放棄! ! ！

321
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,120
你永遠不會罷休

322
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,630
你必須像對待你的女朋友一樣對待你的客戶
You have to treat your client, like your girlfriend.

323
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,530
嚮他們展示你的忠誠
Show them your loyalty.

324
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,090
帶他們出去喝咖啡

一天三次
Call them thrice a day.

326
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,370
記住他們的生日
Remember their birthdays.

327
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,200
甚至每天晚上打飛機的時候都要想著你的客戶
In fact, fantasize about your client every night.

328
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,020
好的，先生，每！天！晚！上！

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,990
不管情況如何
Whatever the situation may be.

334
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,140

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,030
T...

406
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,870
要成為一個企業家，你不需要會拚寫，有創業精神就夠了
To be an entrepreneur, you don't need the spelling but the spirit.

407
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,390
納文，現在終於有好事發生在我的生活中了！
Naveen, its now that finally something good's happening in my life!

408
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,420
我的評估很難！
I've got an appraisal with such difficulty!

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,580
但我得了5分！
I got scored 5 out of 5 in my evaluation!

410
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,710
這就是我要說的，5分就是你工作的極限了 然後呢？ 你不會得到超過5分的分數
Thats what I am saying, 5 is the limit of your job. What after then? You won't score anything above 5.

411
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,600
你是否想要度過隻有5分的人生？
Do you want to get through life, only scoring 5 out of 5?

412
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,640
聽著，我給你解釋一下……
Listen, I will explain it to you...

413
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,320
你是什麼？
What are you?

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,210
你是什麼？
What are you?

415
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,340
我是什麼? 我是傑圖，已婚IT男，還有什麼？
What am I? I am Jitu, married and what else?

416
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,140
不! 不! 你是什麼？
No!!No!!1 What ARE you?

417
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,390
你是什麼？
What are you?

418
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,970
你瘋了嗎，納文？
Are you out of your mind , Naveen?

419
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,230
你是咖啡
You're Coffee.

420
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
什麼？
-What?

421
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,200
你是咖啡，混蛋
You're coffee, Motherf**ker.

422
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,940
你是咖啡..
You are coffee...

423
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,190
這個杯子是你的公司
And this cup is your company.

424
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
現在你以為你可以享受鑽進玻璃杯的樂趣……
Now you think you'lll have fun getting into the glass...

425
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
但是你不想離開咖啡杯
But you don't want to leave the cup.

426
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,030
現在如果你想流進玻璃杯裏，你必須先從咖啡杯裏出來
Now if you want to flow into the glass, you have to get out of the cup first.

427
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,370
等會……
Easy. Easy.

428
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,180
你到底想說什麼？
What do you want to say exactly?

429
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,520
我想說的是，一旦你出去了，你就可以進入這個玻璃杯..
All I'm saying is, once you're out, you can go into this glass...

430
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,460
你可以鑽進這個玻璃杯
You can get into this glass.

431
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
或者這個..
Or this...

432
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,310
現在你可能會想"這是個糖碗……
Now you might think, "This is a sugar bowl

433
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
但我是咖啡，我怎麼才能進去呢? ”
but I am coffee. How can I get inside this?"

434
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,500
不是嗎？
Won't you?

435
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,940
但你怎麼知道? 你是咖啡..
But how do YOU know? You're coffee...

436
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,720
老哥，你在幹什麼？
Dude, what are doing?

437
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,770
對不起，對不起，對不起..
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry...

438
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,990
你在幹什麼? 我的手機..
What are you doing dude? My phone...

439
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,720
如果是啤酒的話就會順利多了……
It happened so well, with a beer!

440
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,980
我想說的是..
So, what I was trying to say is...

441
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,570
不管你想說什麼，跟別人說去吧
Whatever you want to say, tell it to someone else

442
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,660
你辭掉了工作
You've left your job and let go

443
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,540
你以為你就是喬佈斯了嗎？
What do you think, you're Steve Jobs?

444
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,620
-我想說的是...-首先，自己先理清楚，你想做什麼..
What I was trying to say is... -First, figure it out for yourself, what you want to do...

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
然後我們再談
We'll then sit and talk it down

446
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,710
但是你要去哪裏呢？
But where are you going?

447
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,680
去買醋栗！
To buy gooseberry!

448
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,350
我明白..
I understood...

449
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,350
是的
Yeah.

450
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,130
那個混蛋有一天打電話給我說
The f**ker called me the other day and said

451
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,850
“為什麼總是拿人力資源團隊開玩笑？
"Why do keep joking about the H.R. team?

452
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,990
你知道做一個人力資源經理需要多少天賦嗎? ”
Do you know how much talent it takes, to be an H.R. manager?"

453
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,270
我說”先生
I said, "Sir

454
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,150
一天睡22個小時..
To sleep for 22 hours a day...

455
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,550
絕對需要很多天賦! ”
definitely takes a lot of talent!"

456
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,710
你的拉鏈開了！
Your fly's open!

457
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,950
他上當了！哈哈哈
He took the bait!

458
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,050
吸煙有害健康，你是公司非常重要的員工

459
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,810
傑圖 兄弟！
Jeetu bro!

460
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,370

00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,740

I was so glad, I took a selfie with a printout.

463
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,870
恭喜你！

464
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,450

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,670
你不請我抽支煙嗎？
Won't you offer me a cigarette?

468
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,810
但是這根快抽完了
But this one's almost done...

469
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,510
把剩下的都給我吧
Just give me whatever's left of it.

470
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,010
明天以後，我就再也見不到你了！

你告訴你妻子了嗎？
Did you tell your wife about it?

474
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,880
還冇有，我回家後會告訴她的！
Not yet. I'll tell her once I get home!

475
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,400

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
口香糖？

那晚你喝了多少酒？

我真的很抱歉，拉傑

發生那些事情
For whatever happened.

517
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,380
在巴西項目之後我真的很沮喪，所以我喝醉了，我..
After Brazil project, I was really upset, so I got drunk and I...

518
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,710
但無論如何，我認為離開這份工作是正確的決定
But anyway I think leaving the job was the right decision.

519
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,370
但我真誠地為我所說的話道歉
But I sincererly apologize for the things that I said.

520
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,820
顯然我不是那個意思
Obviously I didn't mean any of that.

521
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,620
冇關係的，這件事……
It's OK!!! It happens...

我們已經一起工作了三年了，冇關係! ! ！

我帶來了辭呈

526
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,340
我隻是想..

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,680
這樣正式一些……
Officialy, I would...

Infact, there's a 99% chance, that it's going to... get selected

532
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,220
所以我隻能祈禱了
So I am just keeping my fingers crossed.

533
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,250
哇! 裸辭創業！
Wow! Full time start-up, then!

534
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,950
哇
Wow

535
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,910
那麼你可能會考慮過……
Then you may have thought about the...

536
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,850
天使投資者的流動性偏好
The liquidity preferences of the Angel Investors.

537
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,600
是嗎？
Yeah?

538
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,440
你一定也考慮過員工持股計劃的分配吧
You must've also thought about the ESOP pool allocation?

539
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,020
對吧？
Right?

540
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,320
不，還冇有
No. Not exactly!!!

541
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,060
但我相信，隨著時間的推移，我們都會考慮到
But I am sure with time we will get into it.

542
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,110

Ohh, of course! I've read a lot, about him. Really?

546
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,310
當然! 當然! 你是企業家
Of course! Of course! You're the entrepreneur.

547
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,740
他就是這樣開始的... 創業

552
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,590
你聽說過 Harshit Kothari 嗎？

554
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
哈斯特？

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,320
冇聽過嗎？
No?

556
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,860
冇有
No...

557
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,060
不管怎樣，他也是從這樣的創業開始的
Anyway, even he began with the start-up like this

558
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,040
項目叫什麼來著..
What was it's name again...

559
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
不記得了，總之……

560
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,410
不幸的是... ... 想法很好，但效果不太好
Unfortunately... It was a good idea, but it didn't do so well.

561
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,770
冇過幾年，他必須回來..

回到他的工作崗位

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,590
你都聽說過嗎？
Have you heard about them all?

568
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,310
索拉佈 · 法希
Saurabh Vahi...

569
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,820
冇聽過
I don't think so.

570
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,200
當然，你現在可是大人物了！
Of course. You're in the big league now!

571
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,870
你將會贏得一場聲望很高的比賽！
You're going to win a prestigious competition!

572
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,480
這個比賽每年都舉行嗎？
Is this competition held every year?

573
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,180
是啊，已經舉辦了7-8年了
Yeah, it's been happening for the last 7-8 years now.

574
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,410
哇! 7-8年了！
Wow! 7-8 years!

575
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,660
那麼，之前的獲獎者中有多少人已經成功了呢？
So how many of the previous winners have made it big?

576
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,410
以前的贏家! ! ！
Previous winners!!!

577
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,120
其實我也不知道
I don't know actually.

578
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,390
每當這個國家的畢業生厭倦了朝九晚五的工作..
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

579
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,330
所以，為了擺脫睏境，他們隻有三個選擇
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

580
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,190
讀MBA
MBA

581
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
讀IAS
IAS

582
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,150
或者去創業
or Start-Up.

583
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,030
出去看看，納文
Go out and take a look, Naveen.

584
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,380
創業公司的創始人們坐在三個小屋中的兩個裏麵
There are start-up founders sitting in 2 out of 3 cabins, out there.

585
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,770
納文..
Naveen...

586
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,350
你真的認為你的想法是百萬分之一嗎？
Do you really think your idea is one in a million?

587
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,960
聽著
Look!

588
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,470
你認為這是你所嚮往的……
You think this is your passion...

589
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,810
這就是為什麼，你要離開這份工作
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

590
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,570
這就是為什麼，你要離開這份工作
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

591
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,420
但這不是…… 納文
But, this is not your passion, Naveen.

592
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,310
如果真的是這樣，那麼很久之前……
If this was your passion, then you would've left this job...

593
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,210
就辭職了
A long time back.

594
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,210
你不會等著被巴西項目拒絕
You wouldn't have waited for being rejected from the Brazil project.

595
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,810
不..
No...

596
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,840
不... 我不這樣認為
No...I don't

597
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
我覺得..
I think....

598
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
北京
Beijing.

599
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,550
我們準備開始在那裏擴張，比原計劃提前了6個月
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

600
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,520
一周內有個會議
Apointment within a week.

601
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,020
我們需要一個聰明人
We need someone smart over there...

602
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,180
像你一樣
Like you.

603
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,990
你要在20分鍾內……
You have to leave for your... Visa appointment, in Delhi in...

604
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,070
去德裏辦簽證
The next 20 mins.

605
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,750
那天晚上你打電話給我
That night when you called me.

606
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,890
你並冇有做出選擇
You did not make a choice.

607
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,800
你隻是錶現出拒絕
You were simply reacting to a rejection.

608
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,330
現在才是真正的選擇
Now is the real choice.

609
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,910
想想吧，納文
Think about it, Naveen.

610
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,370
已經得到的一定比不確定的更好
One in hand is obviously better than one not-so-sure in the bush.

611
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,120
不是嗎？
No?

612
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,750
傑圖：創業帶我一個，8點酒吧見麵？

613
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,870
尤吉：喲！你今天要喝啤酒

614
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,170
納文
Naveen

615
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,320
在我的浴室裏
In my bathroom.

616
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,090
你讓我不要用你的衛生間，我怎麼用？
How will I use your bathroom, after you've asked me not to?

617
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,650
什麼事？
Yeah, tell me?

618
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,820
真是奇怪啊
How strange is this?

619
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,300
納文冇有升職，所以辭職了
Naveen didn't get promoted, so he quit his job.

620
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,310
現在你卻想在升職後辭職
And now you're thinking of quitting, after you've been promoted.

621
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,060
人類的大腦是個謎，夥計
Human brain is a mystery, bud.

622
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,430
你想點些什麼嗎？
-You wanna order something?

623
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,060
你想點什麼？
What do you want to order?

624
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,030
我們來吃冷玉米吧
Let's do chilly babycorn.

625
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,200
“每公斤1000盧比! ”
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

626
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,630
“每公斤1000盧比! ”
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

627
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,540
計劃辭職的人，不要吃玉米粒！
People planning to quit their job, don't eat babycorn!

628
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,490
夥計，我聽說會有大筆資金流入，好嗎？
Dude, I was told there's going to be an influx of money, ok?

629
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,670
要發工資了，我要訂購嬰兒玉米！
I'm going to get a salary and hence, I'm ordering babycorn!

630
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,000
我們也給納文點點東西吧
-Let's order something for Naveen too.

631
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,040
是的，他一定在路上了
Yeah, he must be on his way.

632
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
是的，他一定在路上了
Yeah, he must be on his way.

633
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,220
納文來不了了
Naveen's not going to be able to make it.

634
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,280
曼達爾？
-Mandal?

635
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,430
他在哪兒？
Where is he?

636
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,920
事實上..
Actually...

637
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,540
是他讓我來這兒的
He's the one who requested me to come here.

638
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,970
他..
He...

639
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,770
不得不馬上離開
... had to leave urgently.

640
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,390
去哪裏？
But where?

641
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,530
請去機場
Airport please.

642
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,200
這對他來說是一個非常艱難的決定
It was a very tough decision for him.

643
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,620
他很傷心
He was very sad.

644
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,610
還哭了
He waas even crying.

645
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,240
你說真的? 他哭了？
Are you serious? He was crying?

646
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,460
我是說，電話裏聽不出來吧
I mean, you can't really tell on the phone, can you?

647
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,320
但是他的聲音..
But his voice...

648
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
聽起來很沈重
... sounded heavy.

649
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,880
但他為什麼不打電話給我們？
But why didn't he call us?

650
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,150
他很匆忙，所以打電話給他最好的朋友
He was in a hurry. So called up his best friend.

651
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,160
麵對你們他一定很難過
He must be feeling really bad about facing you guys.

652
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,510
他一定感到很內疚
He must be feeling very guilty.

653
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,270
你能開快一點嗎？
Could you please drive a little faster?

654
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,050
否則，我就要錯過我的航班了！
Or else, I'm going to miss my flight!

655
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,540
先生，你看這裏的交通有多堵！
Sir, you see how there's so much traffic here!

656
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,250
還有另外一條路可以通過昌迪瓦利
There's this one other way via Chandivali

657
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,360
我們要走那邊嗎？
Should we try that?

658
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,600
我們要走那邊嗎？
Should we try that?

659
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,240
能準時到達機場嗎？
Will it get us to the airport on time?

660
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,710
那裏不會堵車吧？
There won't be any traffic there?

661
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,340
我們可以去碰碰運氣
We can find that out, only once, we take that road.

662
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,090
但是如果我們堵在這裏
But if we stay stuck here, in this traffic...

663
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,090
那肯定是趕不上飛機了！
Then you'll definitely miss your flight!

664
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,570
好吧，那我們就走你說的路
Alright then, let's try that one, then.

665
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,240
他不接電話
He's not answering his phone.

666
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,440
他不會接的
He won't.

667
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
他現在肯定已經登記入住了
He must've even checked in, by now.

668
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,520
你可以在他從德裏回來後的第二天和他談談
You can talk to him, when he gets back from Delhi, day after.

669
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,530
來吧，開心點，夥計們！
Come on, cheer up guys!

670
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,910
相信我，他愛你
Trust me. He loves you.

671
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,390
他總是跟我提起你們倆
He always spoke to me about the two of you.

672
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,490
打擾一下! 我們的酒杯呢？
Excuse me! Our pitcher?

673
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
喝吧，夥計們！
Drink guys!

674
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,450
尤吉，你已經辭職了，這不是個問題嗎？
Yogi, you've quit your job. Isn't that going to be a problem now?

675
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,900
我明天就回去
I'll go back tommorow.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,980
我會告訴他們今天是荷爾蒙作祟
I'll tell them, I went through some hormonal problem!

677
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,510
我以前也這麼做過
I have done this before.

678
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,890
你的手機呢? 灑進咖啡了，對吧？
What about your phone? It got spilled on, with coffee, didn't it?

679
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,320
別提電話了，他燙傷了我的腿
Forget the phone. He burned my leg.

680
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,140
都燙紅了
It's become all red!

681
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,560
還要瞞著桑亞塗藥膏！
Have to keep applying burnol, without letting Soumya know about it!

682
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,670
讓我用啤酒再給你們講一遍
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

683
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,760
它不會燙傷你，隻會灑出來
It won't burn, even if it spills.

684
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,370
你回來了！
You're back!!!

685
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,070
我就知道你會來的！
I knew it, you'd come!

686
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,530
這個混蛋一直說得好像你已經死了一樣！
This motherf**ker's been talking as if you've died!

687
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,440
你錯過了航班？
You missed your flight?

688
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,220
冇有錯過，離開了！
Didn't miss it. Left it!

689
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,500
為什麼? 機場冇有酒吧嗎？
Why? Aren't there any bars at the airport?

690
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,290
你以為我會為了啤酒放棄去北京嗎？
You think I let go off Beijing for beer?

691
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,580
我回來是為了創業
I came back for the start-up.

692
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,180
別擔心，坐下
Don't worry. Sit down.

693
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,120
服務員，再來一杯
Waiter, one more glass please.

694
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,080
納文怎麼了？
What'd happened Naveen?

695
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,860
拉傑問我是否確定，我們的想法是“百萬分之一” ？
Rajat asked me if I was sure, that our idea is "one in a million"?

696
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,910
隻是我不確定
It's just that, I wasn't sure.

697
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,680
你現在確定了？
So you're sure, now?

698
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,110
不，現在還不確定
No, not sure even now.

699
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,020
但是後來我想，如果我們辭掉工作去嘗試，我們可能會成功，也可能不會
But then I thought, if we quit our jobs and try, we might succeed, or we might not.

700
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,250
但是如果我們不嘗試，那麼我們肯定不會成功
But if we don't try, then we'll definitely not succeed.

701
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,240
所以基本上，這個故事的寓意是..
So basically, the moral of the story is...

702
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,430
我們都是啤酒，混蛋！
We're all beers, motherf**kers!

703
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,430
好了，是時候保護你的手機了！
OK, time to safeguard your phones!

704
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
讓我們先幹杯
Lets bottoms up first.

705
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,210
但是冇有玻璃杯，尤吉！
But I don't have a glass, Yogi!

706
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,700
- 拿著這個-那你呢？
-Take this one. -And what about you?

707
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,460
我用這個喝
I'll drink from the pitcher!

708
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
幹杯! 幹杯！
Cheers! Cheers!

709
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,160
等我一下，夥計們
Give me a second guys.

710
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,130
所以你明天就辭職？
- So you're quitting your job tomorow?

711
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,030
是的，怎麼樣了？
Yes Chatty, tell me?

712
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,110
不一定是明天，因為我還要和桑亞商量一下！
Not really tomorrow, becasue I still have to discuss it with Soumya!

713
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,220
你為什麼要結婚？
Why would you get married, dude?

714
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,060
又冇有人逼你結婚，難道是為了啪啪啪？
It's not cumpolsory, to get arrange married, for sex?

715
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,120
尤吉，不是的
Yogi, it's not really for sex

716
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,390
桑亞是一個很好的人！
Soumya's also a very good person!

717
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,340
發生了什麼？
What happened?

718
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,640
八卦剛打電話來
Chatty just called.

719
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,050
阿克希爾給我坑了
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

720
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,690
我們的名字不在獲勝者名單上！
Our name's not on the winner's list!

721
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,040
我就知道！
I knew it!

722
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,550
四號酒店的家夥是一群混蛋
Hostel 4 guys are the biggest douchebags!!!

723
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,370
狗娘養的整晚都在吃麵包
Motherf**kers ate bread savouries all night long

724
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,820
然後把他們的賬單加到我的食堂賬戶上！
And then added their bills to my canteen account!

725
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,580
我恨死四號酒店的人了！
I hate hostel 4 guys.

726
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:42,680
但是等等..
But wait...

727
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,380
現在我的薪水怎麼辦？
What about my salary now?
