1
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:38,210
Thank you, Sir.

2
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,920
Thank you, so much.

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,920
Sir, great job at BuyEasy... Fantastic you are

4
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,360
Thank you.

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,690
And sir, congratulations for your second round investment too.

6
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually sir, I work for an e-commerce website...

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,490
...and I am a category manager there and I...

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,090
You can upload your resume on career section on our website.

9
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,230
Sir, can I show you my work sometime... -OK, bye.

10
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,390
Please sir... Give me one chance, sir.

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,770
Guys like these, don't even let you drink at your own party.

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,020
Bhati, how much did you get for 20%, 50?

13
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,290
It will be out in Sunday's Business Outlook... Take a look yourself!

14
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,780
Bhati, tell me, 60?

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,480
It's official, I can't reveal it now.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,090
How much, 75?

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,880
Now don't tell me it's 100.

18
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,700
F**K!!!

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,580
100?

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,130
A hundred million?

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,150
Bhati, your company's evaluation is half a billion dollars?

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,380
F**K!!!

23
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,880
So what's the big deal?

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,200
It's still lesser than Flipkart by 7.5 billion.

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,630
Bhati, it means one of my college seniors is going to be a billionaire!

26
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,110
F**K, what luck!

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,400
It's not about fate or luck...

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:42,650
IIM?

29
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,930
LSR. IIM.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,330
I should have appeared for CAT.

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,060
All you do, is keep harping about my luck.

32
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,560
You've told me about your start-up idea over a 100 times now.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,780
Why don't you do something about it?

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,900
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here.

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,200
And you are still selling these cheap chinese phones on Mokart.

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,080
They're exculsive, Bhati. -Bullshit.

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
Son, its not that easy.

38
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,170
Leave your job and venture into the market.

39
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,630
And then you will learn, what destinies are made of and from.

40
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,000
Dude, what the f**k? Still on your first beer?

41
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,350
Down it!

42
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm good, Bhati.

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:18,900
Beer for him.

44
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,070
Beer for him.

45
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,730
Bhati, I have to wake up early at 8:30 for work.

46
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,450
Shut up!!!

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,120
Bhati, I've become very discipled now.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,440
Nowadays I don't even need an alarm to wake up..

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,360
Not going to the office?

50
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,390
What are you doing here?

51
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,730
I switched on the geyser

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
The water's still heating up.

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,760
Mandal why do you take a bath in my bathroom?

54
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,860
The handle of my bucket is broken.

55
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,810
So, take my bucket to your bathroom.

56
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
Actually, I feel like taking a shower today.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,770
Dude, you can take a shower even in your own bathroom.

58
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
The water must've heated up!

59
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,780
Atleast spare my towel.

60
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,060
Mokart f**ked me over Bhati. Completely f**ked me.

61
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,260
I put in so much effort into this Brazil project.

62
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,400
Worked even on Sundays.

63
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,310
I made atleast a 1000 PPTs.

64
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
Must've made more than 5000 excel sheets.

65
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,650
And when it came down to leading the team, instead of me, they sent someone else to Rio.

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Bhati, I will take revenge!

67
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,340
I will take revenge for sure!

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
I will even avenge them, Bhati.

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,630
Once I get the funding

70
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,290
I'll make so much money Bhati... So much money

71
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,290
I'll buy Mokart and...

72
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,910
And sell it on OLX, f**king shit.

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,980
But how, Bhati?

74
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,360
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

75
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,740
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

76
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,300
What are you?

77
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,580
What do you mean, what am I?

78
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,160
What are you?

79
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,460
I am the Executive Regional Manager, Navin Bansal, Mokart.com

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,900
No, what are YOU?

81
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,290
Executive regional manager... -You are a beer.

82
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,720
What do you mean?

83
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,840
You're beer, motherf**ker.

84
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,810
You're beer.

85
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,520
And this bottle here? This is your company

86
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,020
You think, you'll get into the glass.

87
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,990
You will have fun.

88
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,860
Isn't it?

89
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,910
But look at this.

90
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,520
Can you see?

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,470
You actually don't want to leave the bottle.

92
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,520
For the beer to get into the glass... It needs to leave the bottle first

93
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,470
Once you're out of the bottle

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,600
Then you can get into any glass you want.

95
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,490
In this glass, if you want.

96
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,990
Or you can get into this glass

97
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,540
Even in this glass. -Its a wine glass.

98
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,960
How the hell do YOU know that?

99
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,590
You are beer.

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,130
Get it?

101
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,500
You can go wherever you want.

102
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,810
Understand?

103
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,440
But it's quintissential you come out of the bottle, first.

104
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,510
Once you are out, you could fill half the glass

105
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,700
Or maybe you won't.

106
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,030
But if you don't come out

107
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,710
Then you'll definitely not be able to fill it. Look here.

108
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,450
And its not your job to ask the questions.

109
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,690
You're beer.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,010
And your job is to flow.

111
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,020
You are beer.

112
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,270
This is beer.

113
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,390
Not glass.

114
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,770
Infact there is no glass.

115
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,550
But there is a glass on the table, Bhati.

116
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
No glass.

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
I am a beer, Bhati.

118
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,900
I am beer.

119
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,160
And I'll get out of the bottle.

120
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
I will get out of the bottle...

121
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,950
Will you have breakfast?

122
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,380
Yes

123
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,620
What do you want to eat?

124
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,760
Bread Omlett.

125
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,200
We've no eggs left.

126
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,630
Bread Jam.

127
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,580
Which one, mixed fruit or mango?

128
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,640
Mixed fruit.

129
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,910
The mixed fruit one, got done with, last week itself!

130
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,640
Mango then!

131
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,330
We didn't get any mango in the first place!

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
Just toast the bread for me.

133
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,790
The toaster's been broken for such a long time, now!

134
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,340
Dude, one cup tea will do.

135
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,930
But I already used all the milk for the curd!

136
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,830
So what are you eating, then?

137
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,860
Curd.

138
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,340
I don't want any breakfast today. I'll have directly skip to lunch!

139
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,840
What?

140
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,070
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

141
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,660
Your 'battery' will start seeping. Your mom.... -Dude, please leave me alone.

142
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,700
What? -Bhati... You were right!

143
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,510
What?

144
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,570
I'm beer, Bhati.

145
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,620
And I will flow out of the bottle.

146
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,630
I will resign.

147
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,380
I will resign.

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,930
This decision will change your life.

149
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,310
Come on, lets drink.

150
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,960
One beer for him.

151
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,980
Bhati listen, Bhati.

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,030
First listen to me

153
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,260
This decision that you're taking now

154
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,140
Will change your future.

155
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
You know what I mean.

156
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,930
No!! No!! No!! You didn't get me.

157
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,640
I will resign right now.

158
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,260
I will call him right now.

159
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,340
-Have you gone mad? -I will resign right now, I don't give a F**K.

160
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,650
-Listen to me. -I will call him right now.

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
-Listen to me.

162
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,440
Bhati, I am beer Bhati, let me flow.

163
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,750
Bro, don't flow so much!

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,430
Listen to me, just listen.

165
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,910
You have to serve the notice period.

166
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,200
Do you think, I'm scared?

167
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,810
Am I a coward?

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,450
When did I say that...

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
I will show it to you. I will prove it to you.

170
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,970
I will show it to you, right now. -Navin. Listen, listen. This a very odd hour, right now.

171
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,420
You think I can't get out of the bottle? I am a beer and I will flow...

172
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,710
Rajat?

173
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,180
Rajat, I am so sorry that I am calling you this hour.

174
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,020
There's something very important, I want to tell you!

175
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,140
Rajat you're an a**hole!!!

176
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,710
And your department

177
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,270
Infact your whole company, is an a**hole.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,970
So you and your company are fired from my life.

179
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,610
Good night, Jai Hind.

180
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
And F**K you.

181
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,270
F**K YOU!!!

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,390
That's my drink!!!

183
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,740
Sorry...

184
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,080
Really? Are you from IIM?

185
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,280
Whose this?

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,570
Yaa Chatty, tell me

187
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,550
But NasCom conclave's result where supposed to be out next week, weren't they?

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720
Akhil, who?

189
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,740
Ohh the hostel 4 guy.

190
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,870
Is he in Nascom?

191
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,250
OK.

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,700
So..What did he say?

193
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,220
You've got to be kidding me!

194
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,470
Are you sure?

195
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,520
Confirmed?

196
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,230
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

197
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,410
F**K!!!

198
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,280
What luck!

199
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,480
Are you sure?

200
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,100
Thanks, thanks, thanks dude...

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,970
Ok then, I'll tell the others as well

202
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,890
No, no.. Let it get official first. I'll update my status after!

203
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,090
OK.

204
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,620
I'll talk to you in the evening, alright?

205
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,430
Ok. Take care. Bye.

206
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,480
Naveen

207
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,220
You are so irresponsible man.

208
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,660
This was lying behind your commode.

209
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,000
What do I do with it?

210
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,070
Now do one thing Mandal.

211
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,020
This? Throw it into the garbage!

212
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,760
He called me in the office and started yelling at me!

213
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,030
I said, "Sir

214
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,170
..if you have so much problem with me sleeping..

215
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,440
..then tranfer me to HR department..

216
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,220
They even get an extra bonus for sleeping, there"

217
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,940
Jeetu bro!

218
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,570
Jeetu bro!

219
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,930
Congrats...

220
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,210
Do you have an extra?

221
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,080
No, it's the last one.

222
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,530
No issue. Blow it on my face.

223
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,510
Passive will also do!

224
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,620
Congrats for what?

225
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,370
Now don't pretend!

226
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,410
You were amazing in the appraisal!

227
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,700
By the way, did you watch last night's Nach Baliye??

228
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,760
Chetan bhagat was awesome. He just..

229
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,000
How did you get to know about it?

230
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,520
Saw it last night. The 9pm show.

231
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,380
And then again, the 11:30 repeat telecast.

232
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,180
No, I mean about the appraisal. How do you know about that?

233
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,390
Appraisal ? Ohh!!!

234
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,700
Joshi sir showed it to us.

235
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,260
Even the 'Acheivement box' wasn't big enough.

236
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,980
Though I didn't really get one thing!

237
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,670
Why did you gave yourself 4 out of 5 in the self evaluation?

238
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,780
I knew it! I should've given myself 3.5...

239
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,570
3.5?

240
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,120
You should've given yourself 5 out of 5.

241
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,600
What more could you possibly do?

242
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,720
No tell me, what more can you do?

243
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,000
Jeetu, can I tell you something?

244
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,510
Whenever we get a code written by you

245
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,380
We forward it, without even testing it

246
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,050
Why waste time, by running it?

247
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,910
And Joshi sir keeps praising you always.

248
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:44,940
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

249
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,700
Oh, Divya from the marketing team?

250
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,560
It's her engagement today.

251
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,100
Will you come?

252
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,070
What was Joshi sir saying?

253
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,280
Joshi sir said, he will come!

254
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,130
Actually what happened was...

255
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,620
No!!! No!! I meant what was Joshi sir saying about me?

256
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,130
You said something...

257
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,050
Ohh

258
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,000
Not only Joshi sir

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,050
But the whole department says this.

260
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,540
But the whole department says this.

261
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,620
"Whether or not someone else does... you are defintely getting promoted"

262
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,110
And there's no two ways about it.

263
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,680
OK!!! I should be going, I have work to do.

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,720
Take a chewing gum.

265
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,080
-No!!! No!! -Its mint flavoured.

266
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,110
No, no.. You can have it.

267
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,130
Ok!!! I will also leave after a couple of hours, I have to rest.

268
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Too much work to do...

269
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,760
And remember the mithaee kachori for tommorow!

270
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,800
And greetings to your wife.

271
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,200
Dude, did you see that guy?

272
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,950
Amazing

273
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,820
Just a second... Pass me the cigarette

274
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,840
Sir, the staff has requested the lunch time to be extended from 15 minutes to half an hour.

275
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,580
Denied

276
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,400
Let them stay hungry and stay foolish. Next.

277
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,890
The laptops that were given to the TechSupport team are faulty.

278
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,010
The batteries drain out in half an hour!

279
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,730
Give them 10 of these and get them energized

280
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Sir, but they need to charge their laptops. not phones.

281
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,710
Well then tell the f**king tech support to help tech support, in all the matters of tech support. Next.

282
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,850
Sir, marketing research report.

283
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,540
Don't give numbers, give me graphs and pie charts.

284
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,620
You!!

285
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,570
Give me the graphs on this by tommorow.

286
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,920
But I am from Legal.

287
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,090
Objection Overruled.

288
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,500
Next.

289
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,660
Sir, all the new sales interns are waiting for their induction

290
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,350
Assemble them in conference room.

291
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,760
But sir, the AC in that room is not working. It's very hot in there.

292
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,070
Good, it's the first day they need to feel the heat.

293
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,320
Sir, but what about your hair loss appointment?

294
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,290
Let's give a big round of applause for chacha.

295
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,270
So, you guys are the company's future sales team.

296
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,080
And you guys will be dealing with the client directly.

297
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,040
-Are you guys excited? -Yes sir.

298
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,720
OK!!!

299
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,000
So guys, let me tell you.

300
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,000
Impressing your client is like impressing a girl

301
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,370
that every man in the town is after.

302
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,870
And this girl, doesn't even want to meet you.

303
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,100
Doesn't want to pick up your calls.

304
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,010
Infact, she doesn't even know you.

305
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,050
She f**king hates you.

306
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,040
Now, what will you do to impress such a girl?

307
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,070
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

308
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,480
Sir, I will threaten to slit my wrists, sir.

309
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,170
Yeah, maybe, as a last resort to meet the targets.

310
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,770
But, what will you begin with?

311
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,290
You will never give up!!!

312
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,120
You will never quit!!!

313
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,630
You have to treat your client, like your girlfriend.

314
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,530
Show them your loyalty.

315
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,090
Take them out for coffee.

316
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,170
Call them thrice a day.

317
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,370
Remember their birthdays.

318
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,200
In fact, fantasize about your client every night.

319
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,020
I do sir. EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.

320
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,200
OK!!! Excellent.

321
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,600
Anyways..

322
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,580
Guys remember.

323
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,650
Whatever happens..

324
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,990
Whatever the situation may be.

325
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,140
Just like me...

326
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,420
You should never quit.

327
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,950
Can I hear that aloud? You should... -never quit.

328
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,130
You should... -never quit.

329
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,780
You should... -never quit.

330
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,090
You should... -never quit

331
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,080
方案B有戏，我辞职了，五点见

332
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,090
You should... -never quit

333
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,000
方案B有戏，我辞职了，五点见

334
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,010
You should... -never quit

335
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,430
You should... -never quit

336
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Guys!!!

337
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
I quit!!!

338
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
You should...

339
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,550
But the news is confirmed, isn't it?

340
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,670
Yaa, Akhil works at NasCom itself. He was in hostel 4

341
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,240
Hostel 4 guys are very nice. Very helpful.

342
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,820
Last year, when I slapped Ruchi's father

343
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,070
Hostel 4's G.sec bailed me out.

344
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,630
No, no. I bought it already.

345
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,630
I've bought babycorn as well.

346
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
Hey Jitu.

347
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
yaa, yaa...

348
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,820
No, I still didn't get any gooseberry.

349
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,200
Yaa, I will look for them...

350
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,360
I'll be home in an hour. OK?

351
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,230
OK!!! OK!!!

352
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
OK!!! OK!!!

353
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,330
Dude, vegetables are SO expensive!!!

354
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,700
Do you know how much babycorn costs?

355
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,780
100 gram for 100 Rupees. 1000 per KG.

356
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,510
We need money in life, dude! What do people keep going on about, real estate being expensive in Bombay?

357
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,490
Jitu I quit the job. -Don't eat the apple dude. They put a sticker of 30 on it but sell it for 50...

358
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,560
What did you leave? What are you saying?

359
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,270
I quit my job, last night.

360
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,310
Why?

361
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,900
-And Brazil?

362
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,370
-They are sending someone else.

363
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,570
What now?

364
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,480
New job? What?

365
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,460
No dude, our idea is going to get selected in the conclave.

366
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,210
Now let's just begin with the start-up

367
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,340
We've only been talking about it since 3rd year. -Naveen we've already discussed this.

368
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,490
What did we discuss?

369
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,810
That by the time you come back from Brazil, after a

370
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,470
year and a half, Yogi will make some contacts here.

371
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,170
But that we can do... -And even I have to settle down with Somya.

372
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,950
Guys try to understand, I can't leave my job right now.

373
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,110
There's finally something good happening for me in the company

374
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,500
People are realizing my potential.

375
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,300
I’m a valuable employee to the company.

376
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,470
Won't be able to leave the job. - Listen to me.

377
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,880
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here!

378
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
And you're still writing codes on Python.

379
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,810
This the the opportunity. This is the time. We should start now.

380
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,590
And don't worry at all dude.

381
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,030
Once we get the funding, we'll ensure, you get your salary even if we work for free.

382
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,090
Jitu, all the core work is tech related.

383
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,820
Jitu, all the core work is tech related.

384
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,050
How will we manage without you?

385
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,170
All he's trying to say is, if we want to be the 'stud' enterpreneurs

386
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,420
and want our company to be as big as Apple...

387
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,860
Then he needs to be Steve Jobs

388
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,280
You need to be Steve Wozniak

389
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,710
and I need to be a Sean Parker.

390
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,700
Sean Parker's from Facebook.

391
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,950
Yaa, we'll leave our jobs and become entrepreneurs.

392
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,520
Can you even spell entrepreneurship?

393
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:19,920
E

394
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,570
E

395
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,410
N

396
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,030
T...

397
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,870
To be an entrepreneur, you don't need the spelling but the spirit.

398
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,390
Naveen, its now that finally something good's happening in my life!

399
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,420
I've got an appraisal with such difficulty!

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,580
I got scored 5 out of 5 in my evaluation!

401
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,710
Thats what I am saying, 5 is the limit of your job. What after then? You won't score anything above 5.

402
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,600
Do you want to get through life, only scoring 5 out of 5?

403
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,640
Listen, I will explain it to you...

404
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,320
What are you?

405
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,210
What are you?

406
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,340
What am I? I am Jitu, married and what else?

407
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,140
No!!No!!1 What ARE you?

408
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,390
What are you?

409
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,970
Are you out of your mind , Naveen?

410
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,230
You're Coffee.

411
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
-What?

412
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,200
You're coffee, Motherf**ker.

413
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,940
You are coffee...

414
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,190
And this cup is your company.

415
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
Now you think you'lll have fun getting into the glass...

416
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
But you don't want to leave the cup.

417
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,030
Now if you want to flow into the glass, you have to get out of the cup first.

418
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,370
Easy. Easy.

419
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,180
What do you want to say exactly?

420
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,520
All I'm saying is, once you're out, you can go into this glass...

421
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,460
You can get into this glass.

422
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
Or this...

423
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,310
Now you might think, "This is a sugar bowl

424
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
but I am coffee. How can I get inside this?"

425
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,500
Won't you?

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,940
But how do YOU know? You're coffee...

427
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,720
Dude, what are doing?

428
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,770
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry...

429
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,990
What are you doing dude? My phone...

430
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,720
It happened so well, with a beer!

431
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,980
So, what I was trying to say is...

432
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,570
Whatever you want to say, tell it to someone else

433
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,660
You've left your job and let go

434
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,540
What do you think, you're Steve Jobs?

435
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,620
What I was trying to say is... -First, figure it out for yourself, what you want to do...

436
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
We'll then sit and talk it down

437
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,710
But where are you going?

438
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,680
To buy gooseberry!

439
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,350
I understood...

440
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,350
Yeah.

441
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,130
The f**ker called me the other day and said

442
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,850
"Why do keep joking about the H.R. team?

443
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,990
Do you know how much talent it takes, to be an H.R. manager?"

444
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,270
I said, "Sir

445
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,150
To sleep for 22 hours a day...

446
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,550
definitely takes a lot of talent!"

447
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,710
Your fly's open!

448
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,950
He took the bait!

449
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,810
Jeetu bro!

450
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,370
Jeetu bro!

451
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,820
Congratulations! Congratulations!

452
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,740
I was so glad, I took a selfie with a printout.

453
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,870
Kudos!

454
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,450
So...

455
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,550
Mr. Jitendra Maheshwari!

456
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,260
Mr. Senior Developer!

457
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,670
Won't you offer me a cigarette?

458
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,810
But this one's almost done...

459
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,510
Just give me whatever's left of it.

460
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,010
Tomorrow onwards, I won't be able to even see you!

461
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,040
A big position!

462
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,500
A big salary! The works!

463
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,410
Did you tell your wife about it?

464
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,880
Not yet. I'll tell her once I get home!

465
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Ahaan!

466
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,730
Someone's gonna get lucky tonight!!!

467
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Jeetu bro...

468
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,500
Can I tell you something?

469
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,410
Amazing job!

470
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,370
Your life's now absolutely set!

471
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,070
Within the next 5 years, you'll be

472
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,800
Principal Developer

473
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:37,870
Then within the next 10 years

474
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,700
Associate Divsion Head

475
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,000
And 15 years down, I'm sure, you'd have replaced Joshi Sir!

476
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,990
Joshi Sir!!!

477
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,810
I was just praising you!

478
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
No, genuinely!

479
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,080
Joshi Sir.

480
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,410
Will you have a chewing gum?

481
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Chewing gum?

482
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,170
No. I've to go back. I've work to do.

483
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,920
I brought the 'Advance mint' flavoured ones, especially for you.

484
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,990
Mint or advance mint. I just told you, I don't want any!

485
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,630
I'll take a leave. I've work to do!

486
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,590
Alright then. Anyway, new work starts today for you!

487
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,680
Let's meet at Pandeji's stall in the evening for some mithaee kachori.

488
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:20,990
6 PM!

489
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,670
Ok!!! I'll let you know...

490
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,030
Don't think about it! It's final, OK?

491
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,160
What's up?

492
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
I just got back, these PR guys really suck the life out of you!

493
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,700
Rajat, can I come in?

494
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,740
How would I know, it'll take till 7?

495
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:56,870
Rajesh!

496
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,590
OK.. I'll... I'll be there, I'll be there. Just give me a couple of minutes.

497
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,980
OK?

498
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,630
Bye.

499
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
So, Naveen.

500
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,810
How many drink did you have that night?

501
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,260
I am really sorry, Rajat.

502
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,580
I'm... I'm really embarassed about it.

503
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,940
For whatever happened.

504
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,380
After Brazil project, I was really upset, so I got drunk and I...

505
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,710
But anyway I think leaving the job was the right decision.

506
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,370
But I sincererly apologize for the things that I said.

507
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,820
Obviously I didn't mean any of that.

508
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,620
It's OK!!! It happens...

509
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,950
We've been working together for three years now. It's OK!!!

510
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,120
Don't stress more. Chill

511
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,000
Thank you.

512
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,550
I brought my resignation.

513
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,340
I just thought...

514
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,680
Officialy, I would...

515
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,560
What next, then?

516
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:48,180
Just that. Want to do a start-up, Rajat.

517
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,530
Our B-Plan is in the final round of the NasCom Conclave

518
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,840
Infact, there's a 99% chance, that it's going to... get selected

519
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,220
So I am just keeping my fingers crossed.

520
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,250
Wow! Full time start-up, then!

521
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:58,950
Wow

522
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,910
Then you may have thought about the...

523
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,850
The liquidity preferences of the Angel Investors.

524
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:05,600
Yeah?

525
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,440
You must've also thought about the ESOP pool allocation?

526
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,020
Right?

527
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,320
No. Not exactly!!!

528
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,060
But I am sure with time we will get into it.

529
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,110
You know Rahul Sharma was my batchmate in college.

530
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,270
Rahul Sharma!!!

531
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,440
The co-founder of Micromax.

532
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,680
Ohh, of course! I've read a lot, about him. Really?

533
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,310
Of course! Of course! You're the entrepreneur.

534
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,740
He'd started exactly like this... With a start-up

535
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,670
Look where he is today!

536
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,950
Last year his company was valued at...

537
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,320
...more then a billion dollars.

538
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Billion dollars, I know, I know.

539
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,590
Have you heard about Harshit Kothari?

540
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,180
He too, was my batchmate.

541
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
Harshit?

542
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,320
No?

543
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,860
No...

544
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,060
Anyway, even he began with the start-up like this

545
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,040
What was it's name again...

546
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Anyway!

547
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,410
Unfortunately... It was a good idea, but it didn't do so well.

548
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,770
He had to return...

549
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,920
To his job, in a couple of years.

550
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,530
There were many more, in my batch...

551
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,340
Manoj Agarwal... His brother, Vishal Agarwal

552
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,550
Saurabh Vahi, R.K. Paee...

553
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,910
Krishnamurthy

554
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,590
Have you heard about them all?

555
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,310
Saurabh Vahi...

556
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,820
I don't think so.

557
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,200
Of course. You're in the big league now!

558
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,870
You're going to win a prestigious competition!

559
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,480
Is this competition held every year?

560
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,180
Yeah, it's been happening for the last 7-8 years now.

561
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,410
Wow! 7-8 years!

562
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,660
So how many of the previous winners have made it big?

563
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,410
Previous winners!!!

564
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,120
I don't know actually.

565
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,390
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

566
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,330
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

567
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,190
MBA

568
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
IAS

569
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,150
or Start-Up.

570
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,030
Go out and take a look, Naveen.

571
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,380
There are start-up founders sitting in 2 out of 3 cabins, out there.

572
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,770
Naveen...

573
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,350
Do you really think your idea is one in a million?

574
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,960
Look!

575
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,470
You think this is your passion...

576
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,810
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

577
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,570
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

578
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,420
But, this is not your passion, Naveen.

579
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,310
If this was your passion, then you would've left this job...

580
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,210
A long time back.

581
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,210
You wouldn't have waited for being rejected from the Brazil project.

582
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,810
No...

583
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,840
No...I don't

584
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I think....

585
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Beijing.

586
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,550
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

587
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,520
Apointment within a week.

588
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,020
We need someone smart over there...

589
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,180
Like you.

590
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,990
You have to leave for your... Visa appointment, in Delhi in...

591
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,070
The next 20 mins.

592
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,750
That night when you called me.

593
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,890
You did not make a choice.

594
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,800
You were simply reacting to a rejection.

595
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,330
Now is the real choice.

596
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,910
Think about it, Naveen.

597
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,370
One in hand is obviously better than one not-so-sure in the bush.

598
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,120
No?

599
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,170
Naveen

600
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,320
In my bathroom.

601
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,090
How will I use your bathroom, after you've asked me not to?

602
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,650
Yeah, tell me?

603
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,820
How strange is this?

604
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,300
Naveen didn't get promoted, so he quit his job.

605
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,310
And now you're thinking of quitting, after you've been promoted.

606
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,060
Human brain is a mystery, bud.

607
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,430
-You wanna order something?

608
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,060
What do you want to order?

609
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,030
Let's do chilly babycorn.

610
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,200
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

611
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,630
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

612
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,540
People planning to quit their job, don't eat babycorn!

613
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,490
Dude, I was told there's going to be an influx of money, ok?

614
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,670
I'm going to get a salary and hence, I'm ordering babycorn!

615
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,000
-Let's order something for Naveen too.

616
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,040
Yeah, he must be on his way.

617
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
Yeah, he must be on his way.

618
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,220
Naveen's not going to be able to make it.

619
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,280
-Mandal?

620
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,430
Where is he?

621
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,920
Actually...

622
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,540
He's the one who requested me to come here.

623
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,970
He...

624
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,770
... had to leave urgently.

625
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,390
But where?

626
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,530
Airport please.

627
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,200
It was a very tough decision for him.

628
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,620
He was very sad.

629
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,610
He waas even crying.

630
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,240
Are you serious? He was crying?

631
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,460
I mean, you can't really tell on the phone, can you?

632
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,320
But his voice...

633
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
... sounded heavy.

634
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,880
But why didn't he call us?

635
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,150
He was in a hurry. So called up his best friend.

636
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,160
He must be feeling really bad about facing you guys.

637
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,510
He must be feeling very guilty.

638
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,270
Could you please drive a little faster?

639
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,050
Or else, I'm going to miss my flight!

640
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,540
Sir, you see how there's so much traffic here!

641
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,250
There's this one other way via Chandivali

642
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,360
Should we try that?

643
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,600
Should we try that?

644
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,240
Will it get us to the airport on time?

645
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,710
There won't be any traffic there?

646
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,340
We can find that out, only once, we take that road.

647
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,090
But if we stay stuck here, in this traffic...

648
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,090
Then you'll definitely miss your flight!

649
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,570
Alright then, let's try that one, then.

650
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,240
He's not answering his phone.

651
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,440
He won't.

652
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
He must've even checked in, by now.

653
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,520
You can talk to him, when he gets back from Delhi, day after.

654
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,530
Come on, cheer up guys!

655
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,910
Trust me. He loves you.

656
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,390
He always spoke to me about the two of you.

657
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,490
Excuse me! Our pitcher?

658
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
Drink guys!

659
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,450
Yogi, you've quit your job. Isn't that going to be a problem now?

660
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,900
I'll go back tommorow.

661
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,980
I'll tell them, I went through some hormonal problem!

662
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,510
I have done this before.

663
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,890
What about your phone? It got spilled on, with coffee, didn't it?

664
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,320
Forget the phone. He burned my leg.

665
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,140
It's become all red!

666
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,560
Have to keep applying burnol, without letting Soumya know about it!

667
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,670
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

668
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,760
It won't burn, even if it spills.

669
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,370
You're back!!!

670
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,070
I knew it, you'd come!

671
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,530
This motherf**ker's been talking as if you've died!

672
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,440
You missed your flight?

673
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,220
Didn't miss it. Left it!

674
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,500
Why? Aren't there any bars at the airport?

675
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,290
You think I let go off Beijing for beer?

676
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,580
I came back for the start-up.

677
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,180
Don't worry. Sit down.

678
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,120
Waiter, one more glass please.

679
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,080
What'd happened Naveen?

680
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,860
Rajat asked me if I was sure, that our idea is "one in a million"?

681
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,910
It's just that, I wasn't sure.

682
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,680
So you're sure, now?

683
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,110
No, not sure even now.

684
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,020
But then I thought, if we quit our jobs and try, we might succeed, or we might not.

685
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,250
But if we don't try, then we'll definitely not succeed.

686
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,240
So basically, the moral of the story is...

687
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,430
We're all beers, motherf**kers!

688
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,430
OK, time to safeguard your phones!

689
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
Lets bottoms up first.

690
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,210
But I don't have a glass, Yogi!

691
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,700
-Take this one. -And what about you?

692
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,460
I'll drink from the pitcher!

693
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
Cheers! Cheers!

694
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,160
Give me a second guys.

695
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,130
- So you're quitting your job tomorow?

696
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,030
Yes Chatty, tell me?

697
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,110
Not really tomorrow, becasue I still have to discuss it with Soumya!

698
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,220
Why would you get married, dude?

699
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,060
It's not cumpolsory, to get arrange married, for sex?

700
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,120
Yogi, it's not really for sex

701
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,390
Soumya's also a very good person!

702
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,340
What happened?

703
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,640
Chatty just called.

704
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,050
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

705
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,690
Our name's not on the winner's list!

706
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,040
I knew it!

707
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,550
Hostel 4 guys are the biggest douchebags!!!

708
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,370
Motherf**kers ate bread savouries all night long

709
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,820
And then added their bills to my canteen account!

710
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,580
I hate hostel 4 guys.

711
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:42,680
But wait...

712
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,380
What about my salary now?
