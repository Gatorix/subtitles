1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,620
在这个瞬息万变的世界中，最大的风险是不承担任何风险

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,570
唯一可以保证失败的策略就是不承担风险

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,880
别告诉我是一亿！

20
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,700
妈的! ! ！
F**K!!!

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,580
一亿？
100?

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,130
一个亿？

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,150
巴蒂，你公司的估价是五亿美元？

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,380
妈的! ! ！
F**K!!!

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,880
这有什么大不了的？
So what's the big deal?

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,200
还比 Flipkart 少了75亿美元呢
It's still lesser than Flipkart by 7.5 billion.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,630

F**K, what luck!

29
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,400
这与命运或运气无关……
It's not about fate or luck...

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:42,650
印度管理学院？
IIM?

31
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,930
印度管理学院史瑞拉姆夫人女子学院
LSR. IIM.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,330
我应该作为 CAT 出场的
I should have appeared for CAT.

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,060
你所做的一切，就是喋喋不休地谈论我的运气
All you do, is keep harping about my luck.

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,560
你已经把你的创业想法跟我说过无数次了
You've told me about your start-up idea over a 100 times now.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,780
你为什么着手去做？
Why don't you do something about it?

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,900
一个新的硅谷正在这里崛起
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,200
而你却仍然在 Mokart 上销售那些廉价的山寨手机
And you are still selling these cheap chinese phones on Mokart.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,080
- 他们很有说服力，巴蒂 - 胡说
They're exculsive, Bhati. -Bullshit.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
老弟，没那么简单
Son, its not that easy.

40
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,170
辞掉你的工作，出去创业
Leave your job and venture into the market.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,630
然后你就会知道，命运到底是由什么组成的
And then you will learn, what destinies are made of and from.

42
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,000
老弟你搞什么? 还在喝第一杯啤酒？
Dude, what the f**k? Still on your first beer?

43
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,350
快点喝完！
Down it!

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,800
我不喝了，巴蒂
I'm good, Bhati.

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:18,900
再给他来杯啤酒

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,070
再给他来杯啤酒

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,450
闭嘴! ! ！
Shut up!!!

49
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,120
巴蒂，我现在已经变得非常自律了
Bhati, I've become very discipled now.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,440
甚至不需要闹钟就能醒来
Nowadays I don't even need an alarm to wake up..

51
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,360
不去上班吗？
Not going to the office?

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,390
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

53
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,730
我开了热水器
I switched on the geyser

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
正在烧水
The water's still heating up.

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,760
曼达尔，你为什么在我的浴室里洗澡？
Mandal why do you take a bath in my bathroom?

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,860
我的桶把手坏了
The handle of my bucket is broken.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,810
那你可以把我的桶拿到你的浴室去啊
So, take my bucket to your bathroom.

58
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
实际上，我今天想洗个淋浴
Actually, I feel like taking a shower today.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,770
大哥，你完全可以在自己的浴室洗淋浴啊
Dude, you can take a shower even in your own bathroom.

60
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
一定是水烧好了了！
The water must've heated up!

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,780
至少别用我的毛巾啊
Atleast spare my towel.

62
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,060
Mokart 把我坑惨了，巴蒂，从头坑到尾
Mokart f**ked me over Bhati. Completely f**ked me.

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,260
我为这个巴西的项目付出了很多努力

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,400
甚至周日也加班工作

Must've made more than 5000 excel sheets.

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,650
当需要指定项目负责人的时候，竟然没选我，他们另外派人去里约
And when it came down to leading the team, instead of me, they sent someone else to Rio.

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
巴蒂，我要报仇！
Bhati, I will take revenge!

69
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,340
我一定要报仇！
I will take revenge for sure!

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,400
我一定会找他们报仇的，巴蒂
I will even avenge them, Bhati.

71
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,630
一旦我拿到融资
Once I get the funding

72
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,290
我会赚很多钱，巴蒂... 很多钱
I'll make so much money Bhati... So much money

73
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,290
我要把Mokart买下来，然后……
I'll buy Mokart and...

74
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,910
然后在 OLX 上卖了，操他妈的
And sell it on OLX, f**king shit.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,980
但是我要怎么做呢，巴蒂？
But how, Bhati?

76
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,360
我怎样才能融到钱，巴蒂？
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

77
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,740
不是每个人的运气都像你那么好
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

78
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,300
你是什么？
What are you?

79
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,580
什么意思？
What do you mean, what am I?

80
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,160
你是什么？
What are you?

81
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,460
我是mokart. com的区域经理，纳文·班萨尔

82
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,900

83
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,290
-区域经理…… -你是啤酒

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,720
什么意思？
What do you mean?

85
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,840
你是啤酒，混蛋
You're beer, motherf**ker.

86

你是啤酒

87
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,520
这个瓶子呢? 这是你的公司
And this bottle here? This is your company

88
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,020
你以为，如果你能到玻璃杯里面
You think, you'll get into the glass.

89
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,990
你会玩得很开心

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,860
不是吗？
Isn't it?

91
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,910
但是看看这个
But look at this.

92
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,520
看到了吗？
Can you see?

93
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,470
你实际上不想离开啤酒瓶
You actually don't want to leave the bottle.

94
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,520
想把啤酒倒进杯子里，它需要先离开啤酒瓶
For the beer to get into the glass... It needs to leave the bottle first

95
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,470
一旦你从瓶子里出来
Once you're out of the bottle

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,600
你就可以进入任何你想要的玻璃杯
Then you can get into any glass you want.

97
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,490
可以是这个杯子，如果你想要的话
In this glass, if you want.

98
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,990
或者你也可以到这个玻璃杯
Or you can get into this glass

99
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,540
-甚至是在这个杯子里 -这是一个葡萄酒杯
Even in this glass. -Its a wine glass.

100
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,960
你怎么知道的？
How the hell do YOU know that?

101
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,590
你是啤酒
You are beer.

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,130
明白了吗？
Get it?

103
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,500
你想去哪儿就去哪儿
You can go wherever you want.

104
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,810
明白吗？
Understand?

105
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,440
但是首先你得从瓶子里出来
But it's quintissential you come out of the bottle, first.

106
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,510
一旦你出来了，你可以装满一半的杯子
Once you are out, you could fill half the glass

107
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,700
也可能不会
Or maybe you won't.

108
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,030
但是如果你不出来
But if you don't come out

109
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,710
那你肯定填不满，看到了吗
Then you'll definitely not be able to fill it. Look here.

110
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,450
你的工作不是问问题
And its not your job to ask the questions.

111
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,690
你是啤酒

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,010
你的工作就是流动
And your job is to flow.

113
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,020
你是啤酒
You are beer.

114
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,270
这是啤酒
This is beer.

115
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,390
不是玻璃杯

116
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,770
事实上没有玻璃杯
Infact there is no glass.

117
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,550
但是桌子上有一个玻璃杯，巴蒂
But there is a glass on the table, Bhati.

118
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
没有
No glass.

119
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
我是啤酒，巴蒂
I am a beer, Bhati.

120
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,900
我是啤酒
I am beer.

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,160
我要从啤酒瓶里出来
And I'll get out of the bottle.

122
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,170
我会从瓶子里出来……
I will get out of the bottle...

123
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,950
你要吃早餐吗？
Will you have breakfast?

124
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,380
嗯
Yes

125
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,620
你想吃什么？
What do you want to eat?

126
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,760
面包 煎蛋卷
Bread Omlett.

127
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,200
我们没有鸡蛋了
We've no eggs left.

128
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,630
面包 果酱
Bread Jam.

129
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,580
哪种，混合水果还是芒果？
Which one, mixed fruit or mango?

130
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,640
混合水果

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,910
混合水果上个星期就没有了！
The mixed fruit one, got done with, last week itself!

132
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,640
那就芒果吧！

133
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,330
我们根本就没有芒果果酱！
We didn't get any mango in the first place!

134
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,120
就给我烤面包吧
Just toast the bread for me.

135
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,790
烤面包机已经坏了很久了
The toaster's been broken for such a long time, now!

136
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,340
老哥，我就喝杯茶就够了
Dude, one cup tea will do.

137
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,930
但我已经把所有的牛奶都用来做凝乳了！

你觉得我会害怕吗？

169
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,810
我是个懦夫吗？

170
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,450
我什么时候说过..

事实上，你的整个公司就是一个粪坑
Infact your whole company, is an a**hole.

180
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,970
所以你和你的公司可以从我的生活中消失了
So you and your company are fired from my life.

181
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,610
晚安，拉杰 · 欣德

这是谁？

00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,170

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
亲爱的先生

190
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,850
敬爱的先生，我真的很抱歉

191
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,570
什么事，八卦？
Yaa Chatty, tell me

192
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,550
但是美国国家航空航天局秘密会议的结果应该在下周公布，不是吗？
But NasCom conclave's result where supposed to be out next week, weren't they?

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720

196
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,250
好的

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,700
那么... 他说了什么？
So..What did he say?

198
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,220
开什么玩笑！
You've got to be kidding me!

199
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,470
你确定吗？
Are you sure?

200
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,520

我的 b 计划会被选中吗？
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

202
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,410
妈的! ! ！

211
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,480
小文文

00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,220
你真是个不负责任的人
You are so irresponsible man.

213
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,660
这东西就在你的马桶后面
This was lying behind your commode.

214
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,000
我该怎么处理它？
What do I do with it?

215
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,070
拜托你件事，曼达尔

合理分配时间，你是公司非常重要的员工

218
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,370
节约用水，你是公司非常重要的员工

219
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,760
他把我叫到办公室，开始对我大喊大叫！
He called me in the office and started yelling at me!

220

221
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,170
……如果你对我的睡眠时间有疑问
..if you have so much problem with me sleeping..

222
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,440
那么你应该把我转到人力资源部

223
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,220
他们甚至可以得到额外的睡眠奖励”
They even get an extra bonus for sleeping, there"

224
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,600

225
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,940

228
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,210
还有烟吗？
Do you have an extra?

229
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,080
没了，这是最后一支
No, it's the last one.

230
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,530
没事，把烟吹到我脸上
No issue. Blow it on my face.

231
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,510
被动抽两口也行

你的评估太棒了！
You were amazing in the appraisal!

235
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,700
顺便问一下，你看了昨晚的《纳克 · 巴利耶》吗？
By the way, did you watch last night's Nach Baliye??

236
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,760

237
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,000
你是怎么知道的？

238
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,520
昨晚看的，晚上9点的节目
Saw it last night. The 9pm show.

239
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,380
然后又看了11:30的重播
And then again, the 11:30 repeat telecast.

240
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,180
不，我是说评估，你怎么知道的？
No, I mean about the appraisal. How do you know about that?

241
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,390
评估? 哦! ！
Appraisal ? Ohh!!!

242
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,700
乔希先生给我们看过
Joshi sir showed it to us.

243
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,260
即便是“成就箱”也不够大
Even the 'Acheivement box' wasn't big enough.

244
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,980
虽然我什么都没得到过
Though I didn't really get one thing!

245
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,670
但是为什么你在自我评价中给自己打了4分？
Why did you gave yourself 4 out of 5 in the self evaluation?

246
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,780
我就知道! 我应该给自己3.5..
I knew it! I should've given myself 3.5...

247
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,570
3.5分？
3.5?

248
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,120
你应该给自己5分
You should've given yourself 5 out of 5.

249
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,600
还不够完美吗？
What more could you possibly do?

250
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,720
告诉我，你还能做些什么？
No tell me, what more can you do?

251
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,000
杰图，我能告诉你一些事情吗？
Jeetu, can I tell you something?

252
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,510
每当我们拿到你写的代码

253
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,380
我们直接上传，都不用测试
We forward it, without even testing it

254
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,050
为什么要浪费时间呢？

255
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,910
乔希先生一直称赞你

256
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:44,940

你会来吗？

260
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,070
乔希先生说了什么？
What was Joshi sir saying?

261
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,280
乔希先生说，他会来的！
Joshi sir said, he will come!

262
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,130
实际上……
Actually what happened was...

263
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,620
不是 我是说乔希先生说我什么了？
No!!! No!! I meant what was Joshi sir saying about me?

264
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,130
你刚才说的……
You said something...

265
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,050
哦
Ohh

266
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,000
不仅是乔希先生
Not only Joshi sir

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,050
而是整个部门都这么说
But the whole department says this.

268
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,540
而是整个部门都这么说
But the whole department says this.

269
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,620
"不管别人怎么样，你一定会升职的"
"Whether or not someone else does... you are defintely getting promoted"

270
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,110
没有别的可能
And there's no two ways about it.

271
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,680
好了，我该走了，我还有工作要做
OK!!! I should be going, I have work to do.

272
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,720
吃块口香糖
Take a chewing gum.

273
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,080
- 不用了 -是薄荷味的
-No!!! No!! -Its mint flavoured.

274
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,110
不了，你自己吃吧
No, no.. You can have it.

275
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,130
好的，过几个小时我也走了，我要休息一下了

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,580
但我得了5分！
I got scored 5 out of 5 in my evaluation!

410
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,710
这就是我要说的，5分就是你工作的极限了 然后呢？ 你不会得到超过5分的分数
Thats what I am saying, 5 is the limit of your job. What after then? You won't score anything above 5.

411
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,600
你是否想要度过只有5分的人生？
Do you want to get through life, only scoring 5 out of 5?

412
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,640
听着，我给你解释一下……
Listen, I will explain it to you...

413
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,320
你是什么？
What are you?

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,210
你是什么？
What are you?

415
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,340
我是什么? 我是杰图，已婚IT男，还有什么？
What am I? I am Jitu, married and what else?

416
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,140
不! 不! 你是什么？
No!!No!!1 What ARE you?

417
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,390
你是什么？
What are you?

418
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,970
你疯了吗，纳文？
Are you out of your mind , Naveen?

419
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,230
你是咖啡
You're Coffee.

420
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
什么？
-What?

421
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,200
你是咖啡，混蛋
You're coffee, Motherf**ker.

422
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,940
你是咖啡..
You are coffee...

423
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,190
这个杯子是你的公司
And this cup is your company.

424
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:15,010
现在你以为你可以享受钻进玻璃杯的乐趣……
Now you think you'lll have fun getting into the glass...

425
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,040
但是你不想离开咖啡杯
But you don't want to leave the cup.

426
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,030
现在如果你想流进玻璃杯里，你必须先从咖啡杯里出来
Now if you want to flow into the glass, you have to get out of the cup first.

427
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,370
等会……
Easy. Easy.

428
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,180
你到底想说什么？
What do you want to say exactly?

429
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,520
我想说的是，一旦你出去了，你就可以进入这个玻璃杯..
All I'm saying is, once you're out, you can go into this glass...

430
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,460
你可以钻进这个玻璃杯
You can get into this glass.

431
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:32,610
或者这个..
Or this...

432
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,310
现在你可能会想"这是个糖碗……
Now you might think, "This is a sugar bowl

433
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,120
但我是咖啡，我怎么才能进去呢? ”
but I am coffee. How can I get inside this?"

434
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,500
不是吗？
Won't you?

435
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,940
但你怎么知道? 你是咖啡..
But how do YOU know? You're coffee...

436
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,720
老哥，你在干什么？
Dude, what are doing?

437
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,770
对不起，对不起，对不起..
Sorry, Sorry, Sorry, Sorry...

438
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,990
你在干什么? 我的手机..
What are you doing dude? My phone...

439
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,720
如果是啤酒的话就会顺利多了……
It happened so well, with a beer!

440
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,980
我想说的是..
So, what I was trying to say is...

441
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,570
不管你想说什么，跟别人说去吧
Whatever you want to say, tell it to someone else

442
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,660
你辞掉了工作
You've left your job and let go

443
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,540
你以为你就是乔布斯了吗？
What do you think, you're Steve Jobs?

444
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,620
-我想说的是...-首先，自己先理清楚，你想做什么..
What I was trying to say is... -First, figure it out for yourself, what you want to do...

445
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,360
然后我们再谈
We'll then sit and talk it down

446
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,710
但是你要去哪里呢？
But where are you going?

447
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,680
去买醋栗！
To buy gooseberry!

448
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,350
我明白..
I understood...

449
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:19,350
是的
Yeah.

450
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,130
那个混蛋有一天打电话给我说
The f**ker called me the other day and said

451
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,850
“为什么总是拿人力资源团队开玩笑？
"Why do keep joking about the H.R. team?

452
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,990
你知道做一个人力资源经理需要多少天赋吗? ”
Do you know how much talent it takes, to be an H.R. manager?"

453
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,270
我说”先生
I said, "Sir

454
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,150
一天睡22个小时..
To sleep for 22 hours a day...

455
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,550
绝对需要很多天赋! ”
definitely takes a lot of talent!"

456
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,710
你的拉链开了！
Your fly's open!

457
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,950
他上当了！哈哈哈
He took the bait!

458
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,050
吸烟有害健康，你是公司非常重要的员工

459
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,810
杰图 兄弟！

After Brazil project, I was really upset, so I got drunk and I...

所以我只能祈祷了
So I am just keeping my fingers crossed.

533
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,250
哇! 裸辞创业！
Wow! Full time start-up, then!

Ohh, of course! I've read a lot, about him. Really?

Of course! Of course! You're the entrepreneur.

547

他就是这样开始的... 创业

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,670
看看他今天在哪儿！

去年他的公司估值为..

552
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,590
你听说过 Harshit Kothari 吗？

他也是我的室友

554

哈斯特？

555
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,320
没听过吗？
No?

556
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:44,860
没有
No...

557
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,060
不管怎样，他也是从这样的创业开始的
Anyway, even he began with the start-up like this

558
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,040
项目叫什么来着..
What was it's name again...

559
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
不记得了，总之……

560
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:56,410
不幸的是... ... 想法很好，但效果不太好
Unfortunately... It was a good idea, but it didn't do so well.

561
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,770

回到他的工作岗位

568
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,310
索拉布 · 法希
Saurabh Vahi...

569
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,820
没听过
I don't think so.

570
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,200
当然，你现在可是大人物了！
Of course. You're in the big league now!

571
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,870
你将会赢得一场声望很高的比赛！
You're going to win a prestigious competition!

572
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,480
这个比赛每年都举行吗？
Is this competition held every year?

573
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,180
是啊，已经举办了7-8年了

574
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,410
哇! 7-8年了！
Wow! 7-8 years!

575
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,660
那么，之前的获奖者中有多少人已经成功了呢？
So how many of the previous winners have made it big?

576
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,410
以前的赢家! ! ！
Previous winners!!!

577
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,120
其实我也不知道
I don't know actually.

578
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,390
每当这个国家的毕业生厌倦了朝九晚五的工作..
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

579
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,330
所以，为了摆脱困境，他们只有三个选择
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

580
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,190
读MBA
MBA

581
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
读IAS
IAS

582
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,150
或者去创业
or Start-Up.

583
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,030
出去看看，纳文
Go out and take a look, Naveen.

584
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,380
创业公司的创始人们坐在三个小屋中的两个里面
There are start-up founders sitting in 2 out of 3 cabins, out there.

585
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:05,770
纳文..
Naveen...

586
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,350
你真的认为你的想法是百万分之一吗？
Do you really think your idea is one in a million?

587
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:12,960
听着
Look!

588
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,470
你认为这是你所向往的……
You think this is your passion...

589
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,810
这就是为什么，你要离开这份工作
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

590
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,570
这就是为什么，你要离开这份工作
And that is why, you're leaving this job.

591
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,420
但这不是…… 纳文
But, this is not your passion, Naveen.

592
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,310
如果真的是这样，那么很久之前……
If this was your passion, then you would've left this job...

593
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,210
就辞职了
A long time back.

594
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,210
你不会等着被巴西项目拒绝
You wouldn't have waited for being rejected from the Brazil project.

595
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,810
不..
No...

596
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,840
不... 我不这样认为
No...I don't

597
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,300
我觉得..
I think....

598
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
北京
Beijing.

599
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,550
我们准备开始在那里扩张，比原计划提前了6个月
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

600
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,520
一周内有个会议
Apointment within a week.

601
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,020
我们需要一个聪明人
We need someone smart over there...

602
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,180
像你一样
Like you.

603
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,990
你要在20分钟内……
You have to leave for your... Visa appointment, in Delhi in...

604
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,070
去德里办签证
The next 20 mins.

605
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:00,750
那天晚上你打电话给我
That night when you called me.

606
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,890
你并没有做出选择
You did not make a choice.

607
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,800
你只是表现出拒绝
You were simply reacting to a rejection.

608
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,330
现在才是真正的选择
Now is the real choice.

609
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:11,910
想想吧，纳文
Think about it, Naveen.

610
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,370
已经得到的一定比不确定的更好
One in hand is obviously better than one not-so-sure in the bush.

611
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,120
不是吗？
No?

612
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,750
杰图：创业带我一个，8点酒吧见面？

613
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,870
尤吉：哟！你今天要喝啤酒

614
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,170
纳文
Naveen

615
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,320
在我的浴室里
In my bathroom.

616
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,090
你让我不要用你的卫生间，我怎么用？
How will I use your bathroom, after you've asked me not to?

617
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,650
什么事？
Yeah, tell me?

618
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,820
真是奇怪啊
How strange is this?

619
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,300
纳文没有升职，所以辞职了
Naveen didn't get promoted, so he quit his job.

620
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,310
现在你却想在升职后辞职
And now you're thinking of quitting, after you've been promoted.

621
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,060
人类的大脑是个谜，伙计
Human brain is a mystery, bud.

622
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,430
你想点些什么吗？
-You wanna order something?

623
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,060
你想点什么？
What do you want to order?

624
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,030
我们来吃冷玉米吧
Let's do chilly babycorn.

625
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,200
“每公斤1000卢比! ”
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

626
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,630
“每公斤1000卢比! ”
"Rs. 1000 per Kg!"

627
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,540
计划辞职的人，不要吃玉米粒！
People planning to quit their job, don't eat babycorn!

628
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,490
伙计，我听说会有大笔资金流入，好吗？
Dude, I was told there's going to be an influx of money, ok?

629
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,670
要发工资了，我要订购婴儿玉米！
I'm going to get a salary and hence, I'm ordering babycorn!

630
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,000
我们也给纳文点点东西吧
-Let's order something for Naveen too.

631
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,040
是的，他一定在路上了
Yeah, he must be on his way.

632
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,080
是的，他一定在路上了
Yeah, he must be on his way.

633
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,220
纳文来不了了
Naveen's not going to be able to make it.

634
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,280
曼达尔？
-Mandal?

635
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,430
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

636
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,920
事实上..
Actually...

637
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,540
是他让我来这儿的
He's the one who requested me to come here.

638
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,970
他..
He...

639
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,770
不得不马上离开
... had to leave urgently.

640
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,390
去哪里？
But where?

641
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,530
请去机场
Airport please.

642
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,200
这对他来说是一个非常艰难的决定
It was a very tough decision for him.

643
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,620
他很伤心
He was very sad.

644
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,610
还哭了
He waas even crying.

645
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,240
你说真的? 他哭了？
Are you serious? He was crying?

646
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,460
我是说，电话里听不出来吧
I mean, you can't really tell on the phone, can you?

647
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,320
但是他的声音..
But his voice...

648
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,480
听起来很沉重
... sounded heavy.

649
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,880
但他为什么不打电话给我们？
But why didn't he call us?

650
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,150
他很匆忙，所以打电话给他最好的朋友
He was in a hurry. So called up his best friend.

651
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:23,160
面对你们他一定很难过
He must be feeling really bad about facing you guys.

652
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,510
他一定感到很内疚
He must be feeling very guilty.

653
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,270
你能开快一点吗？
Could you please drive a little faster?

654
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,050
否则，我就要错过我的航班了！
Or else, I'm going to miss my flight!

655
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,540
先生，你看这里的交通有多堵！
Sir, you see how there's so much traffic here!

656
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,250
还有另外一条路可以通过昌迪瓦利
There's this one other way via Chandivali

657
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:34,360
我们要走那边吗？
Should we try that?

658
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,600
我们要走那边吗？
Should we try that?

659
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,240
能准时到达机场吗？
Will it get us to the airport on time?

660
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,710
那里不会堵车吧？
There won't be any traffic there?

661
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,340
我们可以去碰碰运气
We can find that out, only once, we take that road.

662
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,090
但是如果我们堵在这里
But if we stay stuck here, in this traffic...

663
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,090
那肯定是赶不上飞机了！
Then you'll definitely miss your flight!

664
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,570
好吧，那我们就走你说的路
Alright then, let's try that one, then.

665
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,240
他不接电话
He's not answering his phone.

666
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,440
他不会接的
He won't.

667
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
他现在肯定已经登记入住了
He must've even checked in, by now.

668
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,520
你可以在他从德里回来后的第二天和他谈谈
You can talk to him, when he gets back from Delhi, day after.

669
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,530
来吧，开心点，伙计们！
Come on, cheer up guys!

670
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,910
相信我，他爱你
Trust me. He loves you.

671
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,390
他总是跟我提起你们俩
He always spoke to me about the two of you.

672
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,490
打扰一下! 我们的酒杯呢？
Excuse me! Our pitcher?

673
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
喝吧，伙计们！
Drink guys!

674
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,450
尤吉，你已经辞职了，这不是个问题吗？
Yogi, you've quit your job. Isn't that going to be a problem now?

675
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,900
我明天就回去
I'll go back tommorow.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,980
我会告诉他们今天是荷尔蒙作祟
I'll tell them, I went through some hormonal problem!

677
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,510
我以前也这么做过
I have done this before.

678
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,890
你的手机呢? 洒进咖啡了，对吧？
What about your phone? It got spilled on, with coffee, didn't it?

679
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,320
别提电话了，他烫伤了我的腿
Forget the phone. He burned my leg.

680
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,140
都烫红了
It's become all red!

681
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,560
还要瞒着桑亚涂药膏！
Have to keep applying burnol, without letting Soumya know about it!

682
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,670
让我用啤酒再给你们讲一遍
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

683
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,760
它不会烫伤你，只会洒出来
It won't burn, even if it spills.

684
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,370
你回来了！
You're back!!!

685
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,070
我就知道你会来的！
I knew it, you'd come!

686
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,530
这个混蛋一直说得好像你已经死了一样！
This motherf**ker's been talking as if you've died!

687
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,440
你错过了航班？
You missed your flight?

688
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,220
没有错过，离开了！
Didn't miss it. Left it!

689
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,500
为什么? 机场没有酒吧吗？
Why? Aren't there any bars at the airport?

690
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,290
你以为我会为了啤酒放弃去北京吗？
You think I let go off Beijing for beer?

691
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,580
我回来是为了创业
I came back for the start-up.

692
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,180
别担心，坐下
Don't worry. Sit down.

693
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,120
服务员，再来一杯
Waiter, one more glass please.

694
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,080
纳文怎么了？
What'd happened Naveen?

695
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,860
拉杰问我是否确定，我们的想法是“百万分之一” ？
Rajat asked me if I was sure, that our idea is "one in a million"?

696
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,910
只是我不确定
It's just that, I wasn't sure.

697
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,680
你现在确定了？
So you're sure, now?

698
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,110
不，现在还不确定
No, not sure even now.

699
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,020
但是后来我想，如果我们辞掉工作去尝试，我们可能会成功，也可能不会
But then I thought, if we quit our jobs and try, we might succeed, or we might not.

700
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,250
但是如果我们不尝试，那么我们肯定不会成功
But if we don't try, then we'll definitely not succeed.

701
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,240
所以基本上，这个故事的寓意是..
So basically, the moral of the story is...

702
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,430
我们都是啤酒，混蛋！
We're all beers, motherf**kers!

703
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,430
好了，是时候保护你的手机了！
OK, time to safeguard your phones!

704
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,880
让我们先干杯
Lets bottoms up first.

705
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,210
但是没有玻璃杯，尤吉！
But I don't have a glass, Yogi!

706
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,700
- 拿着这个-那你呢？
-Take this one. -And what about you?

707
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,460
我用这个喝
I'll drink from the pitcher!

708
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,800
干杯! 干杯！
Cheers! Cheers!

709
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,160
等我一下，伙计们
Give me a second guys.

710
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,130
所以你明天就辞职？
- So you're quitting your job tomorow?

711
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,030
是的，怎么样了？
Yes Chatty, tell me?

712
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,110
不一定是明天，因为我还要和桑亚商量一下！
Not really tomorrow, becasue I still have to discuss it with Soumya!

713
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,220
你为什么要结婚？
Why would you get married, dude?

714
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,060
又没有人逼你结婚，难道是为了啪啪啪？
It's not cumpolsory, to get arrange married, for sex?

715
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,120
尤吉，不是的
Yogi, it's not really for sex

716
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,390
桑亚是一个很好的人！
Soumya's also a very good person!

717
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,340
发生了什么？
What happened?

718
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,640
八卦刚打电话来
Chatty just called.

719
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,050
阿克希尔给我坑了
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

720
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,690
我们的名字不在获胜者名单上！
Our name's not on the winner's list!

721
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,040
我就知道！
I knew it!

722
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,550
四号酒店的家伙是一群混蛋
Hostel 4 guys are the biggest douchebags!!!

723
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,370
狗娘养的整晚都在吃面包
Motherf**kers ate bread savouries all night long

724
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,820
然后把他们的账单加到我的食堂账户上！
And then added their bills to my canteen account!

725
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,580
我恨死四号酒店的人了！
I hate hostel 4 guys.

726
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:42,680
但是等等..
But wait...

727
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,380
现在我的薪水怎么办？
What about my salary now?
