1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,600
融资的过程就好似一场摩诃婆罗多之战
Getting a funding is equal to fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,700
我至少要占股51%
I want atleast 51%

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,870
明天还有个活动，不会有潜在的投资者吗？
Tomorrow, you have an event, won't there be potential investors?

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,250
我们没时间了，史瑞雅
We are running out of time, Shreya

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,700
这么说只有你们三个？
So only 3 of you guys?

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,200
不，先生，我们有四个人，杰图正在来的路上
No sir, we are four of us. Jeetu is on his way

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,320
喂，尤吉，我不能去了，我爸突然来我家了
Yogi i can't come, All of a sudden dad showed up!

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,820
等一下，杰图
Wait a minute Jitu.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,320
回来坐下
Sit over here.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
真的非常抱歉，但这是我第四次告诉您
I'm really really sorry sir, but this is the fourth time i'm telling you

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,300
除非团队人到齐了，否则我不能给你们通行证
that i can not give you the passes until the entire team registered

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,550
所以我们这样，在你们的报价后面……
So the amount which you guys had proposed?

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,300
加一个零
Suffix a zero to the number.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,050
我需要一个陪审室
I need a jury room.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,620
兄弟们，不是这样的，每次我在陪审室里做出决定都是正确的
You know, whenever I've taken a decision in the jury room, it's always been right

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,500
他他妈的扔了一枚硬币然后就定了
He fucking tosses a coin and decides.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
作出决定依据是抛硬币的过程，而不是抛硬币的结果
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing the coin, not on the result of it.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,700
如果只是因为钱，那我不能让任何人控制我的野心
Just for more funding I can't let anyone control my ambitions.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,350
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going ?

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,020
回去继续参加活动
Back to the event.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,060
但是如果他们不让我们进去呢
But what if they don't let us in!

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,170
那就用我们的一贯操作
The same thing what we always do ..

23
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,300
试试
Try.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,150
我们做过的最厉害的事情就是没放弃

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,730
爸爸，我刚给你煮了咖啡
Dad, I just made you some coffee

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,250
我去帮你拿
Let me get it for you

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,230
不用，你坐下
No No, Just sit down

28
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,730
杰图刚刚还在这里
Jeetu was just right here

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,950
我打了30分钟的瞌睡
I dozed off for 30 minutes

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,730
他就不见了
and he is nowhere to be seen

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,530
他告诉你他去哪儿了吗？
Did he tell you where he has gone?

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,230
没有，但他一定就在附近
No but he must be around the block

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,630
他马上就回来
He'll be back in a jiffy

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,730
是吗？
Oh yeah?

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,730
他通常什么时候从办公室回家？
when does he usually get back home from the office?

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,730
大概在晚上7点到7:30
almost by 7PM or 7:30 PM

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,730
但是门卫告诉我，他晚上一般两三点钟回来
But watchman told me that he usually gets back by 2 or 3 in the night

38
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,630
有时候他第二天早上才回来
and sometimes he'd get back next day in the morning

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,530
是的，有时候
yeah sometimes

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,730
但他会提前打电话告诉我他会晚点回家
But he tells me beforehand on the phone if he's gonna be home late

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,730
是吗？
oh really?

42
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,730
你能从电话里看出他是在办公室里说话吗？
can you tell from the phone that he's speaking from the office?

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,430
他可能是从任何地方打来的
He could be calling from anywhere

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,730
什么意思
I don't follow

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,330
我从网上查到了他的公司
Look, I took the contact number from the website

46
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,730
给他的公司打了电话
and called his company

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,530
他们告诉我那个办公室已经关门两天了
They told me that office has been closed for two days

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,330
你知道这两天他去哪儿了吗？
Now do you know where he's been for last 2 days?

49
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,730
我不知道，爸爸
Umm No Dad

50
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,730
桑亚……
Soumya...

51
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,730
你和他……
You and him...

52
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,530
相处得很好，对吗？
are getting along with each other, right?

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,730
当然了，爸爸，但是……
Ofcourse Dad but...

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,530
但是您要说什么？
But what's the matter?

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,730
不，没什么
No It's nothing

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,530
问题是他才26岁
Thing is that he's just 26 years old

57
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,730
我们不知道他和谁有联系
we don't know who he's been associating with

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,430
你这样
Do one thing..

59
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,230
看好他
Keep an eye on him

60
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,730
监控他的手机，信用卡和账单
Monitor his phones, credit cards and bills

61
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,930
检查他衣服上的唇印，如果有的话
Check for the lipstick marks on his clothes, if any

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,230
哦，是的……
oh yes and..

63
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,930
切一些洋葱和香菜叶
Chop some onion and coriander leaves

64
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,630
然后放进蔬菜里。
and put it in the vegetable..

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,830
再煮5分钟
and cook for 5 more minutes

66
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,230
杰图的妈妈就是这么做的
Jeetu's mom follows the same recipe

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,730
你去哪儿了，孩子？
So Where were you, Son?

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,730
哦，我只是在外面慢跑
Oh I was just jogging outside

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,730
穿人字拖跑？
In flip flops?

70
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,330
其实我跑得很慢
I.. I was running at a slow pace actually

71
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,630
下次尽量快一点
Try at a fast pace next time

72
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,330
好了，现在把你的手机给我
Alright now give me your phone

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,730
我得给你阿姨打个电话
I have to call your Aunt

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,730
我给她打吧？
Why don't I call her?

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,230
我已经很久没和她说过话了
It's been a long time since I've spoken to her

76
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,930
那好吧
Okay, very well then

77
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,730
那你给她打电话
You call her then

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,730
用杰图的手机打给她，然后跟我聊聊她最近怎样
Call her from Jeetu's phone and tell me how's she doing

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,730
我在外面看报纸
I'll be out here reading newspaper

80
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,330
我不能再这么做了
I can't do this anymore

81
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,530
为什么? 发生什么了？
Why? What happened?

82
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,730
他以为你外面有人了
He thinks that you're having a love affair with someone

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,730
让我监视你
He was asking me to spy on you

84
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,230
这都是因为那个白痴门卫
this is all because of that moronic watchman

85
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,730
我要写一份开除他的请愿书
gotta write a petition for his expulsion

86
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,430
而且纳文和队友们最近发生了很多事
Also Naveen and team has been going through a lot lately

87
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,230
到晚上我们就会知道该怎么走下一步了
We'll know by the evening what we're gonna do with the startup

88
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,730
你真的没有外遇，对吗？
Umm you're really not having an affair. right?

89
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,730
桑亚你怎么……
Soumya What the...

90
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,730
我都已经跟不上工作的节奏了而你却在谈论外遇？
I can't even keep up with my job here and you're taking about affair?

91
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,730
那你为什么不告诉爸爸？
Then why don't you tell this to Dad?

92
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,730
你辞职了，加入了创业公司。
That you've left the job and about this startup..

93
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,230
现在还不是时候
It's not the right time yet

94
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,230
那要等到什么时候？
So, when it's gonna be?

95
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,730
他迟早会知道的
He's gonna know about it one way or another

96
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,330
通过办公室或者门卫，或者从其他地方
Through Office or by watchman or maybe from some other place

97
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,730
你最好自己告诉他
it's better that you tell him about it yourself

98
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,530
伙计们，我不是开玩笑
Guys I'm not joking

99
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,630
我妈妈过去常常亲吻我的额头以求好运
My mom used to kiss me on my forehead for luck

100
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,530
我每次考试都成功了
and it worked every time in my exams

101
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,430
我们的额头上有一个神圣的紫色脉轮
We have a sacred purple chakra in our forehead

102
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,730
我告诉你，我们一直被坏运气束缚着
I'm telling you, we've been girdled by bad luck

103
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,630
有人吻我的额头，一切都会好起来的
Someone kiss me on my forehead, everything will be alright

104
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,730
等等，曼达尔，我们得先找到评委
Hold up Mandal, We gotta find the judges first

105
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,730
你知道我怎么想的吗？
You know what I think?

106
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,730
把其他人都放在一边，让我们把注意力集中在 纳拉扬·默西 (INFOSYS 的创始人)身上
Leave everyone else aside and let's focus on Narayan Murthy(founder of INFOSYS*)

107
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,730
听着，我不在乎进入或许可
Look, I don't care about entry or permission

108
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,630
但是我要让那个婊子阿波娃付出代价！ 纳文！
but I'm going to make that bitch Apoorva pay for what she did to us 86 00:05:025,000 --> 00:05:26,500 Hey Yogi! Naveen!

109
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,730
嘿，阿米特什！
Hey Amitesh!

110
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,730
你怎么样，混蛋？
How're you doing fucker?

111
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,730
我很好，你呢？
I'm well and good. How about you?

112
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,730
你吃午饭了吗？
Did you have the lunch yet?

113
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,730
还没有，兄弟
Not yet bro

114
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,630
伙计，你错过了最好的黄油鸡肉
Man, you're missing out on the best butter chicken out there

115
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,730
我已经吃了6盘了
I've already eaten 6 plates

116
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,730
现在快去排队吧，他们只剩这么多了
Get in the line now, they only have so much left

117
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,030
但你他妈的在这里干什么？
But what the fuck are you doing here?

118
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,730
你也创建了一个创业公司吗？
Did you create a startup too?

119
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,730
你能帮我拿一下吗？
Can you hold this for me?

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,730
小心糕点
Watch out for the pastry

121
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,730
什么，你说什么？
What? what did you say?

122
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,330
每个星期天都有一个活动或者峰会
Every Sunday there's an Event or E summit

123
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,730
我注册只是为了来这吃鸡肉
And I just register only to gulp a lot of chicken

124
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,230
看，我甚至给了他们一个提示
Look, I even give them a hint

125
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
Petpooja.com (* Hungerlust.com)
petpooja.com (*Hungerlust.com)

126
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,730
但是一直没有人知道我的诡计
But still no one has come to know about my shenanigans

127
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,230
那你呢？
What about you though?

128
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,730
你们的创业理念是什么？
What's the idea of your startup?

129
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,730
我们可能会在台上展示我们的想法
we're presenting our idea on the stage most likely

130
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,430
到时你就知道了
Then you'll know

131
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,730
还等什么? 现在就告诉我
Why so closemouthed about it? Tell me now

132
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,730
好吧，我们的想法是..。
Okay, so the idea is...

133
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,730
如果我现在告诉你，不会降低你的期望值吗？
Won't it lower your anticipation if I told you now?

134
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,730
大学毕业后你一点都没变
you haven't changed a bit since college

135
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,230
没有人比你更戏剧化了
No one could be more melodramatic than you

136
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,530
好吧，就让它成为一个谜吧
alright let it be a mystery then

137
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,430
杰图在哪儿？
Where the hell is Jeetu?

138
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,730
那个混蛋在家里，就是因为他，我们才落得如此地步
The fucker's at home, it's because of him that we're in such abyss

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,730
是吗？
oh really?

140
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,730
是啊
yeah

141
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,830
我们现在得和评委谈谈
We have to talk to the judges now

142
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,530
纳拉扬·穆西来了吗？
Is Narayan Murthy here yet?

143
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,730
他在最后一刻退出了这场活动
He abandoned the event at the last moment

144
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,630
因此，活动工作人员现在已经找到了一个新的替代者
So the event staff has seeked a new replacement now

145
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,130
我听说他是一个资深的、经验丰富的人
I've heard that he's a doyen and very experienced man

146
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,730
我刚才在这附近看到他了
I just saw him around here somewhere

147
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,330
是的，就是他
Yeah, that's him

148
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,530
穿着黑色西装
In the black suit

149
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,730
我想不起他的名字了。
I can't recollect his name..

150
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,330
哦，是的，拉杰 · 卡纳
Oh yes Rajat Khanna

151
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,730
莫卡特孟买分部负责人
Head of Mokart's Mumbai branch

152
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,730
你是要去亲他吗？？？
Do you want the kiss here or in the bathroom?

153
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,930
已经两个小时了，还是锁着的
It's been 2 hours but no one's bothering to unlock this thing

154
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,730
今年的女性参会人数都破纪录了
women have a record participation this year

155
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,730
5位女企业家，竟然这样
5 Female entrepreneurs and this?

156
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,730
我跟你讲，性别歧视也要有个限度
I tell you there has to be a limit to gender discrimination

157
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,930
我是说它无处不在
I mean it's everywhere

158
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,730
在商界，体育界，电影界
In business, in sports, in films

159
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,430
你知道贝克德尔测试吗？
Do you know about the Bechdel test?

160
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,530
不知道
No

161
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,730
来吧，我告诉你来
Come, I'll tell you come

162
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,730
他认识你，试着和他谈谈
He knows you, try talking to him

163
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,330
老哥，我为了办这家公司打乱了他的计划
Dude, I stomped over his project to start this startup

164
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,730
不可能的
There's no chance

165
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,730
收到
Roger that

166
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,230
两分钟后见
See you in two

167
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,530
一切都准备好了
Everything is set

168
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,730
15分钟后我们就能拿到通行证了
We'll be holding the passes in our hands in next 15 minutes

169
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,530
什么，怎么做到的？
What? how?

170
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,530
我只是花了一些时间在人类最具创造力的椅子上
I just spent some time on mankind's most creative chair

171
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,330
我充分利用了它
And I made good use of it

172
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,430
我有3个惊人的计划来参加这个比赛
I have 3 amazing plans to enter this competition

173
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,430
尤吉，别搞那些花里胡哨的
Yogi no violence, no kidnapping

174
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,430
我有一个参加比赛的绝妙计划
I have 1 amazing plan to enter the competition

175
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,930
听我说，这是万无一失的
Hear me out, It's foolproof

176
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,730
计划是这样的
Here's the plan

177
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,030
你们以为自己了解所有的总体规划，对吗？
You guys think that you've heard all the masterplans before, right?

178
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,430
但你们不知道我的
But not mine

179
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,530
有些计划是有效的，有些计划是机智的
Some plans are effective, some plans are brilliant

180
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,730
我的两者都是
Mine is both

181
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,430
5分钟后，阿波娃会在接待处接到一个电话
Right after 5 minutes, Apoorva will recieve a call on the reception

182
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,230
她会到外面去接电话
In order to attend it, she'll go outside

183
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,230
此时曼达尔用气球挡住监控摄像头
Mandal will then block the CCTV by balloons

184
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,630
然后我来转移注意力
And then my diversion

185
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,730
什么? 是真的吗？
What? Is that true?

186
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,730
伙计们，有人看到萨钦在外面
Guys, Sachin was just spotted outside

187
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,730
不是萨钦·德鲁卡，是萨钦·班萨（印度富豪）
Not Sachin Tendulkar you morons, Sachin Bansal

188
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,130
最后纳文要做的是
Finally, all Naveen has to do

189
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,730
把杰图的头像换成别人的
is replace Jeetu's face on our company's profile with somebody else's

190
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,730
就是我们今天的假杰图
And that guy will be our fake Jeetu for a day

191
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,730
等下
NO no no no

192
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,730
你要上传谁的照片来取代杰图？
Whose photo are you gonna upload in place of Jeetu's?

193
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,730
我们需要一个假的杰图
We need a fake Jeetu beforehand

194
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,630
计划很简单，纳文
Plan is foolproof Naveen

195
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
我们我们已经有第四个人了
We have the 4th guy

196
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,730
我刚雇佣了我们的第一个实习生
I've just hired our first intern

197
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,730
他来了
Oh! and he's here

198
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,730
钥匙在脚垫下面
The key is under the doormat

199
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,830
老子能活一百
Live Long Suckers

200
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,730
让我们为恰恰鼓掌
Let's give it up for ChaCha

201
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,730
尤吉，我不太确定，兄弟
Yogi, I'm not so sure bro

202
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,730
你有更好的计划吗？
Do you have a better plan?

203
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,730
那么来吧，我们开始吧
Then come on guys lets do this

204
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,730
你为什么把气球拿进去？
Why are you taking the balloons inside?

205
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,730
今天是我儿子的生日
It.. it's my son's birthday

206
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,230
你儿子是谁？
who is your son?

207
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,730
纳文
Naveen

208
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,730
这里没有纳文
There's no Naveen here

209
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,730
你这气球里面藏了什么？
What are you smuggling inside them?

210
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,730
我要报警了
I'm calling the police

211
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,430
我不想再被关进监狱了
I don't want to get locked behind the bars again

212
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,730
负责人，报警
Organizer, call the ploice

213
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,730
等等，等等
Whoa hold on hold on

214
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,730
他跟我一起的，发生什么事了？
He's with me what happened?

215
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,730
他为什么把气球带到这里来？
Why is he bringing the balloons in here?

216
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,130
你们又来了？
You guys again?

217
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,730
保安，请他们出去，他们已经烦了我好几个小时了
Security, please escort them out of here They have been bugging me for hours

218
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,730
这是怎么回事？
What's going on here?

219
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,730
怎... 怎么了？
Wha.. what's the problem?

220
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,730
纳文？
Naveen?

221
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,550
你们应该早点来找我的
You guys have been here since morning You should've come to me earlier

222
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,030
刚才那是在搞什么？
What the hell was that out there?

223
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,730
先生，通行证准备好了
Sir, the passes sir

224
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,330
我真的很抱歉，我不知道你认识他们
I'm really sorry I didn' know that you know them

225
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,330
就算我不认识他们
Even if I didn't know them

226
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,430
你怎么能阻止别人参加比赛？
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

227
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,480
非常抱歉，先生

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,330
非常抱歉，先生
i'm really sorry sir

229
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
他们不是已经在网站上注册了吗？
Haven't they already registered on the website?

230
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,780
他们还没有准备好产品吗？
Don't they have a product ready?

231
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,530
是的，先生，我真的很抱歉
They do sir, i'm really sorry

232
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,330
所以我觉得你应该和管理层谈谈让她滚蛋
So I think you should talk to the management and get her fired

233
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,730
是的，就该这样，不是吗？
Yeah we should. shouldn't we?

234
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,730
这样就不会有别的队伍因为一个微不足道的规则而被取消比赛资格
So that more teams don't get disqualified for a trivial rule

235
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,730
没关系，先生，她只是在做她的工作
It's okay sir, she was just doing her job

236
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,380
非常感谢您
thank you so much sir

237
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,730
如果我们能报答你的恩惠
If we can ever return your favour

238
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,730
实际上我叔叔是 LIC 的代理人
Actually my uncle is an LIC agent

239
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,530
如果你需要免费保险，这是我的名片
If you ever need a free insurance policy, here's my card

240
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,730
不用了，谢谢你
it's ok

241
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,050
你们工作这么努力，这是我能为我的前雇员做的最起码的事
You guys have worked so hard, this is the least I could do for My ex employee

242
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,730
非常感谢，能遇到你真的很幸运
Thanks a lot, lucky for us that you were here

243
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,730
这点我同意
That I would agree with

244
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,730
只有一件小事
Just one small thing

245
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,930
有些人可能会误会，因为我在开始前就跟你们见面了
Some people might feel that because I know you from before I'm allowing you to participate

246
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,730
然而这里禁止发生有争议的事情，会影响我的形象
So, god forbids if there's a controversy to follow, making me a bad person

247
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,230
你们能不能让其他团队签一份说明让他们同意你参赛
Can you just get the other teams to sign on a paper That they're okay with you participating

248
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,730
其他团队? ，所有其他团队吗？
Others as in? all the other teams?

249
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,730
对的，应该不会超过半小时
yeah, it shouldn't take more than half an hour

250
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,480
而且他们现在肯定在吃午饭
Plus they must be having lunch right now

251
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,830
我不想让其他队伍觉得评委有偏见，懂我的意思吧？
See, I don't want the other teams to feel that the judges are biased, right?

252
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,730
所以，为了安全起见，去找大家签名吧
So, just for safety please get the signatures

253
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,230
好吗，其他评委在等，我我得走了
Okay? okay the other judges are waiting for me I gotta go

254
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,730
但是拉杰，如果我们拿不到签名怎么办？
But Rajat, what if we don't get the signatures?

255
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,130
没有其他团队的同意，我不能让你上台演讲，纳文
Without the other teams' consent I can't allow you to talk about your product Naveen

256
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,230
纳文，你知道我的风格
Naveen you know me

257
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,730
无论规则多么琐碎，但我还是愿意遵守
However trivial the rules are you know I always like to follow them

258
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,730
活动就要开始了
The event's gonna start

259
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,730
请拿到签名
Please get the signatures

260
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,530
是的，我今晚就到
Yes I'm getting there tonight

261
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,130
不，我还没走
No I haven't left yet

262
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,730
我会在晚上8点出发
I'll leave by 8PM

263
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
不是啊，为什么我明天早上才到？
No, why would I reach the next morning?

264
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,730
不会的，我今晚就到
I won't be late, I'll be there tonight

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
我不坐火车了
I won't be taking train

266
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,730
杰图给我订了一张机票
Jeetu booked me a flight ticket

267
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,470
是的，他最近升职了
Yes, he just got a promotion

268
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,730
好吧，我晚点再跟你说
Alright man, I'll talk to you later

269
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,730
怎么了？
What happened?

270
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,230
没什么，我只是想看会电视
Nothing, I'm just going to watch TV

271
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,330
这应该有个遥控器
There was a remote around here

272
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,730
你看到了吗？
Do you see it there?

273
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,730
你要看什么？
What are you gonna watch?

274
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,730
三傻就要开始了
3 Idiots is about to start

275
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,930
你看过了吗？
Have you seen it?

276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,430
是的，重播很多次了
Yeah, it's been broadcasted a lot

277
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,130
不过我还没看完整部电影
I haven't seen the whole movie though

278
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,430
什么，你还没看完整部电影吗？
What? you haven't seen the whole movie?

279
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,530
这是一部很棒的电影
It's a brilliant movie

280
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,230
高潮部分很棒，在迈德哈万和他爸爸之间有一个场景
The climax is awesome, There's a scene between Madhavan and his Dad

281
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,200
来，我给你看看现在是不是在播
Here, I'll show you if it's airing right now

282
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,530
你看过“丈夫，妻子和她”吗？
Have you seen "Husband, wife and her" ?

283
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,030
桑吉夫 · 库马尔的电影
Sanjeev Kumar's film

284
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,530
没有
Nope

285
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,730
这也是一部很棒的电影
It's a brilliant movie too

286
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,730
在影片中，桑吉夫 · 库马尔与其他女人有染
In the film sanjeev kumar has an affair with other woman

287
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,230
毁了他的生活
which sabotaged his life

288
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,330
你看过吗？
Have you seen it?

289
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
不，我没有
No I haven't

290
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,730
一定在经典频道播出，去看看
It must be airing on a classic channel, check it

291
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,530
没有，他们正在播放的是巴格班
Nope, They are showing Baghban here

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,730
现在只有广告
Right now it's just commercials

293
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,230
你为什么要看广告，换频道
Why are you watching the commercials, Change the channel

294
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,930
不，我只是注意到广告市场已经完全改变了
No, I'm just noticing that Ad world is completely changed now

295
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,630
它不再只是洗发水和发油的广告了
Its not only shampoo and hair oil ads anymore

296
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,730
现在有很多关于网站域名和智能手机应用程序的广告
There are a lot of commercials about website domains and smartphone apps these days

297
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,230
是的
Yeah

298
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,730
现在所有的事情都在互联网上完成
Everything's been done on Internet these days

299
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,730
甚至这些电影演员也做了很多与科技相关的广告
Even these movie actors are doing a lot of tech related ads

300
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,730
这些应用程序非常有用
These apps are very useful though

301
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,730
我早上就是通过一个应用程序预订了你的航班
I even booked your flight through an app in the morning

302
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,530
这些开发应用程序的公司最初被称为创业公司
These app generating companies are initially termed as "Startup"

303
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,730
在过去的7、8年里，人们已经变得更加精通技术
People have been more tech savvy since the last 7,8 years

304
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,730
那又怎样？
So what?

305
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,730
关于创业公司你想告诉我什么? 你以为我不知道吗？
What are you telling me about Startup? Don't I know about it?

306
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,730
不，电视上播放着一则广告，我就这么说一嘴……
No, there was an ad playing on the TV that's why..

307
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,730
你怕不是在创业公司工作吧？
Do you have a job offer from a startup?

308
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,730
那就是你下班后去的地方吗？
That's where you work post the office hours?

309
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,730
听着，不要轻信这些
Look, don't be gullible about it

310
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
大多数创业公司只是诱饵
Most startups are just decoys

311
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,730
他们不会给你钱，相反，他们会给你股份
They won't offer you any money, Instead they'll give you a share

312
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,330
如果公司在短短6个月内倒闭，你将如何处理这些股份？
What'll you do with the share if company shuts down in mere 6 months?

313
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,730
爸爸，事情不是这样的
That's not how it works Dad

314
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,730
事情就是这样的，你不用告诉我
That's exactly how it works. You don't have to tell me about it

315
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,730
萨蒂什的儿子也开了一家雨伞厂，但什么也没有得到。
Satish's son opened an umbrella factory too, nothing has come out of it.

316
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,730
我们不做雨伞
We're not making umbrellas

317
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,370
不管你做啥
Yeah whatever you're making

318
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,750
你能保证公司不会在6个月后倒闭吗？
Can you give me a guarantee that the company is not gonna terminate after 6 months?

319
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,920
不能去创业公司工作，明白吗？
Don't even think about working in a startup, okay?

320
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,730
你听到了吗？
Do you hear me?

321
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,230
是的
Yeah

322
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,730
你妈妈给了我一个歌曲下载列表，去下载吧
Your mom gave a list of songs to download, Get to that

323
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,730
现在就去
Go now

324
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,730
爸爸！
Dad!

325
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,730
事实上，他没有跟你说实情
Actually, he didn't tell you the whole thing

326
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,730
先生，你已经吃了7盘了
Sir, you've already eaten 7 plates

327
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,730
你在给我计数吗？
You're counting down this? huh?

328
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,730
我是创业者，你怎么敢这么说？
I'm a startup founder, how dare you?

329
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,530
这又不是你儿子的婚礼，快点，快点
It's not your son's wedding, keep 'em coming. chop chop

330
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,730
嘿 阿米特，兄弟，能帮个忙吗
Hey Amitesh bro, there's a problem

331
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,030
真扫兴
Oh! that's a bummer

332
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,630
还有其他人签名了吗？
Has anyone else signatured yet?

333
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,230
没有，但是每个人都在问同样的问题
No, but everyone's asking the same thing

334
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,730
这就是我来找你的原因
That's why I came to you

335
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,730
请您签个名好吗？
Can I have your signature please?

336
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,730
等我吃完这道甜菜，我就签字
Just let me finish this sweet dish then I'll sign on it

337
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,030
我两分钟后回来
I'll be back in 2 minutes

338
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,730
等一下
Just a minute

339
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,230
在找钢笔吗？
Looking for a pen?

340
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,730
不，我的电话在响，等一下
No, my phone is buzzing. Hold on

341
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,730
是卡鲁尼什，不好意思
Karunesh

342
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,730
是的，卡鲁尼什，是的，你说，是的
Yeah Karunesh, yeah speak up. Yeah

343
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,230
你面条吃没了？
You ran out of noodles?

344
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,730
你们能在这里签字吗？
Can you guys just sign here?

345
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,730
滚开，混蛋。
Beat it, asshole.

346
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,730
我告诉你，邪恶的眼神非常有用
I'm telling you evil eye beads are very useful

347
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,730
以前有个男孩经常骚扰我的表妹，我就是这样吓跑他的
Some boy used to harass my cousin sister and it helped

348
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,730
她是一个非常真诚的女孩，兄弟，她挂你电话是因为你说了很多脏话
She's a very sincere girl bro, your phone hangs because you use lot of profanity

349
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,730
滚出去
Get out of here

350
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,120
但你们不是……
But you guys are..

351
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,900
关心他人

352
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,230
滚
Beat it, fucker

353
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,130
什么，你做了煎蛋卷？
What? you made an Omelet?

354
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,730
天啊! 那些鸡蛋是我用来洗头的
Oh man! I brought those eggs to wash my hair with

355
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,730
你这个混蛋！
You jerk!

356
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,730
阿米特，签名吧，兄弟
Amitesh, Please sign it bro

357
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,730
天啊，我又要拉屎了
Oh man! I've to take a shit again

358
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,730
我想我拉肚子了，我马上回来，好吗？
I think I've diarrhea I'll be right back, okay?

359
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,730
是的，你说得对，今天就聊到这吧
Yeah you're right It's enough talking for the day

360
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,430
那啥，你想听首歌吗？
Listen, you wanna hear a song?

361
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,170
当然了，请记住

362
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,170
所有团队的介绍时间必须控制在五分钟之内
all team will has to end presentations in 5 mins

363
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,540
在正式评选开始之前……

for the xxx of the day, mr.Rajat Khanna

366
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,650
其实当他们找我当评委的时候
you know, when this guys approachies me to be the judge for this event

367
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,170
the first question i ask was……

368
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,750
我首先想到的就是……
the first question i ask was……

369
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:53,820
为什么要找我呢
why me？

370
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,070
请他们俩来我能理解，但是……
i mean i can understand why xxx and xxx, but……

371
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,200
我可不像他……
i'm not the CEO of...what

372
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,730
公司市值多少？4亿？
400 million dollar

373
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,350
再多一点
Just a little bit more

374
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,380
4亿市值公司的CEO
400 million dollar company like xxx

375
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,900
我也不是年轻有活力的运输业巨头公司高管
and i'm not the young and dynamic xxx transportion giant like uber

376
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
我们还是个初创公司
we still start up

377
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
而且我很抱歉我也不是吴彦祖
and i'm sorry i'm not xxx

378
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,060
但是他们说我是组织中重要的成员
so they said "no no, you've been a member of the xxx team"

379
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,570
我有责任为国家的发展做出贡献
so you're responsible for the expansion in all 50 countrys

380
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,300
我说是的，我是团队成员没错，但至于是不是重要成员
i said yes was certainly the member of the team, but xxx

381
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
只有我的董事长能告诉你
only my board director can tell you

382
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,300
我今天来这里

383
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
我今天来这里
you know, the real reason

384
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,420
真正的原因是在座的各位
i want to be here, and i'm here today, it's you guys

385
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
看看这个会场
i mean look at this, this is amazing

386
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,020
满满的都是创业人才
it makes my heart full of joy to see a room full of young xxx

387
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,020
大家正在掀起一场革命，可能你们都没有意识到
you know you guys are creating a revolution and you don't even know it

388
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:58,900
记住我的话

389
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,060
记住我的话
Mark my words

390
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:00,860
the face of this nation is going to be change

391
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,370
这个国家的面貌将会改变
the face of this nation is going to be change

392
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,670
不会因为政客而改变，也不会因为明星
not by politicians or stars

393
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,350
而是因为在座的各位
it's going to be change by you guys

394
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,730
没关系，至少我们试过了
It's alright man, atleast we tried

395
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,430
别这么消沉
Don't fret over it

396
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,430
我们要回去吗？
Should we go home?

397
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,630
如果我们现在出发，还能避开交通拥堵
We'll beat the traffic jam if we leave now

398
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,030
叫他闭嘴，尤吉
Tell him to zip it, Yogi

399
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,730
但是纳文这一次我同意他的观点
But Naveen for once I agree with him bro

400
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,730
我们已经受了够多苦
We've had enough of this shit

401
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,230
我们现在不应该在讲台上出丑
We shouldn't embarass ourselves on the stage now

402
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,730
回家吧
Let's go home now

403
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,730
不，尤吉
No Yogi

404
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,730
我们不能就这样放弃
We're not gonna leave it like this

405
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,230
我们为这个评审奋斗了这么久
We've been fighting for this competition for so long

406
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,230
我们再也不会在同一个屋檐下见到这么多金主了
We won't meet so many investors under one roof anytime again

407
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,730
我们必须上台
We have to get on the stage

408
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,730
但是我们在台上应该做什么呢？
But what shall we do on the stage?

409
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
你在这家创业公司的工作是什么？
What's your job in this startup?

410
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,730
编程
Coding

411
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,730
如果你要编程，那为什么要离开一个稳定的公司呢？
If you had to do coding then what's the point of leaving a well settled company?

412
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,030
爸爸，我不知道该怎么解释
Dad, I don't know how to explain

413
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,330
不，不，试着解释
No No try to explain

414
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,330
但你在解释的时候，请看着我的眼睛
But look into my eyes while explaining

415
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,730
爸爸，我的工作没有满足感
Dad, there's no job satisfaction

416
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,930
我不喜欢那些稳定的公司
I don't enjoy working in these companies

417
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,730
享受？
Enjoy?

418
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,730
工作是让你享受的吗？
Do you seek enjoyment by working?

419
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,730
我在银行工作了32年，是为了享受吗？
I've been working in a bank for 32 years, what? for enjoyment?

420
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,150
我必须管理别人的账户，为了什么? 为了享受？
I have to manage other people's accounts, what? for enjoyment?

421
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,400
你在每个月的第一天就能领工资
You get the salary on the 1st day of every month

422
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,730
这么好的工作，你有社保和公积金
You had such a good job, you had PFLT and all the company's amenities

423
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,730
即使这样你还是选择了出来创业？
Even after all that you decided to choose this?

424
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,370
好吧，忘记你犯的错误，继续前进
Alright forget the mistake that you've done and move on

425
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,320
你的简历很出色
You have a promising resume

426
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,550
重新申请一份新工作，一两个月后你就又上班了，好吗？
Start applying for a new job, you'll get one in a month or two, okay?

427
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,570
爸爸我已经..。
Dad, I've already...

428
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,400
好吗？
Okay?

429
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,370
不好，爸爸
Not okay Dad

430
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,920
他想继续创业
He wants to carry on with the startup

431
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,730
你们是一点都没听进去吧？
Aren't you guys getting anything?

432
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,730
如果公司做的不好或者创业失败了怎么办？
What if the company didn't succeed or the startup crashes. What then?

433
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
至少给他一次失败的机会，爸爸
Atleast give him a chance to fail, Dad

434
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,250
前面有一颗地雷，你却要我让他踩上去？
There's a landmine ahead, and you're asking me to let him step on that?

435
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,320
你考研的时候，我有个升职的机会在斋浦尔
When you were having your exams, I was offered a promotion in Jaipur

436
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,000
为了你的学业，我拒绝了升职
For the sake of your studies, I denied the promotion

437
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,650
我总是说，你想学多少就学多少
I have always said that study as much as you want

438
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,730
我来还贷款，我不会让你有任何的负担
I'll pay the loans but I won't let all the burden fall on you

439
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
为了你好，我不允许你这么做
I'm disallowing this for your own good

440
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,380
但是爸爸，你还要操多少心？
But Dad, for how long are you gonna be concerned?

441
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,500
作为父母，你所能做的就是让他做好准备
As a parent all you can do is prepare him

442
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,730
这样他才能为自己着想
So that he can think about his own good himself

443
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,170
你已经做到了
And you've done that

444
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,620
你可以传授学生知识，但学生必须自己参加考试
You can teach a student but he has to take the exam himself

445
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,420
好吧，看来我的话在这里没有任何意义
Alright then, it seems like my words have no meaning here

446
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,130
爸爸，你曾经还为了他的未来放弃了升职
Dad, even you took a risk of your promotion for his future

447
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,730
现在他为了自己的未来而辞职，至少要对他有信心
Now that he's leaving his job for his own future, atleast have faith in him

448
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,430
我对一家有25年历史的公司有信心
I have faith in a company which is 25 years old

449
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,000
但是你要我我怎么能相信一个由4个业余爱好者创建的创业公司
How can I trust a new company created by 4 amateurs

450
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,830
但是这个有25年历史的公司也是由3到4个业余爱好者创建的
But that 25 years old company was also created by some 3,4 amateurs

451
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,950
这家公司成立的那天，就有99家公司倒闭
And the day that company was created, another 99 companies were shut down

452
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,500
想想这概率，儿子
Probability Jeetu..

453
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,230
1%
1/100

454
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,730
如果你学过概率，那你应该能做出更明智的决定
If you had studied that chapter, your rank and decision both would've been better

455
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,570
爸爸，给他个机会

456
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
爸爸，别走

457
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,600
对不起

458
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
我没能说服他

459
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,150
嘿，你为什么哭？
Hey! why are you crying?

460
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,120
反正他也不会留下来
He wouldn't have stayed anyway

461
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,730
我不该说的
I shouldn't have said anything

462
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,120
好了，别哭了
Alright now please don't cry

463
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,100
对不起

464
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,600
你知道吗? 从来没有人像你一样为我挺身而出
You know what? No one has ever stood up for me like you did

465
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,730
你已经尽力了，亲爱的
You tried your best dear

466
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,530
你为什么说对不起？
Why are you saying sorry?

467
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,330
我应该谢谢你才对
Infact I should say thanks to you

468
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,150
我们的婚姻是包办的，所以我从来没有对你说过句话
We had an arranged marriage so I've never said this to you

469
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,730
我爱你
I love you

470
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,700
我也爱你
i love you too

471
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
抱歉我插一句
sorry for interrupting but...

472
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,060
我不能在你们app上买任何东西？
i can't not order xxx and xxx and anything else in the app?

473
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
不能
no, not even xxx

474
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
而且我为之骄傲
and i am proud of it

475
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,670
我们"枕头柳"只关注一样商品，那就是……
we here at pillow willow, are focusing only on one thing

476
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,400
枕头
pillows

477
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
至少接下来的三个季度是这样的
at least for next 3 Quarters

478
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
我们想要像flip cart一样
we want to be like flip card

479
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
但是只做枕头
but only for pillows

480
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,870
但是……
but uh...

481
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,570
flip cart 早就有枕头了，对吧？
flip card already has pillows right?

482
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,350
我想你的时间到了，谢谢
i guess that's all you can xxx thank you

483
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,020
谢谢大家
thank you xxx and team everyone

484
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,060
下面有请22号团队
next one we have team no.2

485
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,250
让我们欢迎
please welcome xxx and xxx

486
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,550
纳文团队
from i am in door

487
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,180
接下来的五分钟舞台归你们
guys the stage is yours for next 5 mins

488
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,300
大家好

489
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,350
我是纳文

490
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,770
你一小时前肯定见过我和我的团队成员
I'm sure you must have met me and my team members an hour ago

491
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,730
我们就是刚才到处乞求的人
We're the same guys who were like pleading, begging..

492
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,730
甚至可能还威胁了你
And in some cases even threatning you

493
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,730
只为在这张纸上签个名
To get one lousy signature on this page

494
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,380
可以让我们可以在舞台上讲述产品的说明
Which says it's okay for us to present our product on the stage

495
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,730
但是，如你所见，一个签名的都没有
But, as you can see, we didn't even come close

496
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,520
很抱歉
well I'm really sorry, but

497
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,120
恐怕我不能让你继续
i'm afraid i can't allow you to xxx

498
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,500
如果我允许你讲述你的产品，可能对其他团队就不公平了
it would't be fair to other team if i allow you to talk about your product

499
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
我们可以让下一组继续吗
so could we have the next team on stage please

500
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,820
你刚才说我不能谈论产品
but you said you're not allow us to talk product on stage

501
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,980
但是我还是能讲5分钟的吧
but i still have the 5 mins right？

502
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,720
行，那你还有四分三十秒
ok you have 4：30

503
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,600
我在美国有一些朋友
I have some friends in The United states

504
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,820
他们在硅谷工作
They work in the silicon valley

505
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,530
他们告诉我，每当一个企业家在那里创业... ..。
They told me that whenever an entrepreneur starts a startup there...

506
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,250
他们被问到的第一个问题是“什么? ”
The very first question they are being asked is "What?"

507
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,100
产品是什么？
What is the product?

508
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,730
而在印度，被问“什么”的可能性要小得多
And here in India "what" is far less likely, everyone asks "why?"

509
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,050
为什么要创业？
Why entrepreneurship?

510
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,730
今天我们面临着同样的挑战。
Today we are facing a similar challenge..

511
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,020
就好像没人愿意听我们的”什么? ”
Like nobody is willing to listen to our "what?"

512
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,730
那么让我来谈谈“为什么? ”
So let me talk about The "why?"

513
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,250
为什么要创业？
Why entrepreneurship?

514
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,330
我不知道
I don't know

515
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,100
也许是因为在公司工作的时候，老板的"祝福"让我感到沮丧
Maybe I was frustrated at my well wisher boss in a corporate job

516
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,130
或许我是受到了《华尔街之狼》和《社交网络》的启发
Or maybe I was inspired by "The Wolf Of wall street" and "The social network"

517
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,200
又或者也许我喜欢解决现实生活中的问题
Or maybe I enjoyed solving the real life problems

518
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,230
你们还记得吗，在90年代，我们常常在薯片包装袋里得到免费的tazos（类似小浣熊卡）？
Do you guys remember, in 90s when we used to get those free tazos inside a chips packet?

519
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,730
tazos是由塑料制成的，就像闪闪发光的圆盘，上面印着卡通图案
Circular tazos made up of plastic, like shining discs which had cartoons imprinted on them

520
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,430
我曾经喜欢的要命
I used to be like crazy about them

521
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,730
我想要无穷无尽的tazos
You know all I wanted was 100s and 100s of tazos

522
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,530
这样我就可以把它们储存在一个空的果酱瓶子里
So that I could store them in an empty bottle of fruit jam

523
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,730
但是我的零用钱每周只能买得起一包
But I could only afford 1 packet of chips a week from my pocket money

524
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,120
当我的朋友们已经有二三十个的时候，我只有5个
While my friends were piling on to 25-30 tazos, I could manage only 5

525
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,600
你们现在一定在想，这又有什么难的
You guys must be thinking right now that how trivial this problem is

526
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,730
但在那个时候，对于一个10岁的孩子来说，这真的很难很难
But at that time for a 10 years old kid, it was a huge life problem

527
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,730
而且这个问题亟待解决
And it needed to be solved

528
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,830
然后我有了个主意
and then I got an idea

529
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,370
有一天，我用一枚硬币把我所有的tazos都刮花了，直到它们变得完全是白色的
One day I scratched all of my tazos with a coin until they became completely white

530
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,320
第二天当我去上学的时候
The next day when I went to school

531
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,730
就有人说纳文有一些独特的空白tazos
A news had been spread that Naveen has some unique tazos, blank tazos

532
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,950
你可以在上面画任何你喜欢的卡通人物
On which you can draw any of your favourite cartoon character

533
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,650
突然间所有人都想要我的空白tazos
and suddenly everybody wanted it

534
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:53,020
同学们准备用他们的10个、15个甚至20个tazos去换一个我的空白tazos
People were ready to trade their 10,15 and even 20 tazos just to get that one special tazo

535
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,820
一个月后，我又去了那家商店
One month after that, I went to the shop again

536
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,930
但不是去买薯片
But not to buy a packet of chips

537
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,730
相反，我买了一瓶新的果酱
Instead I bought a new bottle of fruit jam

538
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,230
这是我人生中第一个商业模式
That was my life's first business model

539
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,830
在那之后，我进行了很多商业冒险
I executed a lot of business ventures after that

540
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,130
我曾经用电脑写CD，然后在学校里卖
I used to write CDs from my computer and sold them in school

541
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,730
在当地赞助商的帮助下，我在大学里设法出版了我的杂志
With the help of local sponsors I managed to print my magazine in college

542
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,370
但是现在和过去有很大的不同
But there's a huge difference between then and now

543
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,320
今天我很害怕
Today I'm scared

544
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,250
因为竞争非常残酷
Because the competition is very ruthless

545
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,930
你知道今天站在这里，我不觉得自己是一个企业家
You know standing here today, I don't feel like an entrepreneur

546
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,230
我觉得自己好像是一个真人秀的参赛者
I feel as if I'm a contestant in a reality show

547
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,780
我甚至在表演前就被淘汰了
and I'm being eliminated even before performing

548
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,530
实际上今天的评委,我曾经的老板拉杰先生用一句话
Actually today's judge my ex boss Mr Rajat khanna had summed up the competition..

549
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,730
总结了什么是竞争
in a very simple sentence

550
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,150
他说现在每个办公室的小隔间里都坐着一位创业者
He says that there's a startup founder sitting in every office cubicle these days

551
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,230
那么，在成千上万的企业家中，我的位置哪里呢？
Then where am I standing among those thousands of entrepreneurs?

552
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,730
现在我很怀疑我自己的能力
Now I'm dubious about my own capabilities you see

553
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,630
然后我想，我和这些成功的企业家有什么不同？
Then I thought that how am I different with all these successful entrepreneurs?

554
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,370
是什么特质让他们如此特别，而我却没有呢？
What makes them special that I don't have yet?

555
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,330
我有我的学历，我的智慧
I have my education, my wits

556
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,730
我有一支坚定支持我的团队
I have a team that stands resolutely behind me

557
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,730
所以，从技术上讲，我也应该是成功的，对吗？
So, technically I should be successful as well, right?

558
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,030
但也不一定
Well not necessarily

559
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,730
这些成功人士还有一个共同点
You know those guys had one more extra thing in common

560
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,230
这也许是最重要的一点
Which was perhaps the most crucial thing

561
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,730
他们拒绝放弃
They refused to give up

562
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,430
阅读任何企业家的自传
Read any entrepreneur's biography

563
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,130
里面充满了鸡汤
Its filled with phrases

564
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,300
就像在黑暗中与困难作斗争，探索未知领域
Like a shot in the dark fighting against the odds exploring uncharted territories

565
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,730
那么为什么在这么早的阶段就害怕失败呢？
Then why am I scared to fail at such an early stage?

566
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,430
没有人第一次就成功发明发动机
Nobody invented an engine their first time

567
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,430
没有人第一次就成功发现新大陆
Nobody discovered an Island their first time

568
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,730
但是他们不断尝试，不断去做
But they kept on trying, they kept on working

569
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,230
如果房间是黑暗的，你必须要开灯
If the room is dark and you have to light a bulb

570
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,930
如果你不断摸索总机上的开关
and if you kept fumbling the switches on the switchboard

571
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,730
总会有一个开关能点亮该死的灯泡
Then one of the switch will light the fucking bulb

572
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,730
甘地曾说过。
Gandhiji has said..

573
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,530
不管生活中出现什么问题，只有一个解决办法。
that whatever problem may come in life, there's only one solution..

574
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,530
干就完事了
Bow down and get to work

575
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,730
所有这些导师，天使投资人和活动
all these mentors, angel investors and events

576
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,730
我没有所有这些外部因素
I don't have all these external factors in my hands

577
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,530
我的手中就只有我的工作
All I have in my hands is my work

578
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,030
无论何时，只要有机会。
And whenever I'll get an opportunity..

579
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,730
我他妈的一定会成功的
I'll fucking ace it with my work

580
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,730
今天一个这样的机会就从我这里被夺走了
One such opportunity was being snatched from me today

581
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,870
我没有放弃
i didn't give up and run back

582
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,870
而是选择站在这里
but i choose to stand here to face you guys

583
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,400
因为我要抓住每一个机会
because ultra do not loose opportunities

584
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,930
拉杰，你告诉我，我不能在台上卖我的产品
Rajat you told me that I cannot sell my product here on stage

585
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,730
所以我卖自己
Therefore I sold myself

586
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,800
谢谢大家
thanks guys

587
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,420
thanks guys

588
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,030
你刚才真的没有必要装英雄
There was no need to become a hero there

589
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,230
每个人都喜欢拉杰
Everyone likes Rajat

590
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,130
你在舞台上狠狠地打他脸
And you bashed him on the stage

591
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,330
你知道你带来了多少负面宣传吗？
Do you know how much negative publicity you have generated?

592
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,330
至少是个宣传，反正也没人在乎我们
Atleast its a publicity No one was giving a shit about us anyway

593
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,730
事实上，宣传给我们带来了4张名片
Infact that publicity got us 4 visiting cards

594
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,730
所有的名片上都写着“打电话给我的秘书”
All the cards are the ones with "call my secretary" written on them

595
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,930
至少一个月之内我们都不会见面
We're not gonna get a meeting atleast before a month

596
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,400
至少比没有名片要好
Atleast its better than zero visiting cards

597
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,270
我谷歌了一下。
and I googled it..

598
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,730
甘地从来没说过“干就完事了”
Gandhiji never said "Bow down and get to work"

599
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,730
是啊，我不小心说错了
Yeah I mistakenly uttered that in a flow

600
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,030
真的吗，纳文? ，顺其自然？
Really Naveen? in a flow?

601
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,730
混蛋，这是你让别人给你口的时候才说的话吧
Fucker this is what you say when you're asking for a blowjob

602
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,730
不是的，如果你在一句引语前加上一个著名的人物，会产生双重影响
No man, It creates a double impact if you add a famous personality in front of a quote

603
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,730
你为什么笑得这么开心？
Why are you smiling so much?

604
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,230
你爸爸离开你家的时候很愤怒，你不担心吗？
Your Dad left your home outraged, Aren't you worried about it?

605
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,230
一点也不担心，我会去看他的
Not a tad worried, I'll see about that

606
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,730
你刚刚做爱了，对吧？
You just got laid, right?

607
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,050
想什么呢？尤吉，现在才晚上8点
What are you looking at Yogi? Its just 8 in the evening

608
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
纳文·巴萨尔

609
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,970
是我

610
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,970
你的演讲太棒了

611
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,970
你都上微博热搜了
social media is crazy about your video

612
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:39,330
每个创始人和风险投资家都在谈论你
Every founder and VC is talking about you

613
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,730
事实上，财政部长刚刚发了一条关于你的推特
Infact the finance minister just wrote a tweet about you

614
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,350
真的吗？
what？ really？

615
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,730
开个玩笑，没那么夸张
Just kidding, It wasn't that big a deal

616
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,730
但是，是的，有一篇文章专门报到你的故事
But yeah YourStory wrote an article about you a while ago

617
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,150
顺便说一嘴，我是普尼特，这是我的名片
by the way i'm Puneet i work for a vc firm, and this is my card

618
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,730
我在NASCOM上看到了你的想法
I saw your idea at NASCOM conclave

619
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,820
非常有趣
quiet interesting

620
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,600
你们有空来我办公室聊一聊吗
why don't you guys drop by my office sometimes

621
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,870
当然，求之不得
sure we love to

622
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,780
那你们给我秘书打电话吧
so call my secretary

623
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,450
我刚想起来
infact you know what, i

624
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,850
我星期四下午有空，你们星期四有时间吗？
I'm free on thursday afternoon, what are you guys doing on thursday?
