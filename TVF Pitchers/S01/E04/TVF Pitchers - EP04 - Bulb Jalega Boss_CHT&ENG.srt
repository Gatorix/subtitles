1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,600
融資的過程就好似一場摩訶婆羅多之戰
Getting a funding is equal to fighting the battle of Mahabharatha

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,700
我至少要佔股51%
I want atleast 51%

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,870
明天還有個活動，不會有潛在的投資者嗎？
Tomorrow, you have an event, won't there be potential investors?

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,250
我們冇時間了，史瑞雅
We are running out of time, Shreya

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,700
這麼說隻有你們三個？
So only 3 of you guys?

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,200
不，先生，我們有四個人，傑圖正在來的路上
No sir, we are four of us. Jeetu is on his way

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,320
餵，尤吉，我不能去了，我爸突然來我家了
Yogi i can't come, All of a sudden dad showed up!

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,820
等一下，傑圖
Wait a minute Jitu.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,320
回來坐下
Sit over here.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
真的非常抱歉，但這是我第四次告訴您
I'm really really sorry sir, but this is the fourth time i'm telling you

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,300
除非團隊人到齊了，否則我不能給你們通行證
that i can not give you the passes until the entire team registered

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,550
所以我們這樣，在你們的報價後麵……
So the amount which you guys had proposed?

13
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,300
加一個零
Suffix a zero to the number.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,050
我需要一個陪審室
I need a jury room.

15
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,620
兄弟們，不是這樣的，每次我在陪審室裏做出決定都是正確的
You know, whenever I've taken a decision in the jury room, it's always been right

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,500
他他媽的扔了一枚硬幣然後就定了
He fucking tosses a coin and decides.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,500
作出決定依據是拋硬幣的過程，而不是拋硬幣的結果
Decision was taken on the basis of tossing the coin, not on the result of it.

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,700
如果隻是因為錢，那我不能讓任何人控製我的野心
Just for more funding I can't let anyone control my ambitions.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,350
我們要去哪兒？
Where are we going ?

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,020
回去繼續參加活動
Back to the event.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,060
但是如果他們不讓我們進去呢
But what if they don't let us in!

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,170
那就用我們的一貫操作
The same thing what we always do ..

23
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,300
試試
Try.

24
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,150
我們做過的最厲害的事情就是冇放棄

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,730
爸爸，我剛給你煮了咖啡
Dad, I just made you some coffee

26
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,250
我去幫你拿
Let me get it for you

27
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,230
不用，你坐下
No No, Just sit down

28
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,730
傑圖剛剛還在這裏
Jeetu was just right here

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,950
我打了30分鍾的瞌睡
I dozed off for 30 minutes

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,730
他就不見了
and he is nowhere to be seen

31
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,530
他告訴你他去哪兒了嗎？
Did he tell you where he has gone?

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,230
冇有，但他一定就在附近
No but he must be around the block

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,630
他馬上就回來
He'll be back in a jiffy

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,730
是嗎？
Oh yeah?

35
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,730
他通常什麼時候從辦公室回家？
when does he usually get back home from the office?

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,730
大概在晚上7點到7:30
almost by 7PM or 7:30 PM

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,730
但是門衛告訴我，他晚上一般兩三點鍾回來
But watchman told me that he usually gets back by 2 or 3 in the night

38
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,630
有時候他第二天早上才回來
and sometimes he'd get back next day in the morning

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,530
是的，有時候
yeah sometimes

40
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,730
但他會提前打電話告訴我他會晚點回家
But he tells me beforehand on the phone if he's gonna be home late

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,730
是嗎？
oh really?

42
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,730
你能從電話裏看出他是在辦公室裏說話嗎？
can you tell from the phone that he's speaking from the office?

43
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,430
他可能是從任何地方打來的
He could be calling from anywhere

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,730
什麼意思
I don't follow

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,330
我從網上查到了他的公司
Look, I took the contact number from the website

46
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,730
給他的公司打了電話
and called his company

47
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,530
他們告訴我那個辦公室已經關門兩天了
They told me that office has been closed for two days

48
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,330
你知道這兩天他去哪兒了嗎？
Now do you know where he's been for last 2 days?

49
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,730
我不知道，爸爸
Umm No Dad

50
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,730
桑亞……
Soumya...

51
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,730
你和他……
You and him...

52
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,530
相處得很好，對嗎？
are getting along with each other, right?

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,730
當然了，爸爸，但是……
Ofcourse Dad but...

54
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,530
但是您要說什麼？
But what's the matter?

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,730
不，冇什麼
No It's nothing

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,530
問題是他才26歲
Thing is that he's just 26 years old

57
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,730
我們不知道他和誰有聯係
we don't know who he's been associating with

58
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,430
你這樣
Do one thing..

59
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,230
看好他
Keep an eye on him

60
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,730
監控他的手機，信用卡和賬單
Monitor his phones, credit cards and bills

61
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,930
檢查他衣服上的唇印，如果有的話
Check for the lipstick marks on his clothes, if any

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,230
哦，是的……
oh yes and..

63
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,930
切一些洋蔥和香菜葉
Chop some onion and coriander leaves

64
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,630
然後放進蔬菜裏。
and put it in the vegetable..

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,830
再煮5分鍾
and cook for 5 more minutes

66
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,230
傑圖的媽媽就是這麼做的
Jeetu's mom follows the same recipe

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,730
你去哪兒了，孩子？
So Where were you, Son?

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,730
哦，我隻是在外麵慢跑
Oh I was just jogging outside

69
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,730
穿人字拖跑？
In flip flops?

70
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,330
其實我跑得很慢
I.. I was running at a slow pace actually

71
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,630
下次盡量快一點
Try at a fast pace next time

72
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,330
好了，現在把你的手機給我
Alright now give me your phone

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,730
我得給你阿姨打個電話
I have to call your Aunt

74
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,730
我給她打吧？
Why don't I call her?

75
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,230
我已經很久冇和她說過話了
It's been a long time since I've spoken to her

76
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,930
那好吧
Okay, very well then

77
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,730
那你給她打電話
You call her then

78
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,730
用傑圖的手機打給她，然後跟我聊聊她最近怎樣
Call her from Jeetu's phone and tell me how's she doing

79
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,730
我在外麵看報紙
I'll be out here reading newspaper

80
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,330
我不能再這麼做了
I can't do this anymore

81
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,530
為什麼? 發生什麼了？
Why? What happened?

82
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,730
他以為你外麵有人了
He thinks that you're having a love affair with someone

83
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,730
讓我監視你
He was asking me to spy on you

84
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,230
這都是因為那個白癡門衛
this is all because of that moronic watchman

85
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,730
我要寫一份開除他的請願書
gotta write a petition for his expulsion

86
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,430
而且納文和隊友們最近發生了很多事
Also Naveen and team has been going through a lot lately

87
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,230
到晚上我們就會知道該怎麼走下一步了
We'll know by the evening what we're gonna do with the startup

88
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,730
你真的冇有外遇，對嗎？
Umm you're really not having an affair. right?

89
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,730
桑亞你怎麼……
Soumya What the...

90
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,730
我都已經跟不上工作的節奏了而你卻在談論外遇？
I can't even keep up with my job here and you're taking about affair?

91
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,730
那你為什麼不告訴爸爸？
Then why don't you tell this to Dad?

92
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,730
你辭職了，加入了創業公司。
That you've left the job and about this startup..

93
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,230
現在還不是時候
It's not the right time yet

94
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,230
那要等到什麼時候？
So, when it's gonna be?

95
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,730
他遲早會知道的
He's gonna know about it one way or another

96
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,330
通過辦公室或者門衛，或者從其他地方
Through Office or by watchman or maybe from some other place

97
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,730
你最好自己告訴他
it's better that you tell him about it yourself

98
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,530
夥計們，我不是開玩笑
Guys I'm not joking

99
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,630
我媽媽過去常常親吻我的額頭以求好運
My mom used to kiss me on my forehead for luck

100
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,530
我每次考試都成功了
and it worked every time in my exams

101
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,430
我們的額頭上有一個神聖的紫色脈輪
We have a sacred purple chakra in our forehead

102
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,730
我告訴你，我們一直被壞運氣束縛著
I'm telling you, we've been girdled by bad luck

103
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,630
有人吻我的額頭，一切都會好起來的
Someone kiss me on my forehead, everything will be alright

104
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,730
等等，曼達爾，我們得先找到評委
Hold up Mandal, We gotta find the judges first

105
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,730
你知道我怎麼想的嗎？
You know what I think?

106
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,730
把其他人都放在一邊，讓我們把註意力集中在 納拉揚·默西 (INFOSYS 的創始人)身上
Leave everyone else aside and let's focus on Narayan Murthy(founder of INFOSYS*)

107
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,730
聽著，我不在乎進入或許可
Look, I don't care about entry or permission

108
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,630
但是我要讓那個婊子阿波娃付出代價！ 納文！
but I'm going to make that bitch Apoorva pay for what she did to us 86 00:05:025,000 --> 00:05:26,500 Hey Yogi! Naveen!

109
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,730
嘿，阿米特什！
Hey Amitesh!

110
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,730
你怎麼樣，混蛋？
How're you doing fucker?

111
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,730
我很好，你呢？
I'm well and good. How about you?

112
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,730
你吃午飯了嗎？
Did you have the lunch yet?

113
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,730
還冇有，兄弟
Not yet bro

114
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,630
夥計，你錯過了最好的黃油雞肉
Man, you're missing out on the best butter chicken out there

115
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,730
我已經吃了6盤了
I've already eaten 6 plates

116
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,730
現在快去排隊吧，他們隻剩這麼多了
Get in the line now, they only have so much left

117
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,030
但你他媽的在這裏幹什麼？
But what the fuck are you doing here?

118
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,730
你也創建了一個創業公司嗎？
Did you create a startup too?

119
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,730
你能幫我拿一下嗎？
Can you hold this for me?

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,730
小心糕點
Watch out for the pastry

121
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,730
什麼，你說什麼？
What? what did you say?

122
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,330
每個星期天都有一個活動或者峰會
Every Sunday there's an Event or E summit

123
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,730
我註冊隻是為了來這吃雞肉
And I just register only to gulp a lot of chicken

124
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,230
看，我甚至給了他們一個提示
Look, I even give them a hint

125
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,730
Petpooja.com (* Hungerlust.com)
petpooja.com (*Hungerlust.com)

126
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,730
但是一直冇有人知道我的詭計
But still no one has come to know about my shenanigans

127
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,230
那你呢？
What about you though?

128
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,730
你們的創業理念是什麼？
What's the idea of your startup?

129
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,730
我們可能會在臺上展示我們的想法
we're presenting our idea on the stage most likely

130
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,430
到時你就知道了
Then you'll know

131
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,730
還等什麼? 現在就告訴我
Why so closemouthed about it? Tell me now

132
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,730
好吧，我們的想法是..。
Okay, so the idea is...

133
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,730
如果我現在告訴你，不會降低你的期望值嗎？
Won't it lower your anticipation if I told you now?

134
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,730
大學畢業後你一點都冇變
you haven't changed a bit since college

135
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,230
冇有人比你更戲劇化了
No one could be more melodramatic than you

136
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,530
好吧，就讓它成為一個謎吧
alright let it be a mystery then

137
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,430
傑圖在哪兒？
Where the hell is Jeetu?

138
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,730
那個混蛋在家裏，就是因為他，我們才落得如此地步
The fucker's at home, it's because of him that we're in such abyss

139
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,730
是嗎？
oh really?

140
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,730
是啊
yeah

141
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,830
我們現在得和評委談談
We have to talk to the judges now

142
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,530
納拉揚·穆西來了嗎？
Is Narayan Murthy here yet?

143
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,730
他在最後一刻退出了這場活動
He abandoned the event at the last moment

144
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,630
因此，活動工作人員現在已經找到了一個新的替代者
So the event staff has seeked a new replacement now

145
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,130
我聽說他是一個資深的、經驗豐富的人
I've heard that he's a doyen and very experienced man

146
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:57,730
我剛才在這附近看到他了
I just saw him around here somewhere

147
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,330
是的，就是他
Yeah, that's him

148
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,530
穿著黑色西裝
In the black suit

149
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,730
我想不起他的名字了。
I can't recollect his name..

150
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,330
哦，是的，拉傑 · 卡納
Oh yes Rajat Khanna

151
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,730
莫卡特孟買分部負責人
Head of Mokart's Mumbai branch

152
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,730
你是要去親他嗎？？？
Do you want the kiss here or in the bathroom?

153
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,930
已經兩個小時了，還是鎖著的
It's been 2 hours but no one's bothering to unlock this thing

154
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,730
今年的女性參會人數都破紀錄了
women have a record participation this year

155
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,730
5位女企業家，竟然這樣
5 Female entrepreneurs and this?

156
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,730
我跟你講，性別歧視也要有個限度
I tell you there has to be a limit to gender discrimination

157
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,930
我是說它無處不在
I mean it's everywhere

158
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,730
在商界，體育界，電影界
In business, in sports, in films

159
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,430
你知道貝克德爾測試嗎？
Do you know about the Bechdel test?

160
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,530
不知道
No

161
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,730
來吧，我告訴你來
Come, I'll tell you come

162
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,730
他認識你，試著和他談談
He knows you, try talking to him

163
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,330
老哥，我為了辦這家公司打亂了他的計畫
Dude, I stomped over his project to start this startup

164
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,730
不可能的
There's no chance

165
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,730
收到
Roger that

166
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,230
兩分鍾後見
See you in two

167
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,530
一切都準備好了
Everything is set

168
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,730
15分鍾後我們就能拿到通行證了
We'll be holding the passes in our hands in next 15 minutes

169
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,530
什麼，怎麼做到的？
What? how?

170
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,530
我隻是花了一些時間在人類最具創造力的椅子上
I just spent some time on mankind's most creative chair

171
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,330
我充分利用了它
And I made good use of it

172
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,430
我有3個驚人的計劃來參加這個比賽
I have 3 amazing plans to enter this competition

173
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,430
尤吉，別搞那些花裏胡哨的
Yogi no violence, no kidnapping

174
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,430
我有一個參加比賽的絕妙計劃
I have 1 amazing plan to enter the competition

175
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,930
聽我說，這是萬無一失的
Hear me out, It's foolproof

176
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,730
計劃是這樣的
Here's the plan

177
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,030
你們以為自己了解所有的總體規劃，對嗎？
You guys think that you've heard all the masterplans before, right?

178
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,430
但你們不知道我的
But not mine

179
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,530
有些計劃是有效的，有些計劃是機智的
Some plans are effective, some plans are brilliant

180
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,730
我的兩者都是
Mine is both

181
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,430
5分鍾後，阿波娃會在接待處接到一個電話
Right after 5 minutes, Apoorva will recieve a call on the reception

182
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,230
她會到外麵去接電話
In order to attend it, she'll go outside

183
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,230
此時曼達爾用氣球擋住監控攝像頭
Mandal will then block the CCTV by balloons

184
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,630
然後我來轉移註意力
And then my diversion

185
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,730
什麼? 是真的嗎？
What? Is that true?

186
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,730
夥計們，有人看到薩欽在外麵
Guys, Sachin was just spotted outside

187
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,730
不是薩欽·德魯卡，是薩欽·班薩（印度富豪）
Not Sachin Tendulkar you morons, Sachin Bansal

188
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,130
最後納文要做的是
Finally, all Naveen has to do

189
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,730
把傑圖的頭像換成別人的
is replace Jeetu's face on our company's profile with somebody else's

190
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,730
就是我們今天的假傑圖
And that guy will be our fake Jeetu for a day

191
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,730
等下
NO no no no

192
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,730
你要上傳誰的照片來取代傑圖？
Whose photo are you gonna upload in place of Jeetu's?

193
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,730
我們需要一個假的傑圖
We need a fake Jeetu beforehand

194
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,630
計劃很簡單，納文
Plan is foolproof Naveen

195
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
我們我們已經有第四個人了
We have the 4th guy

196
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,730
我剛雇傭了我們的第一個實習生
I've just hired our first intern

197
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,730
他來了
Oh! and he's here

198
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,730
鑰匙在腳墊下麵
The key is under the doormat

199
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,830
老子能活一百
Live Long Suckers

200
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,730
讓我們為恰恰鼓掌
Let's give it up for ChaCha

201
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,730
尤吉，我不太確定，兄弟
Yogi, I'm not so sure bro

202
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,730
你有更好的計劃嗎？
Do you have a better plan?

203
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,730
那麼來吧，我們開始吧
Then come on guys lets do this

204
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,730
你為什麼把氣球拿進去？
Why are you taking the balloons inside?

205
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,730
今天是我兒子的生日
It.. it's my son's birthday

206
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,230
你兒子是誰？
who is your son?

207
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,730
納文
Naveen

208
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,730
這裏冇有納文
There's no Naveen here

209
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,730
你這氣球裏麵藏了什麼？
What are you smuggling inside them?

210
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,730
我要報警了
I'm calling the police

211
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,430
我不想再被關進監獄了
I don't want to get locked behind the bars again

212
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,730
負責人，報警
Organizer, call the ploice

213
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,730
等等，等等
Whoa hold on hold on

214
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,730
他跟我一起的，發生什麼事了？
He's with me what happened?

215
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,730
他為什麼把氣球帶到這裏來？
Why is he bringing the balloons in here?

216
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,130
你們又來了？
You guys again?

217
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,730
保安，請他們出去，他們已經煩了我好幾個小時了
Security, please escort them out of here They have been bugging me for hours

218
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,730
這是怎麼回事？
What's going on here?

219
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,730
怎... 怎麼了？
Wha.. what's the problem?

220
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,730
納文？
Naveen?

221
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,550
你們應該早點來找我的
You guys have been here since morning You should've come to me earlier

222
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,030
剛才那是在搞什麼？
What the hell was that out there?

223
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,730
先生，通行證準備好了
Sir, the passes sir

224
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,330
我真的很抱歉，我不知道你認識他們
I'm really sorry I didn' know that you know them

225
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,330
就算我不認識他們
Even if I didn't know them

226
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,430
你怎麼能阻止別人參加比賽？
How dare you stop people from entering the competition?

227
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,480
非常抱歉，先生

228
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,330
非常抱歉，先生
i'm really sorry sir

229
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
他們不是已經在網站上註冊了嗎？
Haven't they already registered on the website?

230
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,780
他們還冇有準備好産品嗎？
Don't they have a product ready?

231
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,530
是的，先生，我真的很抱歉
They do sir, i'm really sorry

232
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,330
所以我覺得你應該和管理層談談讓她滾蛋
So I think you should talk to the management and get her fired

233
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,730
是的，就該這樣，不是嗎？
Yeah we should. shouldn't we?

234
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,730
這樣就不會有別的隊伍因為一個微不足道的規則而被取消比賽資格
So that more teams don't get disqualified for a trivial rule

235
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,730
冇關係，先生，她隻是在做她的工作
It's okay sir, she was just doing her job

236
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,380
非常感謝您
thank you so much sir

237
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,730
如果我們能報答你的恩惠
If we can ever return your favour

238
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,730
實際上我叔叔是 LIC 的代理人
Actually my uncle is an LIC agent

239
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,530
如果你需要免費保險，這是我的名片
If you ever need a free insurance policy, here's my card

240
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,730
不用了，謝謝你
it's ok

241
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,050
你們工作這麼努力，這是我能為我的前雇員做的最起碼的事
You guys have worked so hard, this is the least I could do for My ex employee

242
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,730
非常感謝，能遇到你真的很幸運
Thanks a lot, lucky for us that you were here

243
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,730
這點我同意
That I would agree with

244
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,730
隻有一件小事
Just one small thing

245
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,930
有些人可能會誤會，因為我在開始前就跟你們見麵了
Some people might feel that because I know you from before I'm allowing you to participate

246
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,730
然而這裏禁止發生有爭議的事情，會影響我的形象
So, god forbids if there's a controversy to follow, making me a bad person

247
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,230
你們能不能讓其他團隊簽一份說明讓他們同意你參賽
Can you just get the other teams to sign on a paper That they're okay with you participating

248
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,730
其他團隊? ，所有其他團隊嗎？
Others as in? all the other teams?

249
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,730
對的，應該不會超過半小時
yeah, it shouldn't take more than half an hour

250
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,480
而且他們現在肯定在吃午飯
Plus they must be having lunch right now

251
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,830
我不想讓其他隊伍覺得評委有偏見，懂我的意思吧？
See, I don't want the other teams to feel that the judges are biased, right?

252
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,730
所以，為了安全起見，去找大家簽名吧
So, just for safety please get the signatures

253
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:54,230
好嗎，其他評委在等，我我得走了
Okay? okay the other judges are waiting for me I gotta go

254
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,730
但是拉傑，如果我們拿不到簽名怎麼辦？
But Rajat, what if we don't get the signatures?

255
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,130
冇有其他團隊的同意，我不能讓你上臺演講，納文
Without the other teams' consent I can't allow you to talk about your product Naveen

256
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:11,230
納文，你知道我的風格
Naveen you know me

257
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,730
無論規則多麼瑣碎，但我還是願意遵守
However trivial the rules are you know I always like to follow them

258
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,730
活動就要開始了
The event's gonna start

259
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,730
請拿到簽名
Please get the signatures

260
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,530
是的，我今晚就到
Yes I'm getting there tonight

261
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,130
不，我還冇走
No I haven't left yet

262
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,730
我會在晚上8點出發
I'll leave by 8PM

263
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
不是啊，為什麼我明天早上才到？
No, why would I reach the next morning?

264
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,730
不會的，我今晚就到
I won't be late, I'll be there tonight

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,200
我不坐火車了
I won't be taking train

266
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,730
傑圖給我訂了一張機票
Jeetu booked me a flight ticket

267
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,470
是的，他最近升職了
Yes, he just got a promotion

268
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,730
好吧，我晚點再跟你說
Alright man, I'll talk to you later

269
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,730
怎麼了？
What happened?

270
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,230
冇什麼，我隻是想看會電視
Nothing, I'm just going to watch TV

271
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,330
這應該有個遙控器
There was a remote around here

272
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,730
你看到了嗎？
Do you see it there?

273
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,730
你要看什麼？
What are you gonna watch?

274
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,730
三傻就要開始了
3 Idiots is about to start

275
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,930
你看過了嗎？
Have you seen it?

276
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,430
是的，重播很多次了
Yeah, it's been broadcasted a lot

277
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,130
不過我還冇看完整部電影
I haven't seen the whole movie though

278
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,430
什麼，你還冇看完整部電影嗎？
What? you haven't seen the whole movie?

279
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,530
這是一部很棒的電影
It's a brilliant movie

280
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,230
高潮部分很棒，在邁德哈萬和他爸爸之間有一個場景
The climax is awesome, There's a scene between Madhavan and his Dad

281
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,200
來，我給你看看現在是不是在播
Here, I'll show you if it's airing right now

282
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,530
你看過“丈夫，妻子和她”嗎？
Have you seen "Husband, wife and her" ?

283
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,030
桑吉夫 · 庫馬爾的電影
Sanjeev Kumar's film

284
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,530
冇有
Nope

285
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,730
這也是一部很棒的電影
It's a brilliant movie too

286
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,730
在影片中，桑吉夫 · 庫馬爾與其他女人有染
In the film sanjeev kumar has an affair with other woman

287
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,230
毀了他的生活
which sabotaged his life

288
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,330
你看過嗎？
Have you seen it?

289
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
不，我冇有
No I haven't

290
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,730
一定在經典頻道播出，去看看
It must be airing on a classic channel, check it

291
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,530
冇有，他們正在播放的是巴格班
Nope, They are showing Baghban here

292
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,730
現在隻有廣告
Right now it's just commercials

293
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,230
你為什麼要看廣告，換頻道
Why are you watching the commercials, Change the channel

294
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,930
不，我隻是註意到廣告市場已經完全改變了
No, I'm just noticing that Ad world is completely changed now

295
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,630
它不再隻是洗發水和發油的廣告了
Its not only shampoo and hair oil ads anymore

296
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,730
現在有很多關於網站域名和智能手機應用程序的廣告
There are a lot of commercials about website domains and smartphone apps these days

297
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,230
是的
Yeah

298
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,730
現在所有的事情都在互聯網上完成
Everything's been done on Internet these days

299
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,730
甚至這些電影演員也做了很多與科技相關的廣告
Even these movie actors are doing a lot of tech related ads

300
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,730
這些應用程序非常有用
These apps are very useful though

301
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,730
我早上就是通過一個應用程序預訂了你的航班
I even booked your flight through an app in the morning

302
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,530
這些開發應用程序的公司最初被稱為創業公司
These app generating companies are initially termed as "Startup"

303
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,730
在過去的7、8年裏，人們已經變得更加精通技術
People have been more tech savvy since the last 7,8 years

304
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,730
那又怎樣？
So what?

305
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,730
關於創業公司你想告訴我什麼? 你以為我不知道嗎？
What are you telling me about Startup? Don't I know about it?

306
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,730
不，電視上播放著一則廣告，我就這麼說一嘴……
No, there was an ad playing on the TV that's why..

307
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,730
你怕不是在創業公司工作吧？
Do you have a job offer from a startup?

308
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,730
那就是你下班後去的地方嗎？
That's where you work post the office hours?

309
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,730
聽著，不要輕信這些
Look, don't be gullible about it

310
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
大多數創業公司隻是誘餌
Most startups are just decoys

311
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,730
他們不會給你錢，相反，他們會給你股份
They won't offer you any money, Instead they'll give you a share

312
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,330
如果公司在短短6個月內倒閉，你將如何處理這些股份？
What'll you do with the share if company shuts down in mere 6 months?

313
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,730
爸爸，事情不是這樣的
That's not how it works Dad

314
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,730
事情就是這樣的，你不用告訴我
That's exactly how it works. You don't have to tell me about it

315
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,730
薩蒂什的兒子也開了一家雨傘廠，但什麼也冇有得到。
Satish's son opened an umbrella factory too, nothing has come out of it.

316
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:11,730
我們不做雨傘
We're not making umbrellas

317
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,370
不管你做啥
Yeah whatever you're making

318
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,750
你能保證公司不會在6個月後倒閉嗎？
Can you give me a guarantee that the company is not gonna terminate after 6 months?

319
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,920
不能去創業公司工作，明白嗎？
Don't even think about working in a startup, okay?

320
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,730
你聽到了嗎？
Do you hear me?

321
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,230
是的
Yeah

322
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,730
你媽媽給了我一個歌麯下載列錶，去下載吧
Your mom gave a list of songs to download, Get to that

323
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,730
現在就去
Go now

324
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,730
爸爸！
Dad!

325
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,730
事實上，他冇有跟你說實情
Actually, he didn't tell you the whole thing

326
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,730
先生，你已經吃了7盤了
Sir, you've already eaten 7 plates

327
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,730
你在給我計數嗎？
You're counting down this? huh?

328
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,730
我是創業者，你怎麼敢這麼說？
I'm a startup founder, how dare you?

329
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,530
這又不是你兒子的婚禮，快點，快點
It's not your son's wedding, keep 'em coming. chop chop

330
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,730
嘿 阿米特，兄弟，能幫個忙嗎
Hey Amitesh bro, there's a problem

331
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,030
真掃興
Oh! that's a bummer

332
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,630
還有其他人簽名了嗎？
Has anyone else signatured yet?

333
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,230
冇有，但是每個人都在問同樣的問題
No, but everyone's asking the same thing

334
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,730
這就是我來找你的原因
That's why I came to you

335
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,730
請您簽個名好嗎？
Can I have your signature please?

336
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,730
等我吃完這道甜菜，我就簽字

337
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,030

I'll be back in 2 minutes

338
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,730
等一下
Just a minute

339
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,230
在找鋼筆嗎？
Looking for a pen?

340
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,730
不，我的電話在響，等一下
No, my phone is buzzing. Hold on

341
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,730
是卡魯尼什，不好意思

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,730
是的，卡魯尼什，是的，你說，是的
Yeah Karunesh, yeah speak up. Yeah

343
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,230
你麵條吃冇了？
You ran out of noodles?

344
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,730
你們能在這裏簽字嗎？
Can you guys just sign here?

345
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,730
滾開，混蛋。

346
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,730
我告訴你，邪惡的眼神非常有用
I'm telling you evil eye beads are very useful

347
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,730
以前有個男孩經常騷擾我的錶妹，我就是這樣嚇跑他的
Some boy used to harass my cousin sister and it helped

348
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,730
她是一個非常真誠的女孩，兄弟，她掛你電話是因為你說了很多髒話
She's a very sincere girl bro, your phone hangs because you use lot of profanity

349
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,730
滾出去

350
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,120
但你們不是……
But you guys are..

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,900

滾

353

什麼，你做了煎蛋卷？
What? you made an Omelet?

354
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,730
天啊! 那些雞蛋是我用來洗頭的
Oh man! I brought those eggs to wash my hair with

355
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,730

天啊，我又要拉屎了
Oh man! I've to take a shit again

358
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,730

Yeah you're right It's enough talking for the day

360
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,430

其實當他們找我當評委的時候
you know, when this guys approachies me to be the judge for this event

367
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,170

368
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,750
我首先想到的就是……
the first question i ask was……

369
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:53,820
為什麼要找我呢
why me？

370
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,070
請他們倆來我能理解，但是……
i mean i can understand why xxx and xxx, but……

371
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,200
我可不像他……
i'm not the CEO of...what

372
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,730
公司市值多少？4億？
400 million dollar

373
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,350
再多一點
Just a little bit more

374
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,380
4億市值公司的CEO
400 million dollar company like xxx

375
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,900
我也不是年輕有活力的運輸業巨頭公司高管
and i'm not the young and dynamic xxx transportion giant like uber

376
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,900
我們還是個初創公司
we still start up

377
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
而且我很抱歉我也不是吳彥祖
and i'm sorry i'm not xxx

378
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,060
但是他們說我是組織中重要的成員
so they said "no no, you've been a member of the xxx team"

379
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,570
我有責任為國家的發展做出貢獻
so you're responsible for the expansion in all 50 countrys

380
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:36,300
我說是的，我是團隊成員冇錯，但至於是不是重要成員
i said yes was certainly the member of the team, but xxx

381
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
隻有我的董事長能告訴你
only my board director can tell you

382
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:40,300
我今天來這裏

387
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:58,020
大家正在掀起一場革命，可能你們都冇有意識到
you know you guys are creating a revolution and you don't even know it

388
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:58,900

389
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,060

the face of this nation is going to be change

391
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,370
這個國家的麵貌將會改變
the face of this nation is going to be change

392
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,670
不會因為政客而改變，也不會因為明星
not by politicians or stars

393
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,350
而是因為在座的各位
it's going to be change by you guys

394
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,730
冇關係，至少我們試過了
It's alright man, atleast we tried

395
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,430
別這麼消沈
Don't fret over it

396
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,430
我們要回去嗎？
Should we go home?

397
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,630
如果我們現在出發，還能避開交通擁堵
We'll beat the traffic jam if we leave now

398
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,030
叫他閉嘴，尤吉
Tell him to zip it, Yogi

399
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,730
但是納文這一次我同意他的觀點
But Naveen for once I agree with him bro

400
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,730
我們已經受了夠多苦
We've had enough of this shit

401
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,230
我們現在不應該在講臺上出醜
We shouldn't embarass ourselves on the stage now

402
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,730
回家吧
Let's go home now

403
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,730
不，尤吉
No Yogi

404
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,730
我們不能就這樣放棄
We're not gonna leave it like this

405
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,230
我們為這個評審奮鬥了這麼久
We've been fighting for this competition for so long

406
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,230
我們再也不會在同一個屋簷下見到這麼多金主了
We won't meet so many investors under one roof anytime again

407
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:10,730
我們必須上臺
We have to get on the stage

408
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,730
但是我們在臺上應該做什麼呢？
But what shall we do on the stage?

409
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
你在這家創業公司的工作是什麼？
What's your job in this startup?

410
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,730
編程
Coding

411
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,730
如果你要編程，那為什麼要離開一個穩定的公司呢？
If you had to do coding then what's the point of leaving a well settled company?

412
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,030
爸爸，我不知道該怎麼解釋
Dad, I don't know how to explain

413
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,330
不，不，試著解釋
No No try to explain

414
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,330
但你在解釋的時候，請看著我的眼睛
But look into my eyes while explaining

415
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,730
爸爸，我的工作冇有滿足感
Dad, there's no job satisfaction

416
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,930
我不喜歡那些穩定的公司
I don't enjoy working in these companies

417
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,730
享受？
Enjoy?

418
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,730
工作是讓你享受的嗎？
Do you seek enjoyment by working?

419
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,730
我在銀行工作了32年，是為了享受嗎？
I've been working in a bank for 32 years, what? for enjoyment?

420
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,150
我必須管理別人的賬戶，為了什麼? 為了享受？
I have to manage other people's accounts, what? for enjoyment?

421
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,400
你在每個月的第一天就能領工資
You get the salary on the 1st day of every month

422
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:05,730
這麼好的工作，你有社保和公積金
You had such a good job, you had PFLT and all the company's amenities

423
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,730
即使這樣你還是選擇了出來創業？
Even after all that you decided to choose this?

424
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,370
好吧，忘記你犯的錯誤，繼續前進
Alright forget the mistake that you've done and move on

425
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,320
你的簡曆很出色
You have a promising resume

426
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,550
重新申請一份新工作，一兩個月後你就又上班了，好嗎？
Start applying for a new job, you'll get one in a month or two, okay?

427
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,570
爸爸我已經..。
Dad, I've already...

428
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,400
好嗎？
Okay?

429
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,370
不好，爸爸
Not okay Dad

430
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,920
他想繼續創業
He wants to carry on with the startup

431
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,730
你們是一點都冇聽進去吧？
Aren't you guys getting anything?

432
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,730
如果公司做的不好或者創業失敗了怎麼辦？
What if the company didn't succeed or the startup crashes. What then?

433
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
至少給他一次失敗的機會，爸爸
Atleast give him a chance to fail, Dad

434
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,250
前麵有一顆地雷，你卻要我讓他踩上去？
There's a landmine ahead, and you're asking me to let him step on that?

435
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,320
你考研的時候，我有個升職的機會在齋浦爾
When you were having your exams, I was offered a promotion in Jaipur

436
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,000
為了你的學業，我拒絕了升職
For the sake of your studies, I denied the promotion

437
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,650
我總是說，你想學多少就學多少
I have always said that study as much as you want

438
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,730
我來還貸款，我不會讓你有任何的負擔
I'll pay the loans but I won't let all the burden fall on you

439
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,400
為了你好，我不允許你這麼做
I'm disallowing this for your own good

440
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,380
但是爸爸，你還要操多少心？
But Dad, for how long are you gonna be concerned?

441
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,500
作為父母，你所能做的就是讓他做好準備
As a parent all you can do is prepare him

442
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,730
這樣他才能為自己著想
So that he can think about his own good himself

443
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,170
你已經做到了
And you've done that

444
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,620
你可以傳授學生知識，但學生必須自己參加考試
You can teach a student but he has to take the exam himself

445
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,420
好吧，看來我的話在這裏冇有任何意義
Alright then, it seems like my words have no meaning here

446
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,130
爸爸，你曾經還為了他的未來放棄了升職
Dad, even you took a risk of your promotion for his future

447
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,730
現在他為了自己的未來而辭職，至少要對他有信心
Now that he's leaving his job for his own future, atleast have faith in him

448
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,430
我對一家有25年曆史的公司有信心
I have faith in a company which is 25 years old

449
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,000
但是你要我我怎麼能相信一個由4個業餘愛好者創建的創業公司
How can I trust a new company created by 4 amateurs

450
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,830
但是這個有25年曆史的公司也是由3到4個業餘愛好者創建的
But that 25 years old company was also created by some 3,4 amateurs

451
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:01,950
這家公司成立的那天，就有99家公司倒閉
And the day that company was created, another 99 companies were shut down

452
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,500
想想這概率，兒子
Probability Jeetu..

453
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,230
1%
1/100

454
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,730
如果你學過概率，那你應該能做出更明智的決定
If you had studied that chapter, your rank and decision both would've been better

455
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,570
爸爸，給他個機會

456
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,020
爸爸，別走

457
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,600
對不起

458
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
我冇能說服他

459
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,150
嘿，你為什麼哭？
Hey! why are you crying?

460
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,120
反正他也不會留下來
He wouldn't have stayed anyway

461
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,730
我不該說的
I shouldn't have said anything

462
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,120
好了，別哭了
Alright now please don't cry

463
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,100
對不起

464
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,600
你知道嗎? 從來冇有人像你一樣為我挺身而出
You know what? No one has ever stood up for me like you did

465
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,730
你已經盡力了，親愛的
You tried your best dear

466
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,530
你為什麼說對不起？
Why are you saying sorry?

467
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,330
我應該謝謝你才對
Infact I should say thanks to you

468
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:04,150
我們的婚姻是包辦的，所以我從來冇有對你說過句話
We had an arranged marriage so I've never said this to you

469
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,730
我愛你
I love you

470
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,700
我也愛你
i love you too

471
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
抱歉我插一句
sorry for interrupting but...

472
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,060
我不能在你們app上買任何東西？
i can't not order xxx and xxx and anything else in the app?

473
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
不能
no, not even xxx

474
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
而且我為之驕傲
and i am proud of it

475
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,670
我們"枕頭柳"隻關註一樣商品，那就是……
we here at pillow willow, are focusing only on one thing

476
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,400
枕頭
pillows

477
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
至少接下來的三個季度是這樣的
at least for next 3 Quarters

478
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
我們想要像flip cart一樣
we want to be like flip card

479
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
但是隻做枕頭
but only for pillows

480
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,870
但是……
but uh...

481
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,570
flip cart 早就有枕頭了，對吧？
flip card already has pillows right?

482
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,350
我想你的時間到了，謝謝
i guess that's all you can xxx thank you

483
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,020
謝謝大家
thank you xxx and team everyone

484
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,060
下麵有請22號團隊
next one we have team no.2

485
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,250
讓我們歡迎
please welcome xxx and xxx

486
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,550
納文團隊
from i am in door

487
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,180
接下來的五分鍾舞臺歸你們
guys the stage is yours for next 5 mins

488
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,300
大家好

489
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,350
我是納文

490
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,770
你一小時前肯定見過我和我的團隊成員
I'm sure you must have met me and my team members an hour ago

491
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,730
我們就是剛才到處乞求的人
We're the same guys who were like pleading, begging..

492
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,730
甚至可能還威脅了你
And in some cases even threatning you

493
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,730
隻為在這張紙上簽個名
To get one lousy signature on this page

494
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,380
可以讓我們可以在舞臺上講述産品的說明
Which says it's okay for us to present our product on the stage

495
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,730
但是，如你所見，一個簽名的都冇有
But, as you can see, we didn't even come close

496
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,520
很抱歉
well I'm really sorry, but

497
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,120
恐怕我不能讓你繼續
i'm afraid i can't allow you to xxx

498
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,500
如果我允許你講述你的産品，可能對其他團隊就不公平了
it would't be fair to other team if i allow you to talk about your product

499
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
我們可以讓下一組繼續嗎
so could we have the next team on stage please

500
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,820
你剛才說我不能談論産品
but you said you're not allow us to talk product on stage

501
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,980
但是我還是能講5分鍾的吧
but i still have the 5 mins right？

502
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,720
行，那你還有四分三十秒
ok you have 4：30

503
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,600
我在美國有一些朋友
I have some friends in The United states

504
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,820
他們在矽穀工作
They work in the silicon valley

505
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,530
他們告訴我，每當一個企業家在那裏創業... ..。
They told me that whenever an entrepreneur starts a startup there...

506
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,250
他們被問到的第一個問題是“什麼? ”
The very first question they are being asked is "What?"

507
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,100
産品是什麼？
What is the product?

508
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,730
而在印度，被問“什麼”的可能性要小得多
And here in India "what" is far less likely, everyone asks "why?"

509
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,050
為什麼要創業？
Why entrepreneurship?

510
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,730
今天我們麵臨著同樣的挑戰。
Today we are facing a similar challenge..

511
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,020
就好像冇人願意聽我們的”什麼? ”
Like nobody is willing to listen to our "what?"

512
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,730
那麼讓我來談談“為什麼? ”
So let me talk about The "why?"

513
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,250
為什麼要創業？
Why entrepreneurship?

514
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,330
我不知道
I don't know

515
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,100
也許是因為在公司工作的時候，老闆的"祝福"讓我感到沮喪
Maybe I was frustrated at my well wisher boss in a corporate job

516
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,130
或許我是受到了《華爾街之狼》和《社交網絡》的啓發
Or maybe I was inspired by "The Wolf Of wall street" and "The social network"

517
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,200
又或者也許我喜歡解決現實生活中的問題
Or maybe I enjoyed solving the real life problems

518
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:48,230
你們還記得嗎，在90年代，我們常常在薯片包裝袋裏得到免費的tazos（類似小浣熊卡）？
Do you guys remember, in 90s when we used to get those free tazos inside a chips packet?

519
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,730
tazos是由塑料製成的，就像閃閃發光的圓盤，上麵印著卡通圖案
Circular tazos made up of plastic, like shining discs which had cartoons imprinted on them

520
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,430
我曾經喜歡的要命
I used to be like crazy about them

521
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,730
我想要無窮無盡的tazos
You know all I wanted was 100s and 100s of tazos

522
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,530
這樣我就可以把它們儲存在一個空的果醬瓶子裏
So that I could store them in an empty bottle of fruit jam

523
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,730
但是我的零用錢每周隻能買得起一包
But I could only afford 1 packet of chips a week from my pocket money

524
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,120
當我的朋友們已經有二三十個的時候，我隻有5個
While my friends were piling on to 25-30 tazos, I could manage only 5

525
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,600
你們現在一定在想，這又有什麼難的
You guys must be thinking right now that how trivial this problem is

526
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,730
但在那個時候，對於一個10歲的孩子來說，這真的很難很難
But at that time for a 10 years old kid, it was a huge life problem

527
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,730
而且這個問題亟待解決
And it needed to be solved

528
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,830
然後我有了個主意
and then I got an idea

529
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,370
有一天，我用一枚硬幣把我所有的tazos都刮花了，直到它們變得完全是白色的
One day I scratched all of my tazos with a coin until they became completely white

530
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:31,320
第二天當我去上學的時候
The next day when I went to school

531
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,730
就有人說納文有一些獨特的空白tazos
A news had been spread that Naveen has some unique tazos, blank tazos

532
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,950
你可以在上麵畫任何你喜歡的卡通人物
On which you can draw any of your favourite cartoon character

533
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,650
突然間所有人都想要我的空白tazos
and suddenly everybody wanted it

534
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:53,020
同學們準備用他們的10個、15個甚至20個tazos去換一個我的空白tazos
People were ready to trade their 10,15 and even 20 tazos just to get that one special tazo

535
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,820
一個月後，我又去了那家商店
One month after that, I went to the shop again

536
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,930
但不是去買薯片
But not to buy a packet of chips

537
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,730
相反，我買了一瓶新的果醬
Instead I bought a new bottle of fruit jam

538
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,230
這是我人生中第一個商業模式
That was my life's first business model

539
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,830
在那之後，我進行了很多商業冒險
I executed a lot of business ventures after that

540
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,130
我曾經用電腦寫CD，然後在學校裏賣
I used to write CDs from my computer and sold them in school

541
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,730
在當地贊助商的幫助下，我在大學裏設法出版了我的雜誌
With the help of local sponsors I managed to print my magazine in college

542
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,370
但是現在和過去有很大的不同
But there's a huge difference between then and now

543
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,320
今天我很害怕
Today I'm scared

544
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,250
因為競爭非常殘酷
Because the competition is very ruthless

545
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,930
你知道今天站在這裏，我不覺得自己是一個企業家
You know standing here today, I don't feel like an entrepreneur

546
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,230
我覺得自己好像是一個真人秀的參賽者
I feel as if I'm a contestant in a reality show

547
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,780
我甚至在錶演前就被淘汰了
and I'm being eliminated even before performing

548
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:55,530
實際上今天的評委,我曾經的老闆拉傑先生用一句話
Actually today's judge my ex boss Mr Rajat khanna had summed up the competition..

549
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,730
總結了什麼是競爭
in a very simple sentence

550
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,150
他說現在每個辦公室的小隔間裏都坐著一位創業者
He says that there's a startup founder sitting in every office cubicle these days

551
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,230
那麼，在成仟上萬的企業家中，我的位置哪裏呢？
Then where am I standing among those thousands of entrepreneurs?

552
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,730
現在我很懷疑我自己的能力
Now I'm dubious about my own capabilities you see

553
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,630
然後我想，我和這些成功的企業家有什麼不同？
Then I thought that how am I different with all these successful entrepreneurs?

554
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,370
是什麼特質讓他們如此特別，而我卻冇有呢？
What makes them special that I don't have yet?

555
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,330
我有我的學曆，我的智慧
I have my education, my wits

556
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,730
我有一支堅定支持我的團隊
I have a team that stands resolutely behind me

557
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,730
所以，從技術上講，我也應該是成功的，對嗎？
So, technically I should be successful as well, right?

558
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,030
但也不一定
Well not necessarily

559
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,730
這些成功人士還有一個共同點
You know those guys had one more extra thing in common

560
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,230
這也許是最重要的一點
Which was perhaps the most crucial thing

561
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:40,730
他們拒絕放棄
They refused to give up

562
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,430
閱讀任何企業家的自傳
Read any entrepreneur's biography

563
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,130
裏麵充滿了雞湯
Its filled with phrases

564
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,300
就像在黑暗中與睏難作鬥爭，探索未知領域
Like a shot in the dark fighting against the odds exploring uncharted territories

565
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,730
那麼為什麼在這麼早的階段就害怕失敗呢？
Then why am I scared to fail at such an early stage?

566
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,430
冇有人第一次就成功發明發動機
Nobody invented an engine their first time

567
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,430
冇有人第一次就成功發現新大陸
Nobody discovered an Island their first time

568
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,730
但是他們不斷嘗試，不斷去做
But they kept on trying, they kept on working

569
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,230
如果房間是黑暗的，你必須要開燈
If the room is dark and you have to light a bulb

570
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,930
如果你不斷摸索總機上的開關
and if you kept fumbling the switches on the switchboard

571
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,730
總會有一個開關能點亮該死的燈泡
Then one of the switch will light the fucking bulb

572
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,730
甘地曾說過。
Gandhiji has said..

573
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,530
不管生活中出現什麼問題，隻有一個解決辦法。
that whatever problem may come in life, there's only one solution..

574
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,530
幹就完事了
Bow down and get to work

575
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,730
所有這些導師，天使投資人和活動
all these mentors, angel investors and events

576
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,730
我冇有所有這些外部因素
I don't have all these external factors in my hands

577
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,530
我的手中就隻有我的工作
All I have in my hands is my work

578
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,030
無論何時，隻要有機會。
And whenever I'll get an opportunity..

579
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,730
我他媽的一定會成功的
I'll fucking ace it with my work

580
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,730
今天一個這樣的機會就從我這裏被奪走了
One such opportunity was being snatched from me today

581
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,870
我冇有放棄
i didn't give up and run back

582
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,870
而是選擇站在這裏
but i choose to stand here to face you guys

583
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,400
因為我要抓住每一個機會
because ultra do not loose opportunities

584
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,930
拉傑，你告訴我，我不能在臺上賣我的産品
Rajat you told me that I cannot sell my product here on stage

585
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,730
所以我賣自己
Therefore I sold myself

586
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,800
謝謝大家
thanks guys

587
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,420
thanks guys

588
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,030
你剛才真的冇有必要裝英雄
There was no need to become a hero there

589
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,230
每個人都喜歡拉傑
Everyone likes Rajat

590
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,130
你在舞臺上狠狠地打他臉
And you bashed him on the stage

591
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,330
你知道你帶來了多少負麵宣傳嗎？
Do you know how much negative publicity you have generated?

592
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,330
至少是個宣傳，反正也冇人在乎我們
Atleast its a publicity No one was giving a shit about us anyway

593
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,730
事實上，宣傳給我們帶來了4張名片
Infact that publicity got us 4 visiting cards

594
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,730
所有的名片上都寫著“打電話給我的秘書”
All the cards are the ones with "call my secretary" written on them

595
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,930
至少一個月之內我們都不會見麵
We're not gonna get a meeting atleast before a month

596
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,400
至少比冇有名片要好
Atleast its better than zero visiting cards

597
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,270
我穀歌了一下。
and I googled it..

598
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,730
甘地從來冇說過“幹就完事了”
Gandhiji never said "Bow down and get to work"

599
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,730
是啊，我不小心說錯了
Yeah I mistakenly uttered that in a flow

600
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,030
真的嗎，納文? ，順其自然？
Really Naveen? in a flow?

601
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,730
混蛋，這是你讓別人給你口的時候才說的話吧
Fucker this is what you say when you're asking for a blowjob

602
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:56,730
不是的，如果你在一句引語前加上一個著名的人物，會産生雙重影響
No man, It creates a double impact if you add a famous personality in front of a quote

603
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,730
你為什麼笑得這麼開心？
Why are you smiling so much?

604
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,230
你爸爸離開你家的時候很憤怒，你不擔心嗎？
Your Dad left your home outraged, Aren't you worried about it?

605
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,230
一點也不擔心，我會去看他的
Not a tad worried, I'll see about that

606
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,730
你剛剛做愛了，對吧？
You just got laid, right?

607
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,050
想什麼呢？尤吉，現在才晚上8點
What are you looking at Yogi? Its just 8 in the evening

608
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
納文·巴薩爾

609
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,970
是我

610
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,970
你的演講太棒了

611
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,970
你都上微博熱搜了
social media is crazy about your video

612
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:39,330
每個創始人和風險投資家都在談論你
Every founder and VC is talking about you

613
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,730
事實上，財政部長剛剛發了一條關於你的推特
Infact the finance minister just wrote a tweet about you

614
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,350
真的嗎？
what？ really？

615
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,730
開個玩笑，冇那麼誇張
Just kidding, It wasn't that big a deal

616
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,730
但是，是的，有一篇文章專門報到你的故事
But yeah YourStory wrote an article about you a while ago

617
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,150
順便說一嘴，我是普尼特，這是我的名片
by the way i'm Puneet i work for a vc firm, and this is my card

618
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,730
我在NASCOM上看到了你的想法
I saw your idea at NASCOM conclave

619
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,820
非常有趣
quiet interesting

620
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:07,600
你們有空來我辦公室聊一聊嗎
why don't you guys drop by my office sometimes

621
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,870
當然，求之不得
sure we love to

622
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,780
那你們給我秘書打電話吧
so call my secretary

623
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,450
我剛想起來
infact you know what, i

624
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:26,850
我星期四下午有空，你們星期四有時間嗎？
I'm free on thursday afternoon, what are you guys doing on thursday?
