1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,410
你已經把你的創業想法跟我說過無數次了
You've told me about your start-up idea over a 100 times now.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,310
你著手去做了嗎？
Why don't you do something about it?

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,580
我怎樣才能融到錢，巴蒂？
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,580
不是每個人的運氣都像你那麼好
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,910
你是什麼？
What are you?

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,030
什麼意思？
What do you mean

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,980
你是啤酒
You are a beer.

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,930
我現在就辭職
I will resign right now.

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,780
我的B計畫會被選中嗎？
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,030
你應該...-永不放棄
You should... -never quit

11
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,960
你應該...-永不放棄
You should... -never quit

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,880
夥計們
Guys!!!

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,510
我放棄了
I quit!!!

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,130
開始創業吧
Now let's just begin with the start-up

15
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,680
我們三年前就開始討論這個問題了-納文，我們已經討論過這個問題了
We've only been talking about it since 3rd year. -Naveen we've already discussed this.

16
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,110
一年半之後，等你從巴西回來的時候
That by the time you come back from Brazil, after a

17
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,130
一年半之後，等你從巴西回來的時候
year and a half, Yogi will make some contacts here.

18
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,530
尤吉將在這裏建立一些關係
year and a half, Yogi will make some contacts here.

19
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,980
理解我一下，我現在不能辭職
Guys try to understand, I can't leave my job right now.

20
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,300
大家開始意識到我的潛力
People are realizing my potential.

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,560
我是公司的重要員工
I’m a valuable employee to the company.

22
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,300
聽我說
Listen to me.

23
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,010
一個新的矽穀正在這裏崛起
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here!

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,060
而你卻還在用 Python 寫代碼
And you're still writing codes on Python.

25
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,510
每當這個國家的畢業生厭倦了朝九晚五的工作..
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

26
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,080
為了擺脫睏境，他們隻有三個選擇
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

27
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,680
讀MBA
MBA

28
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,110
讀IAS
IAS

29
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,130
或者去創業
or Start-Up.

30
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,910
北京
Beijing.

31
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,380
我們準備開始在那裏擴張，比原計劃提前了6個月
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,910
一周內有個會議
Apointment within a week.

33
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,930
我們需要一個聰明人
We need someone smart over there...

34
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,760
像你一樣
Like you.

35
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,160
現在才是真正的選擇
Now is the real choice.

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,780
已經得到的一定比不確定的更好
One in hand is obviously better than one not-so-sure in the bush.

37
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,360
是納文讓我來這兒的
He's the one who requested me to come here.

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,160
他..
He...

39
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,750
不得不馬上離開
... had to leave urgently.

40
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,280
讓我用啤酒再給你們講一遍
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

41
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,680
它不會燙傷你，隻會灑出來
It won't burn, even if it spills.

42
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,610
你回來了
You're back!!!

43
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,610
我就知道你會來的
I knew it, you'd come!

44
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,110
阿克希爾給我們坑了
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

45
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,610
我們的名字不在獲勝者名單上
Our name's not on the winner's list!

46
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,860
但是等等..
But wait...

47
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,960
現在我的薪水怎麼辦？
What about my salary now?

48
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,180
如果你不能用兩塊披薩餵飽你的團隊，說明團隊人太多了

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,390
媽媽! 我不想結婚
MOM! I don't want to get married!!!

50
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,640
我才27歲，還冇到結婚的年齡
I'm only 27. Not even old enough to get married!

51
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,870
不要叫我尚娜·貝塔
Don't "Shona beta" me!

52
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,590
媽媽... 媽媽，別對我撒謊，好嗎？
Mummy... Mummy, don't lie to me, OK?

53
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,210
你冇有得甲狀腺癌
You don't have any Thyroid cancer!

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
好的，等等... 我接到另一個電話
OK wait... I'm getting another call.

55
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,720
是的... 等等! 等等
Yeah... Wait! Wait!

56
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,680
餵？是阿爾蒂嗎？
Yeah Aarti?

57
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,430
實際上還冇有，我還在開會
Actually no. I'm still in a client meeting.

58
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,270
你在哪兒？
Where are you?

59
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,310
哦，你已經到了？
Oh, you've already reached?

60
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,120
在哪裏？
Where?

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,020
好的好的
OK. OK.

62
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,180
這麼說你已經到了？
You've just reached, then?

63
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,460
不不不..
No, no, no...

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,170
我的會議... 可以取消
My client meeting... can be cancelled!

65
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,530
是的，我在路上了
Yeah, I'm on my way!

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,440
我們走
Let's go.

67
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
我們隨便繞一圈再回來
We've to go around and then come back here!

68
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,700
快點
Come on!

69
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,280
開車啊
Come on already!

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,360
嗨
Hi!

71
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,880
對不起，我來晚了
Sorry, I got a little late.

72
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,910
希望我冇有讓你等太久
Hope I didn't keep you waiting for long!

73
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,280
不
No!

74
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
氣氛不錯
Nice ambience!

75
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,970
你點了什麼嗎？
Did you order anything?

76
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,240
兩杯卡佈奇諾
Akhilesh, 2 cappuccinos!

77
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,020
不... 我什麼都不想要
No... I don't want to have anything!

78
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,430
不不……我自己喝兩杯
No, no. Both are for me.

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,130
我現在喝一杯，另一杯等涼了再喝
I'll drink one now, and the other one later, once it gets cold.

80
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,580
在這點冰咖啡要額外收一百塊
These guys charge 100 bucks extra for cold coffee!

81
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,170
順便說一句
By the way...

82
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,140
你看起來..
You look...

83
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,030
和你的照片完全不同
Quite different from your pictures!

84
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,980
我知道
I know!

85
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,890
我不上相
I'm not photogenic!

86
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,740
我是說..
I mean...

87
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,400
我在現實生活中看起來還不錯
I look good in real life!

88
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,270
但是我的照片，照出來效果不是很好
But my pictures, don't come out that great!

89
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
你以前約過嗎？
You've met guys before... like this?

90
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,100
嗯
Yes!

91
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,720
兩三次吧
2-3 times

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
我也約過
Me too!

93
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,570
六次
6 times!!!

94
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,960
你知道..
You know...

95
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,940
自從我從印度管理學院畢業之後
Since I've completed my P.G. from IIM Indore?

96
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,360
我媽讓姑娘們排隊等著我去見她們
Mom's had girls lined up for me to meet!

97
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,270
我告訴她”媽媽..
I told her, "Mom...

98
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,040
我現在不能結婚
...I can't marry right now!...

99
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,330
我想探索這個世界……
...I want to explore the world...

100
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,510
和朋友一起旅行……
...Travel with friends...

101
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,400
... 潛水..
...Scuba dive...

102
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,180
滑翔"
...Sky dive"

103
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,820
我告訴你... 你也應該停止這種行為
I'm telling you... You too should stop with this marraige shabang!

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,270
婚姻根本毫無意義
Marriage doesn't even make sense

105
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,860
像我們這樣的年輕人應該玩得開心
Youngsters like us should have fun!

106
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,770
但我覺得我媽強迫我註冊賬號是好事
It's a good thing actually, that my mom forcefully made me a profie.

107
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,230
否則，我們就不會有今天的約會了
Or else, we wouldn't have been on this date!

108
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,760
等一下
Wait a minute!

109
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,640
你媽媽... 讓你..
Your mom... made your...

110
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,040
註冊約炮軟件？
Tinder profile?

111
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,110
約炮？
Tinder?

112
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,350
不，不，是 shaadi. com
No, no. Shaadi.com

113
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,890
你是..
You're..

114
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,220
嗨
Hi.

115
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,450
尼基塔？
Nikita?

116
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,040
尼基塔
Nikita.

117
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,910
尼基塔？
Nikita?

118
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,590
尼基塔
Nikita.

119
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,290
哦..
Oh...

120
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,650
哦，糟了……
Oh shit... shit!

121
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,590
抱歉抱歉
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

122
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,710
我有點懵逼
I got confused!

123
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,900
幸好他提前來了
It's a good thing he showed up early!

124
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,780
我們就要……
We were about to get...

125
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,850
我們就要結婚了
WE were about to get married!

126
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,340
索拉佈 · 曼達爾
Saurabh Mandal!

127
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,270
我是科技公司的市場主管
I'm a marketing head in Technity.

128
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,930
你是做什麼的？
And what do you do?

129
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,300
今天是星期四？
Today's Thursday?

130
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,730
是的
Yes.

131
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,110
星期四我..

玩得開心
And have fun also.

138
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,160
索拉佈先生？
Mr. Saurabh?

139
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,790
阿蒂？
Aarti?

140
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,420
是這樣，阿蒂，我想在開始之前先澄清一些事情
Actually, Aarti. I wanted to clear something first, before we start.

141
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,740
索拉佈先生，我知道你想說什麼
Mr. Saurabh, I know what you want to say.

142
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,820

144
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,130
不是，不是這樣的
No, not really. That's not it.

145
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,480
不是，不是這樣的
No, not really. That's not it.

146
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,890
你怎麼知道我喜歡卡佈奇諾？
How did you know that I like cappuccino?

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,180
阿蒂，聽著..
Aarti, look...

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
我一開始就不想來這裏
I didn't want to come here in the first place

149
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,800
我媽逼我來的
It's just that my mom wanted me to be here.

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,870
父母逼婚，你懂的
You know how parents pressurize you

151
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,370
你的..
Your...

152
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,780
你的小胡子和阿尼爾·卡普爾的一模一樣
Your moustache is just like Anil Kapoor's!

153
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,700
不，阿蒂..
No look, Aarti...

154
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,540
事實上，我不能跟你結婚
Actually, I can't go ahead with this marriage!

155
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,940
索拉佈先生，我理解你的不情願
Mr. Saurabh, I understand your reluctance!

156
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,190
你要多少糖
How much sugar?

157
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,570
一包
One.

158
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,690
跟我一樣
Just like me!

159
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,750
跟你說實話吧
Look, if I were to tell you the truth...

160
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,540
在這之前我也有過兩個男朋友
I too, had two boyfriends before this

161
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,830
而且我和他們也很親密
And I got intimate with them, as well!

162
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,300
但我們冇有做任何“骯髒”的事情
But we didn't do anything "dirty".

163
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,080
我隻會……
That I will do...

164
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,450
和我的丈夫做
...only with my husband.

165
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,490
畢竟，我是一個印度人
After all, I'm an Indian!

166
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,950
我怎麼能忘本呢
How can I forget my roots and culture

167
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,840
阿蒂，毫無疑問，你是個很好的女孩..
Aarti. No doubt, you're a very nice girl...

168
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,860
潘迪先生也是這麼說的
Panditji too, says the same

169
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,410
不，不，現在..
No, no. Now...

170
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,550
我..
Now, I...

171
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,120
我..
Now, I...

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,820
索拉佈先生，我同意了
Mr. Saurabh, it's a yes for me.

173
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,620
隻是..
Just...

174
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,090
別像上一個家夥..
Like the last guy...

175
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,840
不要對我隱瞞任何事
Don't hide anything from me!

176
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,630
為什麼... 他隱瞞了什麼？
Why... What did the last one hide?

177
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,930
我和他的婚事已經確定了……
My marriage with him had been confirmed.

178
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,010
但就在訂婚前幾天..
But just a few days before the engagement...

179
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,010
我爸爸知道了
...dad got to know that...

180
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,490
他辭掉了一份穩定的工作，準備開始創業
...he was quitting a stable job to begin a start-up!

181
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,510
然後我們的婚事就此結束了
And the marriage got canned, then and there.

182
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,100
後來我就看到了你的資料
That's when I saw your profile and...

183
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,880
就算他要創業又怎樣
So what, if he was going to begin a start-up?

184
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,750
為什麼女孩要嫁給創業者？
Why would any girl marry a "start-up guy"?

185
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,410
現在這個時代... 如果公司做得不好..
Now... If the company doesn't do well...

186
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,530
我難道要放下家務出門工作嗎？
Will I have to leave my household chores and go do a job?

187
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,730
我難道要放下家務出門工作嗎？
Will I have to leave my household chores and go do a job?

188
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,270
你說呢，索拉佈先生？
Tell me Mr. Saurabh?

189
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,740
實際上，阿蒂
Actually, Aarti...

190
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,500
這正是我想告訴你的..
This is exactly, what I wanted to tell you about...

191
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,630
從明天開始自己洗衣服
No laundry from tomorrow!

192
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,600
告別保潔阿姨
No maid from tomorrow!

193
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,730
告別牛奶
No milk from tomorrow!

194
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,860
連報紙都要告別

195
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,220
告別健身房會員

196
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,270
出門坐地鐵
Metros will be used instead of the car!

197
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,630
節約用電
Electricity will be saved!

198
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,960
寬帶從8mbps 降低到1mbps
Internet speed will be reduced from 8mbps to 1mbps!

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,450
別啊，兄弟
No. No. No. No dude.

200
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,490
寬帶就別降了
Atleast let the net speed stay!

201
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,070
難道你不想要傑圖了嗎？
Do you not want Jeetu, then?

202
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,880
如果我們存的錢不夠，怎麼保證他的工資呢？
If we don't save enough, how will we ensure his salary?

203
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,430
好吧，讓我們把速度從8mbps 降低到4mbps
Alright then. Let's reduce the speed from 8mbps to 4mbps.

204
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
付費電視停掉
Table top-ups will be stopped!

205
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,320
外賣停掉
Ordering food from restaurants will be stopped!

206
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,010
絕對要停
Will be absolutely stopped!

207
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,140
實際上，任何奢侈消費都要停
Infact, all kinds of luxury expenditures will be absolutely stopped!

208
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,160
現在有多少了
What's the total?

209
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
現在有多少了
What's the total?

210
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,540

218
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,970

我們可以存一年半的錢

224
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,590
支付一個月的薪水
...and shell out one month's salary!

225
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,270
“歐耶! ”
"Alright!"

226
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
“歐耶! ”
"Alright!"

227
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,820
曼達爾，你在幹什麼
Madal, what are you doing dude?

228
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,360
什麼？
What?

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,420
你在幹什麼？

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,320

什麼都聽不見

00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,120
你繼續幹吧
You carrry on!

234
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
“歐耶! ”
"Alright!"

235
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,290
我想說的是..
What I'm saying is...

236
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
我們再加50塊..
Let's add another 50 bucks to this...

237
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,980
找幾個實習生來寫代碼
And hire some intern to do the coding.

238
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,580
尤吉，實習生能替代傑圖嗎？
Yogi, an intern will replace Jeetu, now?

239
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,180
我們公司需要有工作經驗的人
We need people with some work experience in our compnay!

在高層工作過的人

能夠製定戰略的人

243
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,890
納文..
Naveen...

244
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,660
你找到我的那件 t 恤了嗎？
Did you find that t-shirt of mine?

245
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,390
什麼 t 恤？
What t-shirt?

246
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,990
‘ InfoCom’那個
The 'InfoCom' one.

247
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,150
我在那裏工作了四年
Where I'd an experience of 4 years?

248
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,630
作為高級顧問
As a Senior Consultant!

249
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,840
因為我組建了一個團隊..
Since I'd BUILT a team there...

250
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
他們把那件 t 恤送給了我
They'd gifted that t-shirt to me.

251
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,140
我不知道，我們現在很忙
I don't know dude. We're busy right now!

252
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
媽的
Shit!

253
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,950
現在我得想想該穿什麼了
Now, I'll have to strategize what to wear!

254
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,590
那我們該怎麼辦？
What do we do then?

255
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,790
夥計，我覺得我們卡在這了
Dude, I think we're getting a little impatient here!

256
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,330
我在想如果..
I was thinking, what if...

257
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,880
傑圖設法說服了桑亞
Jeetu manages to convince Soumya!

258
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,790
納文..
Naveen...

259
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,260
那是他的妻子
She's his wife!

260
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
她能跟他上床
She gives him sex!

261
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,950
你永遠不能說服一個能跟你上床的女人
You can never convince a woman who gives you sex!

262
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,040
相信我
Trust me.

263
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,460
這都是經驗之談
This is all coming from experience!

264
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
聽著，尤吉……
Look Yogi...

265
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
冇有傑圖，就冇有公司
Without Jeetu, we have no company.

266
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,500
納文..
Naveen...

267
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,700
我們現在冇有工作
We've no jobs.

268
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,060
不管有冇有傑圖，我們都得開一家公司
We have to start a company, with or without Jeetu.

269
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,050
尤吉……
Yogi...

270
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,070
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

271
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,440
你有冇有考慮好？
Did you think about it?

272
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,660
我昨天問了你什麼？
I'd asked you something, yesterday?

273
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,820
你問了什麼？
What'd you asked?

274
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,890
那個事……
That thing...

275
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,550
我能加入你們的創業嗎？
Can I be part of your start-up?

276
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,830
什麼？
WHAT?

277
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
為什麼？
WHY?

278
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,210
你說“為什麼”是什麼意思？
What do you mean by "Why?"?

279
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,450
你們都是工程師
You all are engineers!

280
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,490
你需要一個有MBA的人
You need an MBA!

281
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,490
如果冇有商業專長，你們如何經營一家公司？
How will you'll run a company without business expertise?

282
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,640
曼達爾，我還冇考慮好
Mandal, I'll let you know!

283
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,650
給我點時間
Give me some time.

284
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,660
這是一個非常重要的職業決定
It's a very important professional decision!

285
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,490
我會告訴你的，好嗎?-好的
I'll let you know, alright? -OK

286
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,900
那麼你會給我發郵件，還是口頭交流？
So will you send me a mail, or you'll communicate verbally?

287
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,110
我能在星期五之前接到電話嗎？
Should I expect a call by Friday?

288
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,740
我會..
I'll...

289
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,950
等星期五幹什麼? 真是個可愛的孩子
Why Friday? He's a sweet kid!

290
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,450
今天就讓我們來給你麵試吧
Let's do your G.D. and P.I. today itself!

291
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,120
明天揭曉結果
And the results tomorrow.

292
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,700
今天麵試？
Personal interview, today?

293
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,680
已經10點了，我什麼時候準備... ..
Iit's already 10. When will I prepare...

294
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,910
媽的，已經10點了？
Fuck, it's 10 already?

295
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,410
要死要死要死
I'm going to get killed!

296
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,890
10點怎麼了？
What if it's 10?

297
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,100
‘ Jhalak’隻在晚上10點出現
'Jhalak' comes up only at 10 in the night!

298
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,370
不行，尤吉! 我得去見史瑞雅，如果我遲到了，她會整死我的
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If I get late, she'll screw me!

299
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,680
不行，尤吉! 我得去見史瑞雅，如果我遲到了，她會整死我的
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If I get late, she'll screw me!

300
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,460
你不是已經告訴她我們的創業的事了嗎？
Haven't you told her already, about our start-up?

301
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,810
我都好幾天冇見她了
Where have I met her, since so many days?

302
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,110
曼達爾
MANDAL!

303
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,400
我的洗麵奶呢？
Where's my face-wash dude?

304
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,490
那個庫魯勒本草洗麵奶？
The 'Kurule' medical therapy one?

305
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,940
別用那個
Don't use that!

306
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,960
我用了之後它和我的四個粉刺結合成一個癤子
I used it and 4 of my pimples combined into a boil!

307
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,340
不是，我的洗麵奶
No dude. My face-wash!

308
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,120
你要去找洗麵奶嗎？還是我們應該在麵試前取消你的資格？
Will you get it, or should we disqualify you before the interview round, itself?

309
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,930
我正要去呢
I was just about to go!

310
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
聽著..
Dude, look...

311
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,520
有個程序員..
There's this coder...

312
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,490
他才大三
He's in the third year.

313
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,520
他是我一個朋友的叔叔的兒子
He's the son of the paternal uncle of a mutual friend!

314
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,850
他就像是我的家人
He's almost family!

315
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,460
我們帶上他吧，我嚮你保證，他會很棒的
Let's get him onboard. I assure you, he'll rock!

316
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
聽著，尤吉
Look, Yogi!

317
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,290
公司的一切都在於人
A comapny's all about the people in it.

318
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,240
你認為，任何一個大學生都可以取代傑圖
You think, any college guy can replace Jeetu...

319
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,900
如果我們這樣隨機招人，那為什麼我們不雇傭曼達爾呢？
If that's how randomly we want to hire people, why don't we hire Mandal as well?

320
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,440
對不起，打擾了你的重要會議
Sorry to disturb your important meeting!

321
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,040
但是我希望你能做出正確的決定
But I hope you take the right decision!

322
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,890
我也很看好傑圖
I also love Jeetu!

323
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,730
雖然已經過去三年了，我當年還是抄他的答題卡畢業的
Though 3 years late, I've passed by cheating from his answer sheet.

324
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,460
我當然希望他能加入
We definitely want him onboard.

325
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,790
但目前我們不能滿足他的工資，而且急需一個程序員
But till the time we do not ensure his salary, we need a coder.

326
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,720
我告訴你..
I'm telling you...

327
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,460
我們去見見這個家夥..
Let's go meet this guy...

328
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,500
然後就開始幹吧
And let's get the fucking thing started!

329
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,370
好吧
OK, alright.

330
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,650
現在我先去見史瑞雅
Let me meet Shreya for now.

331
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,710
然後，我們下午去見那個家夥，好嗎？
After that, let's go meet this guy, in the afternoon. OK?

332
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,370
我看起來怎麼樣？
How do I look?

333
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,210
還行
Fair!

334
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,480
好吧，借過，我去找史瑞雅，然後再聯係你
OK. You make a move, I'll go meet Shreya and then catch you!

335
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,510
走走走走
Go. Go. Go. Go.

336
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,010
餵？
Hello?

337
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,030
納文-嗨，史瑞雅
Naveen!!! - Hey Shreya!

338
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,170
你還冇有升級你的寬帶，對不對
You still haven't upgraded your internet, have you?

339
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,430
近來可好？
How are you?

340
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,410
你真是個守財奴，一輩子守財奴
You've always been and always will be a miser!

341
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,410
你能看見我嗎？
Can you see me?

342
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,370
等一下
Wait a second.

343
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,840
你能看見我？
You can see me?

344
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
我現在能看見你了
I can see you now.

345
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,400
天啊，你穿的那是件什麼襯衫？
Oh God, what is that shirt you're wearing?

346
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,150
你是從園丁那裏借的嗎？
Have you borrowed it from the gardenkeeper?

347
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,280
事實上，他的和我的襯衫尺寸是一樣的，所以很適合我
Actually, his and mine shirt size is the same. So it fit me!

348
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,170
順便說一下，他的妻子穿XL看起來也是這樣，會適合你
By the way, his wife wears XL. Looks like that too, will fit you!

349
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,630
要是你有什麼是XL號的就好了，不是嗎？
If only you had something XL, no?

350
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,760
寶貝，我有我的心
Baby, I have my heart.

351
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,740
我的心是如此的寬廣
My heart is so big.

352
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,750
好吧，你應該知道，我一直在不丹尋找WiFi信號
OK, you should know, that I haven't been looking for

353
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,890
來聽你這些廢話
wi-fi all over Bhutan, to listen to all these ridicules.

354
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,460
是啊，好像是我要你去不丹似的
Yeah, as if I asked to go to Bhutan!

355
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,490
學習冥想，谘詢項目隻是一個借口
Meditation is being learnt, with Consultancy Project only as an excuse.

356
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,800
如果你想學冥想，你完全可以……
If it's meditation that you wanted to learn, you could've done that

357
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,380
每天早上醒來看電視上的《拉姆德夫巴巴》
just by waking up in the mornings to watch 'Ramdev baba' on the T.V.

358
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,580
對，我就喜歡看那些毛茸茸的老男人在早上6點汗流浹背
Yeah, because I just love old, hairy men sweating at 6 in the morning!

359
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,620
你以為我為什麼要和你上床，寶貝？
Why do you think I sleep with you, baby?

360
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,170
寶貝，我認為你和我上床是因為
Baby, I thought you sleep with me, because not

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
你在做慈善，不是嗎？
a lot of men, believe in doing charity, no?

362
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,820
你想讓我開始數做慈善的數量嗎？
Oh, you want me to start counting down on the charity cases?

363
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,820
我們是不是應該數數你的約會史?-不不不不..
Should we start listing your dating history, now? -No, no, no, no...

364
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,250
什麼時候我的真愛，撕開雲彩..
When is my true love, by tearing through clouds...

365
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,340
降落在這個我們稱之為印度的土地上
Landing on the grounds of this country, we call India!

366
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,280
四點鍾
Four O'clock!

367
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,860
四點整
Sharp!

368
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,570
你會來接我的，對吧？
You're coming to get me, right?

369
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:25,830
好的，我8點有個會議，我有很重要的事情要告訴你
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've something very important to tell you.

370
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,270
好的，我8點有個會議，我有很重要的事情要告訴你
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've something very important to tell you.

371
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,310
哦! 我也有很重要的事要告訴你
Oh! Even I've something very important to tell you.

372
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,690
好吧，我先說，求求你，求求你，讓我先說
OK, I'll go first. Please. Please. Let me go first!

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,350
好吧，去吧，好像我還有得選似的
OK, go. As if I have a choice.

374
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,240
說吧
Blurt out!

375
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,090
是這樣的……
Actually...

376
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
納文，我懷孕了
Naveen, I'm pregnant.

377
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,620
非常好
Very nice!

378
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,490
是誰的孩子？
Who's child is it?

379
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,250
我不知道..
I don't know...

380
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,230
誰都有可能
It could be anyone's.

381
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,370
可能是你的
It could be yours.

382
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,670
可能是拉哈夫的，也可能是瓦伊巴夫的
It could be Raghav's. It could be Vaibhav's.

383
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,310
哦，甚至可能是那個修道士的
Oh, it could even be the monastery monk's.

384
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,040
你有什麼重要的話要說，還是你隻是在浪費我流量
Do you have anything important to say or are you just eating into my internet pack?

385
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,820
不不不我確實有重要的事情要說
No. No. No. I do have something important to say.

386
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,830
但是我想要你一個驚喜
But I'd thought, that I'd keep it a surprise.

387
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,490
我應該告訴你嗎？
Should I tell you?

388
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,730
什麼? 你買了手銬？
What? You bought handcuffs?

389
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,980
是的，但除此之外..
Yeah, but apart from that...

390
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,750
是這樣的
So!

391
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,670
有個人，他要離開他的女朋友去巴西
There's this guy, who's leaving his girlfriend and moving to Brazil.

392
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,140
這個女孩，決定開始找工作
This girl, decides to start looking for a job.

393
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,540
在巴西
In Brazil.

394
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,280
還有，你猜怎麼著？
And, guess what?

395
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,810
她發現自己進入了最後的候選名單
She finds herself in the final shortlist.

396
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,670
史瑞雅! 等等
Shreya! Wait!

397
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,720
隻差一次電話麵試了，在那之後……
...last telephonic interview is left, but after that...

398
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,220
史瑞雅，等等
Shreya, wait.

399
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,490
- 她就跟你一起在裏約生活了!-等等等等
...going to live with you in Rio, bitch! - Wait. Wait. Wait.

400
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,070
等等，史瑞雅
Wait Shreya...

401
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,030
這正是我想告訴你的消息
This is exactly what I wanted to give you news about.

402
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,500
告訴我
Tell me.

403
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,480
呃..
Uh...

404
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,710
你在幹什麼..
What are you doing...

405
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,330
我正要洗呢
I was just about to wash them up

406
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,450
你還要幹多少活
How much will you work, after all!

407
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,490
洗衣機壞了，傭人也冇來..
Anyway, the machine isn't workiing and the maid hasn't come...

408
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,870
冇用多長時間……
It hardly takes time...

409
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,870
洗衣服……
I washed them...

410
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,030
怎麼回事? 你今天突然..
What's the deal? Suddenly today...

411
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,570
不是突然吧
It isn't really "suddenly"!

412
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,410
我前天做了雞肉
I'd cooked chicken, day before!

413
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,190
昨晚，我切的菜
And last night, I'd chopped the vegetables.

414
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
在一個家庭中，如果兩個人一起做事，就冇那麼纍了
In a household, if 2 people work in unison, it becomes easy.

415
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,850
現在有了各種各樣的機器……
These days, these machines have come up...

416
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,130
否則..
Otherwise...

417
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,900
我們的父輩以前都是用手做的
Our dads used to do it all, by hands.

418
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,640
你怎麼不去..
Why don't you go...

419
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,600
去祈禱吧，等我做完這裏的事，我就去泡茶
Go do your prayers. I'll come, make tea, once I'm done here.

420
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,920
你有什麼事要跟我說的嗎？
Do you have something, to tell me?

421
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,850
冇有啊
No!

422
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,630
你為什麼這麼想？
Why would you think so?

423
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
給我
Give me.

424
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,630
納文... 給我打電話..
Naveen... had called...

425
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,060
尤吉和納文已經辭職了
Yogi and Naveen have quit their jobs...

426
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,920
準備開始創業
They're going to begin their own start-up...

427
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
他們問了我……要不要一起
They were asking me... as well

428
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,470
你下樓去吧，我來搞定
You go on downstairs. I'll get done here.

429
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,030
你剛才說什麼？
So what were you saying?

430
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,930
我剛才說什麼來著..
What was I saying...

431
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,840
哦對……
No...

432
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,070
納文和其他人問了我
Naveen and the guys were asking me as well...

433
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,080
要不要辭掉工作，加入他們的公司做CTO
To quit my job and join them as the C.T.O.

434
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,960
但是現在..
But now...

435
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
這... 你什麼時候買的？
This... When did you buy this?

436
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,680
這是舊的
This is an old one!

437
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,600
從我父母那來的
Had gotten it from my parents'.

438
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,000
不... ... 我是說... ... 這顔色很適合你... ... 很好看
No... I was saying... These colors suit you... They come out very well!

439
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,760
那你怎麼說？
So what did you say?

440
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,860
我說，我會考慮的... 現在這事情..
I said, I'll think about it... Now things like...

441
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,180
不能一下子就決定了
...these can't just be decided in the moment.

442
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,300
所以我也想和你談談這個
So I wanted to talk to you as well, about this.

443
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,440
這對你的職業發展有益嗎
Will you be benefited, in your career?

444
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,900
如果初創企業發展壯大，那麼是有好處的
If the start-up goes big, then there's a benefit...

445
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
否則，這就隻是在冒險
Otherwise, it's just a risk!

446
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,450
工作會很有趣
Well, the work will be a lot of fun...

447
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,570
一定會很有趣的，但是薪水..
It'll be interesting but the salary...

448
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,310
我認為你應該去
I think you should do it.

449
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,330
什麼？
What?

450
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,300
你搞錯了
You're not doing it right...

451
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,520
給我
Give it to me!

452
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,340
不是……
No...

453
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,350
你剛才說什麼？
What were you saying?

454
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,260
我認為，你應該去創業
I think, you should do it.

455
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
哈？
No...

456
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,310
真的冇問題嗎？
You don't have any problem?

457
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,300
我是想說……
I was trying to say, that once...

458
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,840
如果我辭職了，我們買房子的計劃就要推遲了
...I quit my job, our plan to buy a house will be delayed.

459
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,820
為什麼要急著買房子呢？
So, what's the hurry in buying a house?

460
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,870
不管怎麼說，現在這房子也不錯
Anyway, this is such a nice house.

461
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,900
這麼大的陽臺
There's such a big terrace!

462
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,440
而且你成長的機會，也會更多
And then the chances of your growth, are also so much more.

463
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,720
我連自助餐都冇有
I won't even get an L.T.A.

464
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,600
我們也不得不取消毛裏求斯之旅
We'll have to drop our Mauritius trip, as well.

465
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,360
我們還是去馬哈巴萊斯赫瓦爾吧
We'll go to Mahabaleshwar, instead.

466
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,230
沙利尼的丈夫有一個渡假村在那
Shalini's husband owns a resort there.

467
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,310
但薪水問題仍然是個問題
But the salary issue will still persist.

468
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,280
我們的儲蓄足夠了
Our savings are good enough.

469
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,570
不管怎樣，我來孟買已經5個月了
Anyway, it's been 5 months since I've come to Mumbai.

470
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
我在想..
I'm thinking...

471
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,690
要出去找份工作
...of getting a good job for myself.

472
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,830
這些是怎麼掛的? 用夾子嗎？
How do you hang these? By clips?

473
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,500
我還以為你不會同意呢
I thought, you wouldn't agree to this.

474
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,250
我甚至還準備了流程圖，用來說服你
I even had my flowcharts ready, so that I could convince you!

475
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,310
我從星期一開始就一直在想這個問題
I've only been thinking about this, since Monday.

476
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,330
所有的努力都白費了
All the effort, went waste!

477
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,000
別擔心
Don't worry.

478
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,170
你的努力不會白費
None of your effort will go waste.

479
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,890
不管怎樣..
Anyway...

480
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,140
你還得和你爸爸談談..
You'll have to talk to your dad about this...

481
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,930
你不會不問他就辭職吧？
You wouldn't quit your job, without asking him, would you?

482
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,390
拜托你做事靠譜一些好不好
I was asking you to do it properly!

483
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,200
現在我又得洗衣服了，全都要重洗
Now I'll have to wash, all the clothes again!

484
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,410
傭人今天都冇來
Even the maid's not come today!

485
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,100
撤下所有的講座然後換成色情視頻
...got down all the lectures, and uploaded youporn videos, instead.

486
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,110
這小夥子贏了 IBM 代碼競賽兩次以上..
Our guy's won the IBM code competition, twice over...

487
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
還是連續的
...in a row.

488
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,410
據說他收到了埃裏克 · 施密特的祝賀信
Legend says that he got a congratulatory mail from Eric Schmidt, himself.

489
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
但是他冇有隨機的期望，不是嗎？
But he doesn't have random expectations, does he?

490
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,500
他知道除了基本生活津貼他什麼都拿不到對吧？
He knows, he won't get anything more than the basic stipend, right?

491
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,470
放鬆點! 他是自己人
Dude, relax! He's our kid!

492
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,510
我們請他吃幾頓燒烤，他就會答應的
We'll offer him a couple of treats at Barbeque Nation and he'll say yes!

493
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,500
我告訴他，這是一個環境科學講座，狗娘養的..
I told him, it's an Environment Science lecture motherf**ker...

494
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,610
如果不是代理，我是不是該打你屁股？
If not proxy, should I whoop your arse?

495
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,220
羅漢·奈吉的房間在這邊嗎？
Is Rohan Negi's room this way?

496
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,580
他在等你嗎？
Is he expecting you?

497
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,090
是的
Yes.

498
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,290
跟我來
Follow me!

499
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,790
你去死吧
You go to hell!

500
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,110
我不想再見到你
I don't want to see your face again!

501
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,080
你不滿足於隻有前戲，是嗎？
You aren't satisfied only with foreplay, are you?

502
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,070
你還得有個後續
You have to have this afterplay of melodrama!

503
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,690
她生氣了，因為那是草莓味的
She got mad because it was strawberry.

504
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,490
隻有杏仁或者開心果，而不是冰淇淋
It isn't ice-cream that you'd get almond and pistachio flavours!

505
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,430
叔叔們，有火柴嗎？
Does the uncle party, have matchsticks?

506
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,470
快去食堂，時間到了
Go run to the canteen. It's time!

507
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,520
叔叔，給他一百塊錢
Uncle, give him a 100 bucks.

508
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,710
掏錢
Give it.

509
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,260

Follow me!

510

我不能再往前走了
I can't go beyond this point.

511
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,280
把你的手機、U盤和硬盤等等任何儲存設備都拿出來
Deposit your mobiles, pendrives, hard-disks and any other storage devices.

512
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,280
前麵那扇門
There's a door ahead...

513
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,200
敲門
Knock it.

514
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,410
敲兩下
Twice!

515
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,710
然後等著
And then wait.

516
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,370
你們抽煙嗎？
Do you smoke?

517
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,230
不抽
No.

518
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,000
辣雞
Kids!

519
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,420
什麼事？
Yes?

520

告訴欽圖，尤吉·拜亞來了，給他一個實習機會
Tell chintu, that 'Yogi bhaiyaa' is here, to give him an internship.

進來吧
Come in.

522
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
坐
Sit.

523
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,370
他正在忙..
He's in the middle of something...

524
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,200
給他75
Give him 75.

525
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,740
分鍾？
Minutes?

526
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,670
爆頭數
Headshots!

527
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,400
盡管我是班長，但我從6年級到12年級的成績穩步提高..
Despite being the class monitor, my performance from class 6 to class 12 steadily increased...

530

... 專註，積極，超越..
...dedicated, motivated, over...

533
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,220
被低估……
Under-rated dude!

534
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,410
有責任心，堅持不懈，積極主動，敬業樂業

嗨，曼達爾
Hi Mandal!

537
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,050
嗨..
Hi...

538
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,760
對不起，我不是有意打擾你幻想幻燈片的
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb your paranormal powerpoint fantasy.

539
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,340
我會偷偷霤進納文的房間然後鎖上門，這樣你就不能進來了
I'll just sneak into Naveen's room and lock the door, so you can't come in!

540
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
不不不
No. No. No.

541
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,180
事實上，我是在等你
Actually, I was waiting for you!

542
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,420
納文告訴我你會來
Naveen'd told me that you're going to come.

543
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,770
穿著那件運動夾克和毛巾？
In that blazer and towel?

544
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,650
你不是連環殺手曼達爾吧？
You aren't a serial killer Mandal, are you?

545
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,450
隻有外錶能殺人
Only, if looks could kill!

546
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,840
請坐
Please have a seat!

547
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,440
事實上，如果我感到緊張，我要去洗個澡
Actually, if I get tensed, I need to have a bath!

548
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,570
好點了嗎？
Better?

549
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,680
恭喜你，曼達爾
Congratulations Mandal.

550
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,250
你已經到了令人毛骨悚然的新境界
You've reached a new level of creepy!

551
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,320
那麼……
Soo...

552
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,060
納文辭職去..
Naveen's quit his job to...

553
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,190
我知道，他什麼都告訴我了
Yeah, I know. He's told me everything.

554
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,410
我也想..
And I too, want to...

555
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:02,440
所有的一切
Everything!

556
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,410
所有的一切
Everything!

557
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,920
那麼……
Soo...

558
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,760
那又怎樣？
So?

559
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,130
史瑞雅，我們是朋友，對吧？
Shreya. We're friends, aren't we?

560
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,170
在 facebook 上還是在現實生活中？
Facebook-wise or in real life?

561
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,820
別鬨
Joke!

562
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,500
你還記得嗎？
Do you remember?

563
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,210
上個月，某個清晨..
Last month, early morning...

564
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,220
你想複印你的 PAN 卡
You wanted a Xerox of your PAN card.

565
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,630
納文正在睡覺
Naveen was sleeping.

566
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,760
所以你找我幫忙
So you asked me for help.

567
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,350
我上班要遲到了..
I was getting late for work...

568
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,550
我身上冇帶零錢
I didn't have any change on me...

569
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,670
但我還是去把複印機弄好了
I still went and got the Xerox done.

570
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,320
聽著，我有一個哲學理論
Look, I've this one philosophy...

571
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,530
朋友應該互相幫助
Friends should always help each other!

572
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,060
不不不不不
No. No. No. No. No.

573
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,350
等一下
One second.

574
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,620
你想讓我說服納文帶你創業？
You want me to convince Naveen to hire you?

575
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,070
不行
No.

576
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,420
對不起
Sorry.

577
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,490
想都不要想
Not gonna happen.

578
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,740
想都不要想
Not gonna happen.

579
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,130
不管怎樣，我不能說服他，相反，他最終會說服我
Anyway, I can't convince him. Instead, he'll end up convincing me!

580
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,160
史瑞雅... 相信我
Shreya... Trust me!

581
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,000
他絕對不能說服你
He can never convince you!

582
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,970
男人永遠都不能說服給了他……
A man can never convince a woman, who gives him...

583
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,070
... 愛的女人
...Love!

584
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,370
如果..
And if...

585
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
他不動搖的話……
He doesn't budge...

586
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,760
你知道..
You know...

587
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,120
用你的方法……
Use your methods!

588
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,400
什麼方法？
What methods?

589
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,050
性交
Intercourse

590
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,470
什麼？
What?

591
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,060
曼達爾，你瘋了嗎？
Mandal, have you gone nuts?

592
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,600
那個隻要1塊錢的複印機..
Just for a 1 buck Xerox...

593
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,700
實際上是兩塊錢，要複印兩麵呢
It's actually 2 bucks. One for each side!

594
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,310
我的價值遠不止這些
I'm worth much more than that!

595
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,200
好嗎? 對不起
OK? I'm sorry.

596
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
我可以幫你做其他的事情，但是這件事，我做不到! 對不起
I would've helped you with anything else, but with this, I can't! Sorry.

597
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,070
納文需要我的幫助
Naveen needs my help!

598
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,030
尤吉一直從中作梗不讓我加入
Yogi keeps winding him up against me!

599
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,100
我真的很想成為其中的一員
I really want to be a part of this!

600
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,240
我知道，我一定會後悔的
I know, I'm gonna regret this.

601
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,320
好吧
OK.

602
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,700
好吧
Alright.

603
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,210
我要確認一件事
Tell me one thing.

604
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,410
你會在什麼時候……
When do...

605
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,560
叫水管工？
You call for a plumber?

606
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
那不是我..
That wasn't me...

607
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,030
納文以為我弄壞了他的噴霧然後..
Naveen thinks that I broke his jet spray and then...

608
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,550
不，我是說假設
No. I mean hypothetically.

609
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,290
我是說..
I mean...

610
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,860
什麼時候會有人叫水管工？
When would anyone, call for a plumber?

611
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,090
水龍頭壞了，就叫水管工來
One calls for the plumber when a tap's broken.

612
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,690
對，如果水龍頭冇壞呢？
Right. And what if a tap isn't broken?

613
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,280
那為什麼要叫水管工？
Then why call the plumber?

614
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
冇錯
Exactly!

615
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,900
你看
Look.

616
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,640
在這種情況下..
In this situation...

617
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,570
你是水管工，但納文的公司並冇有壞掉的水龍頭
You're the plumber and Naveen's start-up doesn't have any broken tap.

618
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,950
無論你在生活中所做的貢獻有多麼偉大
Irrespective of, however great, the work you're doing in life is...

619
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,290
除非你的加入能解決他們的問題..
Unless, your inclusion doesn't solve any of their problems...

620
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,820
否則他們就不會需要你
They don't need you!

621
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,710
你要弄清楚他們需要什麼
See... You need to figure out what they need.

622
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,680
你還需要一條更大的毛巾
You also need a bigger towel, dude!

623
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,860
別走
No. No.

624
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
不要回避
Don't shy away!

625
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,610
我穿著內褲呢
I'm wearing my underwear!

626
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,690
對不起
Sorry.

627
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,040
冇穿
Not wearing any!

628
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
幹你娘
F**K!

629
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,710
去你丫的
F**K!

630
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,590
尤吉
Yogi!

631
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,690
還有..
And...

632
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,600
你一定是納文
You must be Naveen.

633
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,120
你好呀欽圖，我上次在穿線儀式上見過你
How are you 'chintu'? I saw you at the threading ceremony, last.

634
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,150
不是欽圖
Not 'chintu'.

635
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,110
地下城主
Dungeon Master.

636
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,550
在地下城和主人之間有一個下劃線
There's an underscore between Dungeon and Master.

637
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,900
所以..
So...

638
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,000
你們想讓我為你們公司工作
You guys want me to work for your company.

639
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,410
你跟他講
You tell him.

640
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,930
我們有興趣討論一下..
We were interested in discussing the possibilities...

641
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,000
我研究了你的想法
I looked into your idea.

642
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,900
其實挺有意思的
It's... quite interesting actually.

643
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,880
研究過了嗎？
Looked into?

644
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
但是，到目前為止，我還冇有給你發過郵件
But, I haven't sent you any mail, as yet!

645
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,840
但是你已經給 NASSCOM 發過了，不是嗎？
But you'd mailed NASSCOM, hadn't you?

646
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
你看..
You see...

647
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,590
郵件隱私是個神話，我的朋友
Privacy on mail is a myth my friend!

648
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,420
所以... 如果我加入你們..
So... If I join you guys...

649
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,000
我有什麼好處
How do I benefit?

650
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,210
我能得到什麼？
What do I get?

651
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,390
機會
Opportunity!

652
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,250
當然，一開始也會有一筆津貼
Of course, there'll also be a stipend initially.

653
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,410
大約... 7仟塊

654
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,030
8... 8仟
8... 8K. Yeah.

655
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,880
隨著我們公司的發展，你們的工資也會增加
And as we grow, your monetory compensation will obviously increase...

656
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
你知道國際反恐精英大賽的獎金是多少嗎？
Do you know what's the prize money for the Internation Counter Strike competition?

657
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,870
多少錢？
How much?

658
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,090
475,000...
475,000...

659
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
美元
Dollars.

660
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,140
4... 4乘以6等於24..
4... 4 times 6 is 24...

661
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,430
你贏了？
And you won that?

662
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,550
兩次
Twice!

663
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,280
4... 4乘2等於8... 8乘6等於48..
4... 4 times 2 is 8... 8 times 6 is 48...

664
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,940
所以理論上來說... 我可以雇傭你們
So theoritically... I can hire you guys.

665
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,230
而不是你雇傭我
But not the other way round.

666
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,140
我要30% 的股權
I want 30% equity...

667
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,050
還有... 否決産品設計

668
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,520
Dungeon_master@hotmail.com

669
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,060
不要忘記下劃線
Don't forget the underscore.

670
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,220
星期一之前給我發郵件
Mail me by Monday.

671
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,830
或者把它保存在你的草稿中
Or just save it in your drafts.

672
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,080
我會看的
I'll read it.

673
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,500
我想我們需要傑圖
I think we need Jeetu.

674
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,500
你認為我們需要傑圖嗎？
Do you think we need Jeetu?

675
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,920
我們需要傑圖
We need Jeetu.

676
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,010
我們必須先更改所有賬戶的密碼
We'll have to first change the passwords for all our accounts.

677
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,160
怎麼了，創業者？
What's up, start-up founder?

678
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
談完這筆交易後，你們的電池看起來冇電了
Your battery looks dead after listeninig to the deal.

679
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,060
怎麼了，企業家叔叔？
What's up, entrepreneur uncle?

680
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
給我們也分一些股份吧
Pass on some stake to us as well!

681
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,510
聽著，傑圖，冇有別的出路了，你必須加入進來
Listen up Jeetu. There's no other way out. You have to join in.

682
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,890
我不能參加了
I can't join in.

683
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,970
對不起
Sorry.

684
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,060
我告訴過你
I told you!

685
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,010
你永遠不能說服一個跟你上床的女人
You can never convince a woman who gives you sex!

686
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,050
不
Noo!

687
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,580
桑亞已經同意了
Suamya has agreed.

688
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
所以呢？
SO?

689
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,970
哦
Ohh!

690
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,850
什麼？
What?

691
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,910
你有冇有試著和他談談？
Did you try talking to him?

692
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,120
這就是我從一歲半開始一直想做的事情
That's all I've been able to do since I was 1.5 years old. TRY to talk!

693
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
和誰？
With whom?

694
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,610
你冇看過《烏丹》嗎？
Haven't you watched 'Udaan'?

695
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,090
哦
Ohhhh!

696
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
你爸爸？
Your dad?

697
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,640
他酗酒？
He's alcoholic?

698
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,890
他不是酒鬼..
He's not alcoholic...

699
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,350
你為什麼害怕你爸爸? 你還是個孩子嗎？
Why are you scared of your dad? Are you still a kid?

700
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,690
納文，我的存摺都在他那裏
Naveen. Even my passbook is with him.

701
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,000
如果下個月一號我的工資還冇有到賬
If my salary doesn't get credited on the 1st of the next month...

702
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,730
我就得用命來頂
My life will get debited.

703
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,500
你們先開始吧
You guys, atleast, start.

704
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,830
我會試著每天下班後投入幾個小時的工作
I'll see. I'll try putting in a couple of hours of work, everyday after my job.

705
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,040
”你們先做””我等等看”你瘋了嗎？
"You guys start", "I'll see". Are you mad?

706
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,280
這樣的話，即使是測試版6個月之內也做不好
This way, even the Beta version won't be ready in 6 months.

707
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,580
還有很多事情要做
There's so much to do.

708
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,440
不好意思
Excuse me!

709
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,520
這不是印度曆史上最酷的公司嗎？
Aren't you the guys launching the coolest company of Indian history?

710
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,000
嘿! 創業的太太來了-嘿
Hey! The start-up wags are here. -Hey!

711
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,220
那些拜金主義者甚至比錢還早到這裏
The gold-diggers are here even before the money.

712
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,260
聽著，你需要一個更好的首席執行官
Listen, you need to get a better CEO, though!

713
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,540
不知道是不是最酷的，但肯定是最短命的
Don't know about the coolest, but could be most short-lived for sure!

714
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,290
不要在這樣的好日子裏說喪氣話，傑圖
Don't say such bad things on a good day like this, Jeetu.

715
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,580
這是給你的
This is for you'll.

716
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,960
怎麼了，傑圖？
So what's up, Jeetu?

717
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,480
你在這兒幹什麼？
What are you doing here?

718
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,620
我是來麵試的
I've come here for the interview!

719
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,410
曼達爾，那隻是個玩笑，不會有麵試的
Mandal, that was only a joke. There's no interview happening.

720
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,390
我知道，我知道
I know. I know.

721
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
我懂笑話
I know jokes.

722
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,860
我上了一個月的即興喜劇課
I've taken improv. comedy classes for a month.

723
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,870
這有人嗎?-有
Is this taken? -Yes.

724
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,960
好的
OK!

725
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,490
你還不明白嗎，混蛋？
Don't you get it, motherf**ker?

726
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,460
我們的電池冇電了
Anyway our battery's down...

727
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,490
這是我們的事，曼達爾
This is our shit, Madal!

728
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,650
我們不需要你
We don't need you.

729
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
相信我
Trust me.

730
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,990
你需要我
You need me!

731
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,510
事實上冇有我..
Infact without me...

732
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,590
你冇有公司
You don't have a company!

733
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,920
好吧，去拿把椅子來
OK, go get a chair.

734
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,030
我們現在麵試你
We'll interview you right away!

735
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,920
聽他把話說完，就一次
Just hear him out na, once.

736
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,330
告訴我
Tell me.

737
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,530
我們為什麼要雇傭你？
Why should we hire you?

738
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,020
作為一個工商管理碩士
You know, as an MBA...

739
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,410
我一直對我的角色與責任很清楚
I've always had a clarity about my R&Rs.

740
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:21,620
我的一個主要關鍵領域出了問題..
One of my KRA has been problem...

741
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,410
我的一個主要關鍵領域出了問題..
One of my KRA has been problem...

742
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:22,450
我們不需要市場經理，我們需要一個程序員..
We don't need a marketing manager. We need a coder...

743
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,340
我們不需要市場經理，我們需要一個程序員..
We don't need a marketing manager. We need a coder...

744
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,490
謝謝你的申請，麵試結束
Thanks for applying. You interview's over.

745
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,520
不不不等一下
No. No. No. One second.

746
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,790
我可以解決你的問題
I can solve your problem.

747
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,860
我可以給你一些你需要的東西
I can give you something, which you need.

748
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,360
我可以給你傑圖
I can give you Jeetu!

749
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,070
怎麼做？
How?

750
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,220
現階段，你不會得到任何投資..
Till the time, you'll don't get an investment...

751
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,080
由我來付傑圖的工資
I'll pay for Jeetu's salary.

752
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,900
一部分是我的工資，另一部分是我的積蓄
A part of it through my salary and a part through my savings.

753
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,030
但我保證，傑圖現在的工資是多少，我就給他多少
But I'll ensure that, Jeetu keeps getting as much as he gets from his company.

754
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,130
曼達爾你為什麼要為我們做這些事？
Mandal. Why would you do these things for us?

755
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,230
不是為你們
Not for you guys...

756
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,560
我是為了我自己
I'll do it for myself!

757
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,130
你們是我最好的朋友
You guys are the best friends I've ever had.

758
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,550
我知道除了納文
I know, apart from Naveen...

759
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,650
我們並冇有很多交流的機會
We've not interacted as much...

760
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,260
但是我一直認為，我們四個是一個非常好的團隊
But I've always thought, that the four of us are a very good team.

761
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,520
當我看《人隻活一次》的時候
You know when I'd seen 'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'

762
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,060
我決定..
I'd decided that...

763
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,180
我們四個也是，就像電影主角一樣……
The four of us too, just like them...

764
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,430
開創一番事業
Would go on a trip.

765
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,840
但是主角隻有3個人
But ZNMD had only 3 guys.

766
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,790
好吧，那麼... 就三個主角
OK. Then... like 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

767
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,350
再說一次，隻有三個人，曼達爾
Again, only 3 guys, Mandal.

768
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,230
搖滾樂隊肯定有4個人
'Rock On' definitely had 4 guys.

769
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,860
第四個得了癌癥死了，隻剩下三個
The 4th one, gets cancer and dies. Only 3 remain.

770
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,540
重點是如果我加入你們的初創公司
The point is, if I join your start-up...

771
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,970
這樣傑圖就可以全職和我們一起工作了
Then Jeetu can work full-time with us.

772
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,790
不是所有的MBA都那麼糟糕
All MBAs... are not that bad.

773
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,990
那麼……
Soo...

774
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,470
有人要說什麼嗎，還是我們就這樣坐一個小時？
Is somebody going to say something, or are we sitting just like this for the next hour?

775
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
別擔心，夥計們
Don't worry, guys.

776
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,170
不會那麼糟的
It won't be that bad.

777
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,740
後街男孩... 歐耶
Backstreet Boys... Alright!

778
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
幹杯
Cheers!

779
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,510
我們有四個人啦
And then there were four!

780
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,820
幹杯! 幹杯! 幹杯
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

781
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,190
終於，他讓自己變得有用了
Finally, he's made himself useful!

782
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,570
好了，傑圖回來了
So, Jeetu's back!

783
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,960
最重要的一點 -這個消息不能從這裏傳出去
Important point - This news doesn't get out of here!

784
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,230
如果爸爸知道了... - 別再說什麼”爸爸爸爸”了
If dad gets to know... - Stop going "Dad. Dad."

785
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,440
一旦我們成為價值百萬美元的公司，你爸爸也會冷靜下來的
Once we're a million dollar company, even your dad will chill out!

786
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,580
此外，我還做了一些研究，為我們的公司想了幾個名字
And also, I've done some research and thought of a few names for our compnay.

787
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,930
我想，我們公司的名字裏應該有‘ le’
I think, our compnay name should have 'le' in it!

788
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,040
就像Google，Apple，Oracle
Like Google had 'gle', Apple has 'ple', Oracle has 'cle'

789
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,980
你在胡說些什麼? 你又開始用你那愚蠢的營銷邏輯了
What non-sense are you talking? You've started with your stupid marketing logics again!

790
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,000
請不要往我身上扔薯條，我是市場部經理
Please don't throw fries on me. I'm the marketing manager!

791
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,910
對不起
Oops! Sorry.

792
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,340
餵！為什麼要扔我
Careful! Why are you throwing it on me?

793
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,970
這就是你的百萬美元團隊？
So, this is your million dollar team?

794
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,550
恭喜
Congrats
