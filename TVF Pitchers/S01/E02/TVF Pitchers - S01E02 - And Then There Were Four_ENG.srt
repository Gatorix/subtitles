1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,410
You've told me about your start-up idea over a 100 times now.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,310
Why don't you do something about it?

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,580
How will I get the funding, Bhati?

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,580
Everyone's luck isn't as good as your's.

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,910
What are you?

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,030
What do you mean

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,980
You are a beer.

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,930
I will resign right now.

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,780
My B-Plan is going to get selected?

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,030
You should... -never quit

11
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:17,960
You should... -never quit

12
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,880
Guys!!!

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,510
I quit!!!

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,130
Now let's just begin with the start-up

15
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,680
We've only been talking about it since 3rd year. -Naveen we've already discussed this.

16
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,110
That by the time you come back from Brazil, after a

17
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,130
year and a half, Yogi will make some contacts here.

18
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,530
year and a half, Yogi will make some contacts here.

19
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,980
Guys try to understand, I can't leave my job right now.

20
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,300
People are realizing my potential.

21
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,560
I’m a valuable employee to the company.

22
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,300
Listen to me.

23
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,010
A new Silicon Valley is being upstaged at Hiranandani here!

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,060
And you're still writing codes on Python.

25
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,510
Whenever graduates of this country, get bored by their 9 to 5 jobs...

26
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,080
So, to get out, they come up with only three options for themselves.

27
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,680
MBA

28
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,110
IAS

29
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,130
or Start-Up.

30
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,910
Beijing.

31
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,380
We're beginning our expansion there, 6 months ahead of schedule.

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,910
Apointment within a week.

33
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,930
We need someone smart over there...

34
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,760
Like you.

35
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,160
Now is the real choice.

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,780
One in hand is obviously better than one not-so-sure in the bush.

37
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,360
He's the one who requested me to come here.

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,160
He...

39
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,750
... had to leave urgently.

40
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,280
Let me explain it to you, with beer today.

41
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,680
It won't burn, even if it spills.

42
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,610
You're back!!!

43
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,610
I knew it, you'd come!

44
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,110
Akhil gave us the wrong information!

45
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,610
Our name's not on the winner's list!

46
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:26,860
But wait...

47
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:27,960
What about my salary now?

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,390
MOM! I don't want to get married!!!

49
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,640
I'm only 27. Not even old enough to get married!

50
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,870
Don't "Shona beta" me!

51
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,590
Mummy... Mummy, don't lie to me, OK?

52
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,210
You don't have any Thyroid cancer!

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
OK wait... I'm getting another call.

54
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,720
Yeah... Wait! Wait!

55
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,680
Yeah Aarti?

56
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,430
Actually no. I'm still in a client meeting.

57
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,270
Where are you?

58
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,310
Oh, you've already reached?

59
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,120
Where?

60
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,020
OK. OK.

61
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,180
You've just reached, then?

62
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,460
No, no, no...

63
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,170
My client meeting... can be cancelled!

64
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,530
Yeah, I'm on my way!

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,440
Let's go.

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
We've to go around and then come back here!

67
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,700
Come on!

68
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,280
Come on already!

69
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,360
Hi!

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,880
Sorry, I got a little late.

71
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,910
Hope I didn't keep you waiting for long!

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,280
No!

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
Nice ambience!

74
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,970
Did you order anything?

75
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,240
Akhilesh, 2 cappuccinos!

76
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,020
No... I don't want to have anything!

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,430
No, no. Both are for me.

78
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,130
I'll drink one now, and the other one later, once it gets cold.

79
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,580
These guys charge 100 bucks extra for cold coffee!

80
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,170
By the way...

81
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,140
You look...

82
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,030
Quite different from your pictures!

83
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,980
I know!

84
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,890
I'm not photogenic!

85
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,740
I mean...

86
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,400
I look good in real life!

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,270
But my pictures, don't come out that great!

88
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,180
You've met guys before... like this?

89
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,100
Yes!

90
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,720
2-3 times

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Me too!

92
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,570
6 times!!!

93
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,960
You know...

94
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,940
Since I've completed my P.G. from IIM Indore?

95
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,360
Mom's had girls lined up for me to meet!

96
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,270
I told her, "Mom...

97
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,040
...I can't marry right now!...

98
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,330
...I want to explore the world...

99
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,510
...Travel with friends...

100
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,400
...Scuba dive...

101
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,180
...Sky dive"

102
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm telling you... You too should stop with this marraige shabang!

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,270
Marriage doesn't even make sense

104
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,860
Youngsters like us should have fun!

105
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,770
It's a good thing actually, that my mom forcefully made me a profie.

106
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,230
Or else, we wouldn't have been on this date!

107
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,760
Wait a minute!

108
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,640
Your mom... made your...

109
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,040
Tinder profile?

110
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,110
Tinder?

111
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,350
No, no. Shaadi.com

112
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:03,890
You're..

113
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,220
Hi.

114
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,450
Nikita?

115
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,040
Nikita.

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,910
Nikita?

117
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,590
Nikita.

118
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,290
Oh...

119
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,650
Oh shit... shit!

120
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,590
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

121
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,710
I got confused!

122
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,900
It's a good thing he showed up early!

123
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,780
We were about to get...

124
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,850
WE were about to get married!

125
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,340
Saurabh Mandal!

126
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,270
I'm a marketing head in Technity.

127
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,930
And what do you do?

128
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,300
Today's Thursday?

129
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,730
Yes.

130
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,110
On Thursdays I...

131
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,680
...do legs!

132
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,040
Gym!!!

133
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,150
Nice... Nice

134
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,230
Please have a seat! Enjoy!

135
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,220
Enjoy!

136
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,220
And have fun also.

137
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,160
Mr. Saurabh?

138
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,790
Aarti?

139
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,420
Actually, Aarti. I wanted to clear something first, before we start.

140
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,740
Mr. Saurabh, I know what you want to say.

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,820
That you've had girlfriends before this, isn't it?

142
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,850
I know.

143
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,130
No, not really. That's not it.

144
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,480
No, not really. That's not it.

145
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,890
How did you know that I like cappuccino?

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,180
Aarti, look...

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,320
I didn't want to come here in the first place

148
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,800
It's just that my mom wanted me to be here.

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,870
You know how parents pressurize you

150
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,370
Your...

151
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,780
Your moustache is just like Anil Kapoor's!

152
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,700
No look, Aarti...

153
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,540
Actually, I can't go ahead with this marriage!

154
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,940
Mr. Saurabh, I understand your reluctance!

155
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,190
How much sugar?

156
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,570
One.

157
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,690
Just like me!

158
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,750
Look, if I were to tell you the truth...

159
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,540
I too, had two boyfriends before this

160
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,830
And I got intimate with them, as well!

161
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,300
But we didn't do anything "dirty".

162
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,080
That I will do...

163
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,450
...only with my husband.

164
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,490
After all, I'm an Indian!

165
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,950
How can I forget my roots and culture

166
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,840
Aarti. No doubt, you're a very nice girl...

167
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,860
Panditji too, says the same

168
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,410
No, no. Now...

169
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:08,550
Now, I...

170
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,120
Now, I...

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,820
Mr. Saurabh, it's a yes for me.

172
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,620
Just...

173
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,090
Like the last guy...

174
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,840
Don't hide anything from me!

175
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,630
Why... What did the last one hide?

176
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,930
My marriage with him had been confirmed.

177
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,010
But just a few days before the engagement...

178
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,010
...dad got to know that...

179
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,490
...he was quitting a stable job to begin a start-up!

180
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,510
And the marriage got canned, then and there.

181
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,100
That's when I saw your profile and...

182
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,880
So what, if he was going to begin a start-up?

183
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,750
Why would any girl marry a "start-up guy"?

184
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,410
Now... If the company doesn't do well...

185
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,530
Will I have to leave my household chores and go do a job?

186
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,730
Will I have to leave my household chores and go do a job?

187
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,270
Tell me Mr. Saurabh?

188
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,740
Actually, Aarti...

189
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,500
This is exactly, what I wanted to tell you about...

190
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,630
No laundry from tomorrow!

191
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,600
No maid from tomorrow!

192
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,730
No milk from tomorrow!

193
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,860
Even, no newspaper from tomorrow!

194
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,220
Gym membership will be cancelled!

195
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,270
Metros will be used instead of the car!

196
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,630
Electricity will be saved!

197
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,960
Internet speed will be reduced from 8mbps to 1mbps!

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,450
No. No. No. No dude.

199
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,490
Atleast let the net speed stay!

200
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,070
Do you not want Jeetu, then?

201
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,880
If we don't save enough, how will we ensure his salary?

202
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,430
Alright then. Let's reduce the speed from 8mbps to 4mbps.

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Table top-ups will be stopped!

204
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,320
Ordering food from restaurants will be stopped!

205
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,010
Will be absolutely stopped!

206
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,140
Infact, all kinds of luxury expenditures will be absolutely stopped!

207
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,160
What's the total?

208
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
What's the total?

209
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,540
Three thousand

210
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,030
Seven hundred

211
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Twenty-five.

212
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,430
And adding my share to it...

213
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,150
Seven thousand

214
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:32,760
Four hundred

215
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:32,980
Fifty.

216
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,620
Fifty.

217
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,970
And how much is Jeetu's salary?

218
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,110
One lac

219
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,870
Thirty seven thousand

220
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,450
Five hundred.

221
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,030
Superb plan!

222
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,440
We'll save for a year and a half...

223
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,590
...and shell out one month's salary!

224
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,270
"Alright!"

225
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,630
"Alright!"

226
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,820
Madal, what are you doing dude?

227
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,360
What?

228
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,420
What are you doing?

229
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,320
Music!

230
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,640
Loud music!

231
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,980
Can't hear a thing!

232
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,120
You carrry on!

233
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
"Alright!"

234
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,290
What I'm saying is...

235
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,080
Let's add another 50 bucks to this...

236
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,980
And hire some intern to do the coding.

237
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,580
Yogi, an intern will replace Jeetu, now?

238
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:18,180
We need people with some work experience in our compnay!

239
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,050
People who've worked at some senior level!

240
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,670
Someone who can build a team in the future...

241
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,810
Someone who can strategize!

242
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,890
Naveen...

243
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,660
Did you find that t-shirt of mine?

244
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,390
What t-shirt?

245
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,990
The 'InfoCom' one.

246
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,150
Where I'd an experience of 4 years?

247
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,630
As a Senior Consultant!

248
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,840
Since I'd BUILT a team there...

249
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,000
They'd gifted that t-shirt to me.

250
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,140
I don't know dude. We're busy right now!

251
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
Shit!

252
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,950
Now, I'll have to strategize what to wear!

253
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,590
What do we do then?

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,790
Dude, I think we're getting a little impatient here!

255
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,330
I was thinking, what if...

256
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,880
Jeetu manages to convince Soumya!

257
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,790
Naveen...

258
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,260
She's his wife!

259
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
She gives him sex!

260
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,950
You can never convince a woman who gives you sex!

261
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,040
Trust me.

262
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,460
This is all coming from experience!

263
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Look Yogi...

264
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,600
Without Jeetu, we have no company.

265
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,500
Naveen...

266
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,700
We've no jobs.

267
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,060
We have to start a company, with or without Jeetu.

268
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,050
Yogi...

269
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,070
What are you doing?

270
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,440
Did you think about it?

271
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,660
I'd asked you something, yesterday?

272
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,820
What'd you asked?

273
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,890
That thing...

274
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,550
Can I be part of your start-up?

275
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,830
WHAT?

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,640
WHY?

277
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,210
What do you mean by "Why?"?

278
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,450
You all are engineers!

279
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,490
You need an MBA!

280
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,490
How will you'll run a company without business expertise?

281
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,640
Mandal, I'll let you know!

282
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,650
Give me some time.

283
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,660
It's a very important professional decision!

284
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,490
I'll let you know, alright? -OK

285
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,900
So will you send me a mail, or you'll communicate verbally?

286
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,110
Should I expect a call by Friday?

287
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,740
I'll...

288
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,950
Why Friday? He's a sweet kid!

289
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,450
Let's do your G.D. and P.I. today itself!

290
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,120
And the results tomorrow.

291
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,700
Personal interview, today?

292
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,680
Iit's already 10. When will I prepare...

293
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,910
Fuck, it's 10 already?

294
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,410
I'm going to get killed!

295
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,890
What if it's 10?

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,100
'Jhalak' comes up only at 10 in the night!

297
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,370
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If I get late, she'll screw me!

298
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,680
No Yogi! I've to meet Shreya. If I get late, she'll screw me!

299
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,460
Haven't you told her already, about our start-up?

300
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,810
Where have I met her, since so many days?

301
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,110
MANDAL!

302
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,400
Where's my face-wash dude?

303
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,490
The 'Kurule' medical therapy one?

304
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't use that!

305
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,960
I used it and 4 of my pimples combined into a boil!

306
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,340
No dude. My face-wash!

307
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,120
Will you get it, or should we disqualify you before the interview round, itself?

308
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,930
I was just about to go!

309
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
Dude, look...

310
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,520
There's this coder...

311
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,490
He's in the third year.

312
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,520
He's the son of the paternal uncle of a mutual friend!

313
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,850
He's almost family!

314
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,460
Let's get him onboard. I assure you, he'll rock!

315
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Look, Yogi!

316
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,290
A comapny's all about the people in it.

317
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,240
You think, any college guy can replace Jeetu...

318
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,900
If that's how randomly we want to hire people, why don't we hire Mandal as well?

319
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,440
Sorry to disturb your important meeting!

320
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,040
But I hope you take the right decision!

321
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,890
I also love Jeetu!

322
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,730
Though 3 years late, I've passed by cheating from his answer sheet.

323
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,460
We definitely want him onboard.

324
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,790
But till the time we do not ensure his salary, we need a coder.

325
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,720
I'm telling you...

326
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,460
Let's go meet this guy...

327
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,500
And let's get the fucking thing started!

328
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,370
OK, alright.

329
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,650
Let me meet Shreya for now.

330
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,710
After that, let's go meet this guy, in the afternoon. OK?

331
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,370
How do I look?

332
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,210
Fair!

333
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,480
OK. You make a move, I'll go meet Shreya and then catch you!

334
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,510
Go. Go. Go. Go.

335
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,010
Hello?

336
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,030
Naveen!!! - Hey Shreya!

337
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,170
You still haven't upgraded your internet, have you?

338
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,430
How are you?

339
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,410
You've always been and always will be a miser!

340
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,410
Can you see me?

341
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,370
Wait a second.

342
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,840
You can see me?

343
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
I can see you now.

344
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh God, what is that shirt you're wearing?

345
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,150
Have you borrowed it from the gardenkeeper?

346
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,280
Actually, his and mine shirt size is the same. So it fit me!

347
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,170
By the way, his wife wears XL. Looks like that too, will fit you!

348
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,630
If only you had something XL, no?

349
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,760
Baby, I have my heart.

350
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,740
My heart is so big.

351
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,750
OK, you should know, that I haven't been looking for

352
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,890
wi-fi all over Bhutan, to listen to all these ridicules.

353
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,460
Yeah, as if I asked to go to Bhutan!

354
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,490
Meditation is being learnt, with Consultancy Project only as an excuse.

355
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,800
If it's meditation that you wanted to learn, you could've done that

356
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,380
just by waking up in the mornings to watch 'Ramdev baba' on the T.V.

357
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,580
Yeah, because I just love old, hairy men sweating at 6 in the morning!

358
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,620
Why do you think I sleep with you, baby?

359
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,170
Baby, I thought you sleep with me, because not

360
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
a lot of men, believe in doing charity, no?

361
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh, you want me to start counting down on the charity cases?

362
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,820
Should we start listing your dating history, now? -No, no, no, no...

363
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,250
When is my true love, by tearing through clouds...

364
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,340
Landing on the grounds of this country, we call India!

365
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,280
Four O'clock!

366
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:24,860
Sharp!

367
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,570
You're coming to get me, right?

368
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:25,830
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've something very important to tell you.

369
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,270
Ok, I've a meeting at 8 and I've something very important to tell you.

370
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,310
Oh! Even I've something very important to tell you.

371
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,690
OK, I'll go first. Please. Please. Let me go first!

372
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,350
OK, go. As if I have a choice.

373
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,240
Blurt out!

374
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,090
Actually...

375
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,130
Naveen, I'm pregnant.

376
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,620
Very nice!

377
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,490
Who's child is it?

378
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,250
I don't know...

379
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,230
It could be anyone's.

380
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,370
It could be yours.

381
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,670
It could be Raghav's. It could be Vaibhav's.

382
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,310
Oh, it could even be the monastery monk's.

383
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,040
Do you have anything important to say or are you just eating into my internet pack?

384
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,820
No. No. No. I do have something important to say.

385
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,830
But I'd thought, that I'd keep it a surprise.

386
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,490
Should I tell you?

387
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,730
What? You bought handcuffs?

388
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,980
Yeah, but apart from that...

389
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,750
So!

390
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,670
There's this guy, who's leaving his girlfriend and moving to Brazil.

391
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,140
This girl, decides to start looking for a job.

392
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,540
In Brazil.

393
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,280
And, guess what?

394
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,810
She finds herself in the final shortlist.

395
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,670
Shreya! Wait!

396
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,720
...last telephonic interview is left, but after that...

397
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,220
Shreya, wait.

398
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,490
...going to live with you in Rio, bitch! - Wait. Wait. Wait.

399
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,070
Wait Shreya...

400
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,030
This is exactly what I wanted to give you news about.

401
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,500
Tell me.

402
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,480
Uh...

403
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,710
What are you doing...

404
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,330
I was just about to wash them up

405
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,450
How much will you work, after all!

406
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,490
Anyway, the machine isn't workiing and the maid hasn't come...

407
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,870
It hardly takes time...

408
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,870
I washed them...

409
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,030
What's the deal? Suddenly today...

410
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,570
It isn't really "suddenly"!

411
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,410
I'd cooked chicken, day before!

412
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,190
And last night, I'd chopped the vegetables.

413
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
In a household, if 2 people work in unison, it becomes easy.

414
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,850
These days, these machines have come up...

415
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,130
Otherwise...

416
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,900
Our dads used to do it all, by hands.

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,640
Why don't you go...

418
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,600
Go do your prayers. I'll come, make tea, once I'm done here.

419
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,920
Do you have something, to tell me?

420
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,850
No!

421
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,630
Why would you think so?

422
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Give me.

423
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,630
Naveen... had called...

424
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,060
Yogi and Naveen have quit their jobs...

425
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,920
They're going to begin their own start-up...

426
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
They were asking me... as well

427
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,470
You go on downstairs. I'll get done here.

428
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,030
So what were you saying?

429
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,930
What was I saying...

430
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,840
No...

431
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,070
Naveen and the guys were asking me as well...

432
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,080
To quit my job and join them as the C.T.O.

433
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,960
But now...

434
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,360
This... When did you buy this?

435
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,680
This is an old one!

436
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,600
Had gotten it from my parents'.

437
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,000
No... I was saying... These colors suit you... They come out very well!

438
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,760
So what did you say?

439
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,860
I said, I'll think about it... Now things like...

440
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,180
...these can't just be decided in the moment.

441
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,300
So I wanted to talk to you as well, about this.

442
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,440
Will you be benefited, in your career?

443
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,900
If the start-up goes big, then there's a benefit...

444
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
Otherwise, it's just a risk!

445
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,450
Well, the work will be a lot of fun...

446
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,570
It'll be interesting but the salary...

447
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,310
I think you should do it.

448
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,330
What?

449
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,300
You're not doing it right...

450
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,520
Give it to me!

451
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,340
No...

452
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,350
What were you saying?

453
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,260
I think, you should do it.

454
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
No...

455
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,310
You don't have any problem?

456
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,300
I was trying to say, that once...

457
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,840
...I quit my job, our plan to buy a house will be delayed.

458
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,820
So, what's the hurry in buying a house?

459
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,870
Anyway, this is such a nice house.

460
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,900
There's such a big terrace!

461
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,440
And then the chances of your growth, are also so much more.

462
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,720
I won't even get an L.T.A.

463
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,600
We'll have to drop our Mauritius trip, as well.

464
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,360
We'll go to Mahabaleshwar, instead.

465
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,230
Shalini's husband owns a resort there.

466
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,310
But the salary issue will still persist.

467
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,280
Our savings are good enough.

468
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,570
Anyway, it's been 5 months since I've come to Mumbai.

469
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
I'm thinking...

470
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,690
...of getting a good job for myself.

471
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,830
How do you hang these? By clips?

472
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,500
I thought, you wouldn't agree to this.

473
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,250
I even had my flowcharts ready, so that I could convince you!

474
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,310
I've only been thinking about this, since Monday.

475
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,330
All the effort, went waste!

476
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't worry.

477
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,170
None of your effort will go waste.

478
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,890
Anyway...

479
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,140
You'll have to talk to your dad about this...

480
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,930
You wouldn't quit your job, without asking him, would you?

481
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,390
I was asking you to do it properly!

482
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,200
Now I'll have to wash, all the clothes again!

483
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,410
Even the maid's not come today!

484
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,100
...got down all the lectures, and uploaded youporn videos, instead.

485
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,110
Our guy's won the IBM code competition, twice over...

486
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,180
...in a row.

487
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,410
Legend says that he got a congratulatory mail from Eric Schmidt, himself.

488
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,960
But he doesn't have random expectations, does he?

489
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,500
He knows, he won't get anything more than the basic stipend, right?

490
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,470
Dude, relax! He's our kid!

491
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,510
We'll offer him a couple of treats at Barbeque Nation and he'll say yes!

492
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,500
I told him, it's an Environment Science lecture motherf**ker...

493
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,610
If not proxy, should I whoop your arse?

494
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,220
Is Rohan Negi's room this way?

495
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,580
Is he expecting you?

496
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,090
Yes.

497
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,290
Follow me!

498
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,790
You go to hell!

499
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,110
I don't want to see your face again!

500
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,080
You aren't satisfied only with foreplay, are you?

501
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,070
You have to have this afterplay of melodrama!

502
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,690
She got mad because it was strawberry.

503
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,490
It isn't ice-cream that you'd get almond and pistachio flavours!

504
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,430
Does the uncle party, have matchsticks?

505
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,470
Go run to the canteen. It's time!

506
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,520
Uncle, give him a 100 bucks.

507
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,710
Give it.

508
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,260
Follow me!

509
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,490
I can't go beyond this point.

510
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,280
Deposit your mobiles, pendrives, hard-disks and any other storage devices.

511
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,280
There's a door ahead...

512
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,200
Knock it.

513
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,410
Twice!

514
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,710
And then wait.

515
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,370
Do you smoke?

516
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,230
No.

517
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,000
Kids!

518
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,420
Yes?

519
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,440
Tell chintu, that 'Yogi bhaiyaa' is here, to give him an internship.

520
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,890
Come in.

521
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,420
Sit.

522
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,370
He's in the middle of something...

523
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:52,200
Give him 75.

524
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,740
Minutes?

525
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,670
Headshots!

526
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,400
Despite being the class monitor, my performance from class 6 to class 12 steadily increased...

527
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,800
From 72.3% to 87.8%

528
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,510
This goes to show...

529
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,580
I'm responsible...

530
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,570
...persistent...

531
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,660
...dedicated, motivated, over...

532
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,220
Under-rated dude!

533
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,410
Responsible, persistent, motivated, dedicated, under...

534
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,410
Hi Shreya!

535
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,330
Hi Mandal!

536
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,050
Hi...

537
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,760
Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb your paranormal powerpoint fantasy.

538
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,340
I'll just sneak into Naveen's room and lock the door, so you can't come in!

539
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
No. No. No.

540
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,180
Actually, I was waiting for you!

541
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,420
Naveen'd told me that you're going to come.

542
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,770
In that blazer and towel?

543
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,650
You aren't a serial killer Mandal, are you?

544
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,450
Only, if looks could kill!

545
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,840
Please have a seat!

546
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,440
Actually, if I get tensed, I need to have a bath!

547
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,570
Better?

548
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,680
Congratulations Mandal.

549
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,250
You've reached a new level of creepy!

550
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,320
Soo...

551
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,060
Naveen's quit his job to...

552
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,190
Yeah, I know. He's told me everything.

553
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,410
And I too, want to...

554
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:02,440
Everything!

555
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,410
Everything!

556
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,920
Soo...

557
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:05,760
So?

558
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,130
Shreya. We're friends, aren't we?

559
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,170
Facebook-wise or in real life?

560
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,820
Joke!

561
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,500
Do you remember?

562
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,210
Last month, early morning...

563
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,220
You wanted a Xerox of your PAN card.

564
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,630
Naveen was sleeping.

565
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,760
So you asked me for help.

566
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,350
I was getting late for work...

567
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,550
I didn't have any change on me...

568
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,670
I still went and got the Xerox done.

569
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,320
Look, I've this one philosophy...

570
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,530
Friends should always help each other!

571
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,060
No. No. No. No. No.

572
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,350
One second.

573
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,620
You want me to convince Naveen to hire you?

574
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,070
No.

575
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,420
Sorry.

576
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:42,490
Not gonna happen.

577
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,740
Not gonna happen.

578
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,130
Anyway, I can't convince him. Instead, he'll end up convincing me!

579
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,160
Shreya... Trust me!

580
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,000
He can never convince you!

581
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,970
A man can never convince a woman, who gives him...

582
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,070
...Love!

583
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,370
And if...

584
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,160
He doesn't budge...

585
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,760
You know...

586
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,120
Use your methods!

587
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,400
What methods?

588
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,050
Intercourse

589
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,470
What?

590
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,060
Mandal, have you gone nuts?

591
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,600
Just for a 1 buck Xerox...

592
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,700
It's actually 2 bucks. One for each side!

593
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,310
I'm worth much more than that!

594
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,200
OK? I'm sorry.

595
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
I would've helped you with anything else, but with this, I can't! Sorry.

596
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,070
Naveen needs my help!

597
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,030
Yogi keeps winding him up against me!

598
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,100
I really want to be a part of this!

599
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,240
I know, I'm gonna regret this.

600
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,320
OK.

601
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,700
Alright.

602
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,210
Tell me one thing.

603
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,410
When do...

604
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,560
You call for a plumber?

605
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
That wasn't me...

606
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,030
Naveen thinks that I broke his jet spray and then...

607
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,550
No. I mean hypothetically.

608
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,290
I mean...

609
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,860
When would anyone, call for a plumber?

610
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:01,090
One calls for the plumber when a tap's broken.

611
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,690
Right. And what if a tap isn't broken?

612
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,280
Then why call the plumber?

613
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Exactly!

614
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:07,900
Look.

615
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,640
In this situation...

616
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,570
You're the plumber and Naveen's start-up doesn't have any broken tap.

617
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,950
Irrespective of, however great, the work you're doing in life is...

618
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,290
Unless, your inclusion doesn't solve any of their problems...

619
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,820
They don't need you!

620
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,710
See... You need to figure out what they need.

621
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,680
You also need a bigger towel, dude!

622
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,860
No. No.

623
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,910
Don't shy away!

624
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,610
I'm wearing my underwear!

625
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,690
Sorry.

626
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,040
Not wearing any!

627
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
F**K!

628
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,710
F**K!

629
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,590
Yogi!

630
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,690
And...

631
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,600
You must be Naveen.

632
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,120
How are you 'chintu'? I saw you at the threading ceremony, last.

633
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,150
Not 'chintu'.

634
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,110
Dungeon Master.

635
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,550
There's an underscore between Dungeon and Master.

636
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,900
So...

637
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,000
You guys want me to work for your company.

638
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,410
You tell him.

639
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,930
We were interested in discussing the possibilities...

640
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,000
I looked into your idea.

641
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,900
It's... quite interesting actually.

642
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,880
Looked into?

643
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,920
But, I haven't sent you any mail, as yet!

644
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,840
But you'd mailed NASSCOM, hadn't you?

645
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
You see...

646
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:33,590
Privacy on mail is a myth my friend!

647
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,420
So... If I join you guys...

648
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,000
How do I benefit?

649
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,210
What do I get?

650
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,390
Opportunity!

651
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,250
Of course, there'll also be a stipend initially.

652
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,410
About... 7K.

653
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,030
8... 8K. Yeah.

654
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,880
And as we grow, your monetory compensation will obviously increase...

655
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
Do you know what's the prize money for the Internation Counter Strike competition?

656
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,870
How much?

657
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,090
475,000...

658
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
Dollars.

659
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,140
4... 4 times 6 is 24...

660
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,430
And you won that?

661
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,550
Twice!

662
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,280
4... 4 times 2 is 8... 8 times 6 is 48...

663
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,940
So theoritically... I can hire you guys.

664
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,230
But not the other way round.

665
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,140
I want 30% equity...

666
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,050
And... veto on product design.

667
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,520
Dungeon_master@hotmail.com

668
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,060
Don't forget the underscore.

669
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,220
Mail me by Monday.

670
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,830
Or just save it in your drafts.

671
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,080
I'll read it.

672
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,500
I think we need Jeetu.

673
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,500
Do you think we need Jeetu?

674
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,920
We need Jeetu.

675
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,010
We'll have to first change the passwords for all our accounts.

676
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,160
What's up, start-up founder?

677
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
Your battery looks dead after listeninig to the deal.

678
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,060
What's up, entrepreneur uncle?

679
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
Pass on some stake to us as well!

680
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,510
Listen up Jeetu. There's no other way out. You have to join in.

681
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,890
I can't join in.

682
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,970
Sorry.

683
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,060
I told you!

684
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,010
You can never convince a woman who gives you sex!

685
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,050
Noo!

686
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,580
Suamya has agreed.

687
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
SO?

688
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,970
Ohh!

689
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,850
What?

690
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,910
Did you try talking to him?

691
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,120
That's all I've been able to do since I was 1.5 years old. TRY to talk!

692
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
With whom?

693
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,610
Haven't you watched 'Udaan'?

694
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,090
Ohhhh!

695
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360
Your dad?

696
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,640
He's alcoholic?

697
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,890
He's not alcoholic...

698
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,350
Why are you scared of your dad? Are you still a kid?

699
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,690
Naveen. Even my passbook is with him.

700
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,000
If my salary doesn't get credited on the 1st of the next month...

701
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,730
My life will get debited.

702
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,500
You guys, atleast, start.

703
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,830
I'll see. I'll try putting in a couple of hours of work, everyday after my job.

704
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,040
"You guys start", "I'll see". Are you mad?

705
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,280
This way, even the Beta version won't be ready in 6 months.

706
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,580
There's so much to do.

707
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,440
Excuse me!

708
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,520
Aren't you the guys launching the coolest company of Indian history?

709
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey! The start-up wags are here. -Hey!

710
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,220
The gold-diggers are here even before the money.

711
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,260
Listen, you need to get a better CEO, though!

712
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,540
Don't know about the coolest, but could be most short-lived for sure!

713
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,290
Don't say such bad things on a good day like this, Jeetu.

714
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,580
This is for you'll.

715
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,960
So what's up, Jeetu?

716
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,480
What are you doing here?

717
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,620
I've come here for the interview!

718
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,410
Mandal, that was only a joke. There's no interview happening.

719
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,390
I know. I know.

720
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
I know jokes.

721
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,860
I've taken improv. comedy classes for a month.

722
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,870
Is this taken? -Yes.

723
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,960
OK!

724
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,490
Don't you get it, motherf**ker?

725
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,460
Anyway our battery's down...

726
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,490
This is our shit, Madal!

727
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,650
We don't need you.

728
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Trust me.

729
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,990
You need me!

730
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,510
Infact without me...

731
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,590
You don't have a company!

732
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,920
OK, go get a chair.

733
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,030
We'll interview you right away!

734
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,920
Just hear him out na, once.

735
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,330
Tell me.

736
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,530
Why should we hire you?

737
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,020
You know, as an MBA...

738
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,410
I've always had a clarity about my R&Rs.

739
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:21,620
One of my KRA has been problem...

740
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,410
One of my KRA has been problem...

741
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:22,450
We don't need a marketing manager. We need a coder...

742
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,340
We don't need a marketing manager. We need a coder...

743
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,490
Thanks for applying. You interview's over.

744
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,520
No. No. No. One second.

745
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,790
I can solve your problem.

746
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,860
I can give you something, which you need.

747
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,360
I can give you Jeetu!

748
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,070
How?

749
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,220
Till the time, you'll don't get an investment...

750
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,080
I'll pay for Jeetu's salary.

751
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,900
A part of it through my salary and a part through my savings.

752
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:48,030
But I'll ensure that, Jeetu keeps getting as much as he gets from his company.

753
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,130
Mandal. Why would you do these things for us?

754
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,230
Not for you guys...

755
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,560
I'll do it for myself!

756
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,130
You guys are the best friends I've ever had.

757
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,550
I know, apart from Naveen...

758
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,650
We've not interacted as much...

759
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,260
But I've always thought, that the four of us are a very good team.

760
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,520
You know when I'd seen 'Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara'

761
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,060
I'd decided that...

762
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,180
The four of us too, just like them...

763
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,430
Would go on a trip.

764
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,840
But ZNMD had only 3 guys.

765
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,790
OK. Then... like 'Dil Chahta Hai'.

766
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,350
Again, only 3 guys, Mandal.

767
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,230
'Rock On' definitely had 4 guys.

768
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,860
The 4th one, gets cancer and dies. Only 3 remain.

769
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:36,540
The point is, if I join your start-up...

770
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,970
Then Jeetu can work full-time with us.

771
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:45,790
All MBAs... are not that bad.

772
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,990
Soo...

773
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,470
Is somebody going to say something, or are we sitting just like this for the next hour?

774
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Don't worry, guys.

775
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,170
It won't be that bad.

776
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,740
Backstreet Boys... Alright!

777
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
Cheers!

778
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,510
And then there were four!

779
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,820
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

780
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,190
Finally, he's made himself useful!

781
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,570
So, Jeetu's back!

782
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,960
Important point - This news doesn't get out of here!

783
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,230
If dad gets to know... - Stop going "Dad. Dad."

784
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,440
Once we're a million dollar company, even your dad will chill out!

785
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,580
And also, I've done some research and thought of a few names for our compnay.

786
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,930
I think, our compnay name should have 'le' in it!

787
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Like Google had 'gle', Apple has 'ple', Oracle has 'cle'

788
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,980
What non-sense are you talking? You've started with your stupid marketing logics again!

789
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,000
Please don't throw fries on me. I'm the marketing manager!

790
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,910
Oops! Sorry.

791
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,340
Careful! Why are you throwing it on me?

792
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,970
So, this is your million dollar team?

793
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,550
Congrats
