00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
Come over here.
过来

Gerome painted this in 1872.

What are those people doing?

That's what the painting is called. "Pollice Verso".

It means "thumbs down".

And who is it for?
那是给谁画的？

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,040
For the gladiator.
给角斗士

Why? So he can kill this man.
为什么？所以他可以杀了这个人

140
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,100
Actually, it is not clear which one means "death" in ancient Rome.

141
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,680
This, or this.
这个或这个

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,280
But Gerome thought this was the fitting one.

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
If you do this, the gladiator will kill.
如果这样做，角斗士就会杀人

144
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,720
And there would be death in the Arena.

145
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,720
If you do this you save the man's life.
如果这样，你可以挽救人的性命

146
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,760
But one is not enough. The decision has to be unanimous.
但是一个人这样做还不够  决定必须是一致的

147
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,200
What I mean is, who will die or live has to be decided unanimously.
我的意思是，生或死必须共同决定

148
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,240
Unanimous decisions are always deemed legitimate.
