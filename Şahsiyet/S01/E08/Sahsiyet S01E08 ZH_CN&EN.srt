It didn't sit right with me...

那是一间很小的房子  我不知道为什么他们无法逃脱

725
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,600
Then two young men came to talk to me. They were brothers. Twins, apparently.
然后有两个年轻人来跟我说话  他们显然是孪生兄弟

- One was named Seyfi or something. - And the other's name, Umut?
-一个叫塞菲还是什么  -另一个叫乌穆特？

727
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,240
That might've been it. It's been a while.

They're actually triplets. Go on with your story.

They told me to drop the subject and go home.

His time must've come, they said.

If you keep hanging around, they might decide

to take her revenge on you, they said.

他们原话说的是“他们会塞满你的洞”

But he'd been singing the same refrain for years,

He told me about a girl then.

He didn't answer any of it. Just up and left.

我以为他又在幻想  他从来没有去过那里

But there was nothing we could do.

But drink? Drink turns people inside out.
