1
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
土耳其共和国法律
LAWS OF REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

2
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
可怜的阿加
Poor Agah.

3
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
穆尼尔?
Munir?

4
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
穆尼尔?
Munir?

5
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
你在哪里？
Where are you, my boy?

6
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,120
穆尼尔?
Munir?

7
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
穆尼尔?
Munir?

8
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
穆尼尔?
Munir?

9
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
快出来，该吃早餐了
Come on boy, it's time for breakfast.

10
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
你在哪里？
Where are you?

11
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
穆尼尔?
Munir!

12
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
你在哪？
Where are you, sir?

13
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
穆尼尔?
Munir?

14
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,080
您去度假了吗？
Have you gone to a vacation or something?

15
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
没有
No.

16
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
穆尼尔从来没有独自在家待过吗？
So Munir has never been alone?

17
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,150
没有
No.

18
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
您从来没有忘记给它喂食吗？
You haven't delayed his treatment?

19
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,160
没有，我给它的食物是您给我用于治疗它的......
No, I was giving him the cat food that you gave me for his...

20
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,560
急性肾功能衰竭
Acute kidney failure.

21
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,050
是的
Yes.

22
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
他是因此而死吗？
Did he die because of that?

23
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,880
因为急性肾衰竭
Because of acute kidney failure.

24
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
不仅如此，它已经脱水了
Not just that. The cat has also been dehydrated.

25
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
什么？
How?

26
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
穆尼尔 - 我可爱的猫
MUNIR - MY LOVELY CAT

27
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
兄弟，我们该拿她怎么办？
Man, what are we going to do with her?

28
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,820
她来这里已经六个月了
She's been here for six months.

29
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,560
但人们仍然在谈论内芙拉
and they are still talking about Nevra.

30
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
你是因为睡不到她才觉得难受吧
You are bothered because you couldn't sleep with her.

31
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
滚蛋，你他妈在说什么？
Fuck off. What the fuck are you talking about?

32
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,070
我有很多同学想来这里都想疯了
How many of my classmates is crazy about coming here

33
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,070
你知道吗？
do you know?

34
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
她简直就是凭空出现的
She literally came here out of nowhere.

35
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,600
你知道为什么吗？因为她是女人
Do you know why? Because she is a woman.

36
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
他们称之为积极性区别对待
They called it positive discrimination.

37
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,350
哪里有积极的一面？
What part of this is positive?

38
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,950
外面有好多猛男呢
There are many strong men out there.

39
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
但对他们来说，有必要将内芙拉放在首位
But for them it's necessary to put Nevra into the spotlight.

40
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
内芙拉 内芙拉
Nevra, Nevra.

41
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,200
去他妈的“人力资源部”
Fuck that thing called 'human resources'.

42
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,050
这和这有什么关系？
What does it have to do with that?

43
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,050
假设您和内芙拉在一起执勤
Let's say you're out there with Nevra.

44
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,480
你会信任内芙拉吗？你会信任她吗？
Would you trust Nevra? Could you trust her?

45
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
如果是个拿枪的男人，我会相信的
I would trust more if it was a man holding the gun.

46
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,120
至少很清楚他会做什么
At least it would be clear what he'd do.

47
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,220
是啊
See

48
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
她应该滚出这个地方了
She can get the fuck out of here.

49
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
但是绝不能让她轻易离开
But she shouldn't go without a fuck.

50
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,120
必须的
Definitely.

51
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
奴尔滕，你能安排下星期的预约吗？
Nurten, could you schedule an appointment for next week, please?

52
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
阿加 贝尤鲁
Agah Beyoglu.

53
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
谢谢
Thanks.

54
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
好了
Now...

55
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,520
首先我们应该通知您的家人
First thing we should do is to inform your family.

56
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
他们必须先知道这件事
They have to know about this first.

57
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
你老婆已经去世了
Your wife had passed away.

58
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
是的
Yes.

59
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
已经十年了
It's been 10 years.

60
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
你有一个女儿
You have a daughter.

61
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
是的，但是她不在这里，她住在国外
Yes, but she's not here, she's living abroad.

62
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,480
没关系，你应该通知她
Doesn't matter, you should inform her.

63
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,840
她可以打电话给我，我想和她聊一下
She may even call me, I would like to talk to her.

64
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
明白了吗？
Are we clear?

65
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
明白
Yes.

66
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
祝你好胃口
Bon appetit.

67
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
我在想是否应该重做检测，以防结果不准确
I was thinking if we should redo the test, in case the results are wrong.

68
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
我认识一个叫内奇米的人
I knew a guy named Necmi.

69
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
-他们说他得了癌症，但是后来......-我知道
- They said he had cancer but then... - I know.

70
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
我知道
I know.

71
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
很难接受
It's hard to accept.

72
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
但是结果很清楚
But the results are clear.

73
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
症状也是如此
So are the symptoms.

74
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
诊断毫无疑问，阿加
For me, there is no doubt in this diagnosis, Agah.

75
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,240
你有早期的老年痴呆症
You have early stage Alzheimer's.

76
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
爸爸
Yes, Dad?

77
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
宝贝
Honey.

78
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
爸爸，我做不下去了，我已经忍无可忍了
Dad, I can't do it. I can't bear this anymore.

79
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
怎么了？我打电话给总检察长
What happened? I'll call the Chief Inspector

80
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,680
爸爸，我不是孩子了，我不需要你打电话给任何人
Dad, I'm not a kid. I don't want you to call anyone.

81
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
那你为什么给我打电话
Then why did you call me?

82
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
闺女？
Daughter?

83
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
闺......
Dau...

84
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
但是医生，我记得所有事情
But doctor, I remember everything.

85
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,080
人们患老年痴呆症时会忘记事情
People forget things when they have Alzheimer's.

86
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,600
我在法院工作了27年
I worked at the courthouse for 27 years.

87
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
如果我现在过去，我还记得所有文件的位置
If I went there now I'd remember where every file is.

88
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,360
你还处于初期
You are in the early stages.

89
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,080
随便问我生日，朋友的电话号码等等……
Ask me then, anything. My anniversary, friends' phone numbers...

90
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
这些我都记得很熟
I know them by heart.

91
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,240
我的朋友曾经说我就像电话簿
My friends used to call me I was like a phone book.

92
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,480
当年我们无法保存电话号码，所以我就记在脑子里
Back then we couldn't save the numbers so I memorized them.

93
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
阿加
Agah.

94
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
你忘记给猫喝水了
You forgot to give water to your cat.

95
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
你忘了给它喂食
You forgot to feed him.

96
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
它饿死了
He starved to death.

97
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
我怎么会这样？怎么回事？
How could I do that? How?

98
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
可怜的穆尼尔
Poor Munir.

99
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,000
听好，这是早期诊断
Look, this is an early diagnosis.

100
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,120
对治疗有极大的帮助
This will be of tremendous help for the treatment.

101
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,440
我们有一些患者在确诊后已经生活了20年
We have patients that lived 20 years after the diagnosis.

102
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
所以请放心
So rest assured.

103
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
活了20年，但他们还记得自己的生活吗？
Lived 20 years but do they remember what they lived?

104
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,680
老年痴呆症直接影响记忆
Alzheimer's directly affects memory.

105
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,520
这是痴呆症的主要原因之一
It's one of the main reasons for dementia.

106
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,240
但是，我们将竭尽所能保持您的头脑活跃
But we will do all we can to stall this and to keep your mind alive.

107
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
但是迟早我会忘记的，对吗？
But sooner or later, I will forget things, right?

108
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
现在先不要考虑这些
Don't think about this now.

109
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
我所有的记忆，经历都将被抹去
All my memories, experiences will be erased, they will go away.

110
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
然后我会怎样？
What will happen to me?

111
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
我是说……
I mean...

112
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
电话号码没有多重要
Phone numbers aren't that important.

113
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
但是我的人格将会怎样？
But what will happen to my personality?

114
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
也会被抹掉吗？
Wouldn't it be erased too?

115
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
我会忘记我是什么样的人
I will forget what kind of man I am.

116
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,640
你还活着，但你并不存在
You are alive but you don't exist.

117
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
怎么会有人忍受得了呢？
How can someone endure this?

118
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
您可以把它放在口袋里
You may put this in your pocket.

119
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,760
我来检查一下声音，请说点什么
I'll check the sound, say something, please.

120
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
我应该说什么？
What should I say? Hi.

121
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
您可以数一下星期几
You can count the days of the week.

122
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
星期五，星期六，星期天
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

123
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
星期一
Monday.

124
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
星期二，星期三
Tuesday, Wednesday.

125
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
星期四，星期五
Thursday, Friday.

126
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
可以了
That should do.

127
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
让我们开始吧
Let's get started.

128
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
我从一个基本问题开始
I'll start with a basic question.

129
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
在拥有140名员工的凶杀科中
How does it feel to be the only woman

130
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
作为唯一的女性，您感觉如何？
working in an homicide bureau with 140 staff members?

131
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
感觉怎么样？
How does it feel?

132
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,160
当然很棒
Of course it's amazing.

133
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,280
我感到非常荣幸
I feel very privileged.

134
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,120
首先，我们所有人都是凶杀科的成员
First of all, all of us here are part of the homicide bureau.

135
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,840
这里几乎没有任何性别歧视
It's impossible to see anything like gender discrimination

136
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,560
或其他任何歧视的行为
or any other sexist approaches in this institution.

137
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
没有任何问题，我的朋友们都很支持我
Instead of any problems, my friends are supporting me so much.

138
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
对我来说也是一种责任
Which also means another responsibility for me.

139
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,600
我正在尽我所能来得到他们的支持
I am trying to do my best to be worthy of their support.

140
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,580
您的专业是公共管理，对吗？
You studied public administration, right?

141
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,280
是
Yes.

142
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,200
您还在私营企业做过经理
You even worked as a manager in private sector

143
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
但后来您决定报名参加警察学院
but then you decided to enroll at the police academy.

144
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
是
Yes.

145
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,880
您为什么决定当警察？
Why did you decide to become a police officer?

146
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
我一直都想做，因为……
I always thought about it because...

147
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,920
我的父亲是一名警察，他是我生命中最伟大的人
The greatest man I know was a policeman... My father.

148
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,640
现在退休了
Who is currently retired.

149
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,840
随着成长，我开始理解一些事情
You start to understand things as you grow.

150
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,520
我们几乎看不到我们父亲
We barely saw our father.

151
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,960
也许周末可以，但只有一天
Maybe at the weekends, just for a day.

152
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
我曾经很讨厌他
I used to resent him.

153
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,160
我曾经说他更关心别人
I used to tell him that he cares about other people more.

154
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
看来我父亲的工作就是关心别人
It seems that my father's job is to care about other people.

155
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,040
他把这个概念深深地印在我的脑海里
And he ingrained this concept in me so much

156
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
以至于我不知道如何以其他方式生活
that I don't know how to live any other way.

157
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,680
我在每次访谈时都会重复这句话
I actually repeat this in every interview

158
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
但是当警察对我来说从来就不是一份工作
but being a police officer is not a job for me, never has been.

159
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
有一个概念叫做善良
There is a concept called goodness.

160
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,000
对我来说，成为一名警察意味着成为善良的一部分
For me, being a police officer means being a part of that goodness.

161
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
那就是我的目标
That's my purpose...

162
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
做一个好人
To become a good person...

163
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
德瓦!
Deva!

164
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,240
德瓦，回答我！昨晚你在哪里过夜？
Deva, answer me! Where were you last night?

165
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
德瓦，回答我！
Deva, answer me!

166
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
喂？
Yes?

167
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,470
祖哈尔，你好亲爱的
Zuhal, hello my dear.

168
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560
等一下
Wait a minute.

169
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
告诉我昨晚你在哪里
Tell me where were you last night.

170
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,400
看着我！
Look at me!

171
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,080
你要去哪里？
Where are you going?

172
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
那你跟我来啊
Come with me then.

173
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
你不可以出去！
You're not going!

174
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
德瓦，我要揍死你!
Deva, I'll fuck you up!

175
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
德瓦!
Deva!

176
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
喂？
Yes?

177
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
亲爱的，这个时间不方便吗？我吵醒你了吗？现在几点了？
My dear, is this a bad time? Did I wake you up? What time is it there?

178
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,840
不，我们都醒着，这边是早上，出什么事情了？
No, we are awake. It's morning here. Is something wrong?

179
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
我给我的女儿打电话还需要理由吗？
Do I need a reason to call my daughter?

180
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
我都不记得你上一次来电话是什么时候了
I don't remember the last time you called.

181
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
一直都是我给你打电话
I'm the one who always calls.

182
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
德瓦怎么样？
How is Deva?

183
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,470
德瓦快把我逼疯了
Deva is making me crazy!

184
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,240
德瓦不听我的话，我们甚至不能沟通……
Deva doesn't listen to me, we can't even talk...

185
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,800
爸爸，你吃了我寄给你的维生素吗？
Dad, did you take the vitamins I sent you?

186
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
吃了，谢谢
I did, thank you.

187
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,120
但是不可以吃太多，可能会导致糖尿病
But don't take them in high doses, they may cause diabetes.

188
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
每天吃一片
You take one.

189
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
持续服用三个月
And keep taking for three months...

190
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,760
服用三个月，然后停用一个月
Take them for three months then stop taking for a month.

191
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
然后你再服用三个月，别忘了
Then you take them for another three months. Don't ignore it.

192
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
你也不听话
You didn't listen either.

193
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
什么？
What?

194
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,240
你小时候也不听我们的
You didn't listen to us when you were young either.

195
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
是吗？
Is that so?

196
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
你怎么知道的？
How would you know?

197
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,280
你怎么知道的？德瓦今年16岁
How would you know? Deva is 16 years old.

198
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,040
我16岁那年是我在寄宿学校的第5年
When I was 16, it was my fifth year on boarding school.

199
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
还记得你把我送走了吗？
Remember that you sent me away?

200
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
你和我在一起吗？
Were you with me?

201
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
妈妈和我在一起吗？
Was my mother there?

202
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,840
你怎么知道我听话不听话？
How would you know if I had listened someone or not?

203
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
你知道我在做什么吗？
Did you know what I was doing?

204
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
你知道我现在在做什么吗？
Do you know what I'm doing right now? No!

205
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,800
我能怎么办，亲爱的，你逃到了世界的另一端，去了澳大利亚
What can I do, my dear. You ran away to the other side of the world, to Australia.

206
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
爸，我要离婚了
Dad, I'm getting a divorce.

207
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
你有什么想说的吗？
Do you have any idea about this?

208
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,880
爸，对不起
Dad, I'm sorry.

209
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,440
我不是故意的，我很难过
I didn't mean to. I am very upset.

210
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
对不起，请原谅我
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

211
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,800
你刚才要说什么？刚才……
Were you going to say something? Were you...

212
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,200
我们来为内芙拉干杯
I propose a toast for Nevra.

213
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
每周都有不同的采访
Different interviews, every week.

214
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
我们之中总算出了个名人
Finally, one of us is famous.

215
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
别傻了，我可不是什么名人
Don't be silly, I'm not famous.

216
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,850
等等，这是什么？
Oh, wait, what was it?

217
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
敬内芙拉……
To Nevra...

218
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
让朋友安心，让敌人敬畏
Who reassures friends and awes foes.

219
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
敬内芙拉宝宝！
To Nevra the po-po!

220
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,280
-你说啥？-她说宝宝
- What do you mean by po-po? - She said po-po.

221
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
总是在电影里看到，我一直想说
They say that in the movies all the time. I've always wanted to say po-po.

222
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,040
很好，你们说完了吗，我可以现在喝吗？
Nice, are you finished? May I drink now?

223
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
撇开玩笑不提，内芙拉，你为什么去当警察？
All jokes aside, Nevra, why did you become a police officer?

224
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,600
什么意思？
What do you mean 'why'?

225
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
这是一个简单的问题
It's a simple question.

226
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
你为什么要成为法西斯主义者？
Why did you become a fascist?

227
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
你在说什么？犯什么傻？
What are you saying? Are you a troll?

228
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
喝醉了吗？
Are you drunk?

229
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
等一下，我很好奇
Hang on, I am curious.

230
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,680
我们很少聚在一起，你别这样说话
We meet very rarely and you say these things.

231
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
你其实是在问我
You are actually asking me this...

232
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
为什么我没有进入保险公司？
Why didn't I get into an insurance company?

233
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
为什么我没有去财政部？
Why I am not in the ministry of finance?

234
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
为什么我没有做银行家？
Why I am not a banker?

235
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,680
为什么我不像大学里的革命主义者那样嫁给有钱人
Why I didn't act like a revolutionist in college and then marry a rich guy

236
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
像你一样没事做混日子？
and sit on my ass all day without working, like you?

237
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
这是我的答案
Here is my answer...

238
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
我不想这样
I didn't want to.

239
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
我想……
I wanted to do...

240
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
我想做些事
I wanted to do something...

241
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
有意义的事
Something real.

242
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,320
做什么？
What is that?

243
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
这是一个简单的问题
It's a simple question.

244
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,880
你为什么成为法西斯主义者？
Why did you become a fascist?

245
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
我只是在开玩笑
I'm just kidding.

246
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
她生气了
She's offended.

247
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
她上学时也是这样
She was like that in college too.

248
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
来吧
Come on.

249
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
敬这么多年后的重聚
To reuniting after all these years.

250
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
敬这个美丽的夜晚
To this beautiful night.

251
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
蒙塔兹!
Mumtaz!

252
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,800
阿加，我在这里
Agah, I'm here...

253
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,960
-这边，阿加-借过
- Come, Agah. Come here. - Excuse me.

254
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
这就是为什么我愿意不来这里
That's why I don't come here.

255
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,240
人群，醉汉，喧闹声……
The crowd, the drunks, the noise...

256
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
我公寓里的流浪汉就够多了
Bums in my apartment are enough for me

257
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
你还带我来这里
and you brought me here.

258
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
你已经习惯了
You are used to this Agah.

259
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
没有，我还是不习惯
I'm not. I couldn't get used to them.

260
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
你在这里住了多久了？
How long have you lived here?

261
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,160
如果你不想住在这里，就卖掉您的公寓
If you don't want to live here, sell your apartments

262
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
离开这里
and move away.

263
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
我才不走！
I won't go!

264
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
我是姓贝尤鲁的，要走也是他们走
My last name is Beyoglu, they'll go.

265
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,320
-你会的-我不会
- You will. - I won't.

266
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
-你会走的！-我才不走
- You will brother! - I won't go away.

267
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
绝不
I won't.

268
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,400
很久没见到你了，阿加
It's been so long since I saw you, Agah.

269
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,760
如果我没有给你打电话，我们可能永远都不会见面
If I hadn't called you, we were never going to meet.

270
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
怎么了，你的生活中是否有你爱的人？
What's wrong man? Is there someone in your life?

271
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,240
你在和谁约会吗？还是在忽略我们？
Are you dating someone? Are you ignoring us?

272
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
我没有忽略，我只是没有时间
I'm not ignoring, I just don't have time.

273
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,880
滚蛋，我们都这把年纪，只剩下时间了
Fuck off. In our age, time is all we have.

274
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
你真是可笑
You are a joke.

275
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
别这么内向
Don't become introverted.

276
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,320
我早上可以带你去博斯普鲁斯海峡
I can come and take you to Bosphorus in mornings.

277
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
过来
Come here.

278
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
-怎么了，先生 -尝尝这个
- Yes, sir. - Taste this.

279
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
-味道不好吗 -尝一尝
- Does it taste bad? - Just taste it.

280
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,200
我可以告诉厨师为您重做一份
I can tell the cook to prepare another for you.

281
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
为什么？
Why?

282
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,440
您不喜欢
You didn't like it.

283
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,760
我没要你另外准备，我是说让你尝一尝
I didn't say that. I said 'taste this'.

284
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
你为什么要找他麻烦？
Why are you bothering him?

285
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
他另外准备新的给你
He's offering a new one.

286
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,520
那不是重点，人们不互相倾听
That's not the point. People don't listen to each other.

287
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
也许味道不错，我不明白
Maybe it tastes good and I don't get it.

288
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
回去上班吧，去吧
Just go back to work. Come on.

289
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
-走吧 -不用
- Go. - No!

290
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
你真让我吃惊
You surprised me.

291
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,480
我们平静，温柔的阿加
Our peaceful, sweet Agah

292
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
骂了服务员，我真不敢相信
scolding the waiter. I can't believe it.

293
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
那不是重点
That's not the point.

294
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
人们都不能认真的倾听对方
People don't listen to each other properly.

295
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,520
自动应答，无需等待
Automatic answers without waiting.

296
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
现在一切都自动化了，他们竟然说我们无法相处
Everything is automated now, and they say we can't get along.

297
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,520
别生气了
Don't get mad, okay.

298
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
我们吃完就走吧，我们去别的地方
Let's eat and go, we'll go somewhere else.

299
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,840
我不该来，太晚了
I shouldn't come, it's late.

300
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
那是自动答案，一点都不晚，现在是晚上8:30
That's the automatic answer. It's not late, it's 8:30 pm.

301
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
穆阿兹还想见你呢
Muazzez also asked to see you.

302
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,960
她叫我带你过去
She told me to bring you with me.

303
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,920
我们的朋友组织了一个活动，我们应该……
Our friends organized an event that we should...

304
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,560
什么活动？
Where did that event come out from?

305
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
看在上帝的份上！我们一起去
For god's sake! We're going.

306
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,840
就这样，我的前列腺毁了我
That's it. My prostate destroyed me.

307
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,920
毁了我，使我痛苦
Destroyed me, made me miserable.

308
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,280
带我来这里干嘛？
What am I doing here?

309
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,200
等等，我给你介绍一个人
Just hang on, I'll introduce you to someone.

310
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
这就是你把我带到这里的原因？
So is that why you brought me here?

311
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
这是个什么陷阱吗？
Did you set a trap for me?

312
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,280
那是努赫特，这是我曾跟你提过的朋友，阿加
That's Nukhet. And this is my friend I told you about, Agah.

313
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
努赫特
Nukhet.

314
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
你好，很高兴见到你
Hi, nice to meet you.

315
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
你好
Hello.

316
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
努赫特一直在上探戈课
Nukhet has been taking tango lessons

317
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
我告诉她你是一位探戈大师
and I told her that there is a tango master here.

318
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,080
得了吧
Come on...

319
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
您不会介意指点努赫特跳舞吧？
You wouldn't mind teaching Nukhet a thing or two, right?

320
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,880
这是我的荣幸
It would be my pleasure.

321
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,680
所以他们跳得很好，不是吗？
So... They're doing a great job, aren't they?

322
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
是的，但是跟我们有什么关系吗？
Yeah but, what's with us?

323
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,800
你又懵了，为什么不去喝点什么呢？
You are confused again, why don't you drink something?

324
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
不，我不想像他们一样
No, I don't want to. I don't want to be like them.

325
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,800
他们很快就会喝醉了
They will be drunk soon.

326
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,080
他们会让自己难堪
They will embarrass themselves.

327
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,760
当他们醒来时会后悔的
And they will regret everything when they wake up.

328
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,040
他们为什么会后悔？
Why would they regret?

329
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,520
他们喝醉了
They'll just get drunk.

330
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
不会记住任何事情
They won't remember anything in the morning.

331
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
真好
How nice.

332
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
既然我会忘记
Since I won't remember

333
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
我就可以做任何我想做的事，是吗？
I can do anything I want, is that so?

334
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
正是
Exactly.

335
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
真好啊
How nice.

336
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
我会统统忘掉，所以我可以做任何事情
I won't remember, so I can do anything.

337
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
但是早上还是会醒来的，不是吗？
Won't they wake up in the morning?

338
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
你又在纠结这个了，阿加
You're obsessed with this again, Agah.

有趣的句子
Interesting sentence.

342
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,840
那是良心
That's conscience.

343
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
从字面上看，它可以吞噬您的心
It can eat your heart out, literally.

344
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
永远忘记
Forgetting forever.

345
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,560
忘记你正在忘记
Forgetting that you are forgetting.

346
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
对，就是这样
Yes, that's it.

347
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
我会忘记一切
I will forget everything.

348
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,680
我会统统忘掉
I won't remember anything.

349
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
敬阿加
To Agah.

350
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
我不会忘记
I'm not forgetting.

351
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
再来一杯
One more please.

352
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
阿加!
Agah!

353
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
你要走了吗？
Are you leaving?

354
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
我有点急事
I had an emergency.

355
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
你随时可以打电话给我

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,080
好吧，让我们谈谈心理活动
Okay, let's talk about mental activities.

420
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,960
我们应该激活那些从未起作用的大脑神经元
We should activate your brain neurons that have never worked until now.

421
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,000
要怎么做？
How will we do that?

422
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
例如
For example...

423
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,880
我的一位患者熟悉拉丁语言
One of my patients was familiar with Latin languages.

424
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,160
后来开始学习日语
And she started learning Japanese.

425
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,040
并从中受益匪浅
And she benefited a lot from it.

426
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,040
你要我学日语吗？
You want me to learn Japanese?

427
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,000
不是的
No.

428
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
每个人都有不同的兴趣
Everyone has a different interest.

429
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,960
一定有您一直想做但做不到的事情
There must be something that you always wanted to do but you couldn't.

430
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
我有很多想做的事
There are many things I want to do.

431
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,520
就是这样，很好
That's it, very good.

432
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,400
不管是什么事，要如何做
Look, whatever it is, however it is done...

433
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
开始做计划吧
You will start doing it with utmost planning.

434
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,160
计划就是关键词
Look, planning is the key word here.

435
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
您应该有每日，每周，每月的计划
You should have daily, weekly, monthly plans.

436
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,200
并且应该检查是否按照计划执行
You should check if you are following those plans accordingly.

437
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,320
不要走任何捷径
You won't cut corners.

438
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,040
让这件事变得复杂
You'll make it complicated.

439
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
做好细节
You'll detail it.

440
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,520
假设您要给植物浇水
Let's assume that you'll water a plant.

441
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,320
要把植物的每一片叶子都喷水
You'll spray every leaf of that plant

442
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,920
一片接一片，耐心地做
one by one, patiently.

443
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
你会很享受你正在做的事情
You should enjoy what you're doing.

444
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,240
阿加，这样你会做到完美
Agah, you'll do that in such an impeccable way

445
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,400
这颗植物根本无法判断是在下雨还是在浇水
that the plant won't be able to tell if it's raining or you're watering it.

446
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,880
明白吗？
Are we clear?

447
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
-我很清楚 -很好
- We are clear. - Nice.

448
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,840
非常好
Very nice.

449
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,040
好，跟我说说
Okay, now tell me...

450
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,360
您最近感觉如何？
How have you been feeling lately?

451
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,440
从来没有这么好过
I've never felt so good.

452
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
安全检查
SECURITY CLEARANCE

453
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,560
身份证副本
IDENTIFICATION CARD COPY

454
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,240
谁啊？
Damn it.

455
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,680
-什么事？-你是修理工，所以你应该知道
- What? - You are a mechanic, so you should know.

456
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
为什么修理工总是迟到？
Why are mechanics always late?

457
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,160
什么？
What?

458
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,160
例如我们的电梯修理工，我们等了很久，但他没来
Our elevator mechanic for instance, we waited for so long but he didn't come.

459
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,160
过了很久他才来，但是他来得很晚
Then he came, but he was late.

460
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,480
你是谁，你在说什么？
Who are you, what are you saying?

461
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,600
我们要一辈子等修理工吗？
Are we going to wait for mechanics our whole lives?

462
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
-走开，这么晚了你到底要干嘛？-不，我要说的是
- Go away, it's so late... - No, I was going to say that...

463
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,240
你……你进来干什么？
You... Hey, what are you doing? Why are you going in?

464
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,480
很快就好
Just a sec...

465
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
把这些录入系统
You are going to write these down on computer.

466
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,120
也祝你早上好
Good morning to you too.

467
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,120
内政部
TO THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AFFAIRS

468
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
进来吧！
Come in!

469
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
这是什么？
What's this?

470
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,880
长官，这是我的辞职报告
My resignation, sir.

471
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,440
我不明白
Really, I didn't get it...

472
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,400
我知道是辞职信，我问你为什么
I can see that. I am asking why.

473
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,640
我必须辞职
I have to do that...

474
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,360
因为个人原因，请您批准
It's because of personal reasons. You'll put it in process.

475
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,120
我还没喝咖啡，还不清醒
I haven't had my coffee yet. I'm not awake yet.

476
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,680
你知道我会做什么吗？
Do you know what I'll do?

477
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,120
我把你的辞职报告
I'll take your resignation

478
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
放在我的抽屉里
and put it in my drawer.

479
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,960
给你五天假期
And I'll give you five days off.

480
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,600
回家休息一下，好好思考
Go home, get some rest, think this through

481
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,520
如果五天后你仍然想辞职，我会接受的
and if you still want to resign after five days, I'll accept it.

482
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,960
到时候我会批准，好吗？
I'll put your paper in process. Okay?

483
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,680
-但是，长官 -内芙拉！
- But, Chief... - Nevra!

484
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,040
你知道是我想让你进警察局的吗
Did you know that it was me who wanted you here at the bureau?

485
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,080
我从五十个女孩中选了你
I chose you from 50 girls.

486
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,680
不是因为你父亲是警察
It wasn't because your father was a cop.

487
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,360
你知道为什么吗？
Do you know why?

488
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
因为在那50个人中，虽然你的工作前景光明
Because among those 50, it was only you determined to be

489
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,720
但只有你有决心做警察
a cop although you had a bright future in your job.

490
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
我告诉自己她疯了，而我恰好需要一个疯子在这里
I told myself that she was crazy and I needed someone crazy here.

491
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,840
回家好好想一想
Go home and think.

492
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
你好？
Yes?

493
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,760
声音小一点！
Turn it down!

494
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
她快把我逼疯了
She's driving me crazy.

495
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
她已经疯了，现在要让我疯了
She got crazy now she's making me crazy.

496
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
有什么事吗？
How can I help you?

497
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,240
我是阿加，阿加 贝尤鲁，来自法院
I'm Agah, Agah Beyoglu, from the courthouse.

498
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,760
-您是秘书处的 -是的
- From the secretary. - Yes.

499
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
已经好几年了……
It has been years...

500
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,200
我就觉得你看着很眼熟
I was thinking that you somehow look familiar.

501
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,040
我永远不会忘记我看到的每一张脸
I never forget a face that I saw.

502
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
-欢迎 -谢谢
- Welcome. - Thank you.

503
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
-进来 -谢谢
- Come, come in. - Thank you.

504
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
我们正在吃晚餐
We were just having dinner.

505
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
-饿了吗？我可以准备…… -不，谢谢
- Are you hungry? I can prepare for... - No, thank you.

506
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,680
对不起，有点乱
I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.

507
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,240
以前有一个女孩负责打扫房子，但是她把人家吓跑了
There was a girl cleaning the house but she ran away because of her.

508
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
每个人都被吓跑了
Everyone runs away.

509
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,040
谁能忍受这个？
Who would tolerate this?

510
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,480
你为什么不脱掉外套呢？
Why don't you take your coat off?

511
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,120
不用了，我感冒了
No thanks, I caught a cold.

512
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
-祝你快点好起来-谢谢
- Get well soon. - Thanks.

513
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,120
已经20年了，对吧？
It's been 20 years, right?

514
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,120
大概吧
I guess so.

515
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
你还记得阿加吗？
Do you remember Agah?

516
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,080
当我做档案工作的时候
When I was working on archives.

517
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,440
巡回法庭的塞拉尔推荐阿加，上帝保佑他
Celal from assize court recommended Agah, God bless him.

518
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,600
-他也过世了 -愿他安息
- He died too... - Really, may he rest in peace.

519
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,800
他每个周末去那里
He went there every weekend.

520
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,160
-是坎布拉吗？-是的，是坎布拉
- Was it Kambura? - Yes, it was Kambura.

521
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,920
阿加在坎布拉法院秘书处工作
Agah was working at the secretariat at Kambura Courthouse.

522
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,040
您帮我查了很多文件，对吗？
You opened many files for me right?

523
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,440
我们曾经一起去过那里
We went there with you once.

524
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
我们在河边吃鳟鱼，记得吗？
We ate trout near the river, remember?

525
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,400
-她已经这样四年了-她怎么了？
- She's been like this for four years. - What's wrong with her?

526
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,920
不好，阿加，很不好
It's bad, Agah, bad.

527
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,600
她得了老年痴呆症
She has Alzheimer's.

528
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,520
祝她快点好起来……
Get well soon.

529
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,920
她好不起来了
She won't get well.

530
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,840
看看她，她以前不是这样的
Look at her. She wasn't someone to be like this.

531
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,000
病魔已经毁了她
She's ruined.

532
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
她也毁了我们
She ruined us too.

533
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,000
我们的女儿住在马德里
Our daughter is living in Madrid.

534
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,400
我们去拜访她
We went to visit her.

535
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,400
我们在那里看了弗拉门戈表演
We watched a flamenco show there.

536
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,600
所有这些东西都是在那买的
All these things are from there.

537
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,120
怎么说呢……
How do they say...

538
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,160
费扎与生活的唯一联系就是这些
Feza's only connection to life is these.

539
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,800
我不知道为什么，她的记忆只保留了这些
I don't know why, her memory only kept these.

540
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,320
否则她既不认识我也不认识我们的女儿
Otherwise she neither knows me nor our girl.

541
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
来吧
Come on.

542
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,960
我要负责所有事情
I take care of everything.

543
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,280
我甚至要帮她擦屁股
I even clean her bottom.

544
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
就像我可以照顾自己似的
Like I can take care after myself.

545
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,840
对了，阿加
So, Agah.

546
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
-你退休了吗？-是的
- Are you retired? - Yes.

547
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,720
你老婆叫什么名字？
What was your wife's name?

548
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,880
梅布鲁雷
Mebrure.

549
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,600
她也去世了
She passed away too.

550
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,600
愿她安息
May she rest in peace.

551
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,000
谢谢
Thank you.

552
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,440
阿加，你来这里有什么事情吗？
So Agah, why did you come here?

553
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,360
怎么找到这个地方的？
How did you find this place?

554
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,360
我们认为这边的天气更好
We thought weather is better on this side.

555
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,520
离人群也很远
It's also far away from the crowds.

556
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,840
如果您不介意，我可以用一下洗手间吗？
May I use the bathroom if you don't mind?

557
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,080
我走了很长一段路
I've come a long way.

558
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,400
没问题
Yes, sure.

559
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,320
我也是这样
I have the same problem.

560
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,280
我的膀胱都凹陷了……
My bladder and all are sagged...

561
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
在那边
Look, it's over there.

562
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,360
喝一口吧
Come on, drink.

563
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
快喝！
Drink it woman!

564
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,760
-喝吧，来吧！-对不起
- Drink it, come on! - Excuse me.

565
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
你有远视眼镜吗？
Do you have farsighted glasses?

566
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,000
有，在那边
Yes, over there.

567
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,560
-在架子上-谢谢，我忘了带眼镜
- It's on the shelf. - Thanks, I forgot mine.

568
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,040
我已经忍无可忍了，只喝一口！
I'm running out of patience, just take one sip!

569
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,240
来吧，至少喝一小口
Come on, at least take one sip.

570
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
阿加，你在这附近做什么？
So Agah, what are you doing around here?

571
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,360
我有工作要做
I had work to do.

572
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,240
如果有什么我们能帮忙的尽管说
If there is something we can do, just say it. Don't be shy.

573
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,040
当然了
Yes, of course. I will.

574
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
我九岁的时候
I was nine years old.

575
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,960
那年是1961年
The year was 1961.

576
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,040
我妈妈为我的生日烤了一块蛋糕
My mom had baked a cake for my birthday.

577
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,680
那是第一次
That was the first time.

578
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,200
我许愿吹蜡烛
I made a wish blowing out candles.

579
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,440
我的愿望是这样的
My wish was this...

580
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,800
那时候
Back then

581
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,360
尤里·加加林将成为第一个进入太空的人
Yuri Gagarin was going to be the first man going to space.

582
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,120
我希望他能带我走
And I wished he would take me with him.

583
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
我非常相信我的愿望会成真，
I believed so much that my wish will come true

584
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,560
我准备了一个包，开始等待
I prepared a bag and started waiting.

585
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,800
我以为他们会从苏联大使馆来接我
I thought they will come from The Soviet Embassy to get me.

586
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
但是我听说他们是共产党员
But I was hearing that they were communists.

587
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,480
人们都说“小心，他们是共产党员”
People were saying "Careful, they are communists."

588
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,600
我说那我也要做共产党员
I said then I'll be one too.

589
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
那时候
During that time

590
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,040
一楼住了几个大学生
college students were staying on the first floor.

591
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,720
我妈妈也叫他们共产党员
My mom was calling them communists too

592
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,720
我知道他们在我家的地窖里藏了书
and I knew they had hidden books in our cellar.

593
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,720
我去那里偷了一本
I went there and stole one.

594
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,680
纳齐姆·希克梅特的诗歌集
Poems of Nazim Hikmet.

595
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,800
我记住了其中最短的一个
I found the shortest one and memorized it.

596
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,440
我以为如果俄国人来了，我给他们读这首诗
I thought if the Russians came, I'd read this poem to them

597
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,920
他们就会认为我是他们的一员，然后带我走
and they'd think I was one of them and take me.

598
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,760
长官？
Chief?

599
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,520
总之……
Anyways...

600
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,920
那天是4月12日
The date was April 12th.

601
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,640
航天飞机就要发射了
The space shuttle was going to be launched.

602
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
东方一号
Vostok-1.

603
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,360
但没人来接我
But no one had come for me.

604
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,240
我以为他们把我忘记了
I thought they forgot about me.

605
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
航天飞机发射了
The shuttle was launched.

606
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,720
每个人都在祈祷航天飞机穿过大气层
Everyone was praying for the shuttle to go through the atmosphere.

607
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,800
只有我在祈祷能中途停下，回来接我
Only I was praying for it to return half way around to take me.

608
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,840
也许还有美国人
And maybe the Americans

609
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,280
在祈祷沃斯托克不能进入太空
were praying for Vostok to not go into the space.

610
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
随便了
Whatever.

611
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
那一整天
All day long

612
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,240
在收音机旁边
near the radio

613
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,120
我默默地读那首诗
I read that poem silently.

614
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,360
我的头是泡沫状的云
My head is a foamy cloud.

615
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,200
我的内外都是大海
My inside and outside is a sea.

616
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,840
我是古尔哈内公园的一棵核桃树
I'm a walnut tree in Gulhane Park.

617
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,440
一棵老核桃树，长着树枝和碎片
An old walnut tree. With long branches and pieces.

618
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,640
你和警察都不知道这件事
Neither you are aware of this nor is the police.

619
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,760
我昨天遇到一个女孩，她的名字叫内芙拉·埃尔马斯
I MET A GIRL YESTERDAY. HER NAME WAS NEVRA ELMAS.

620
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,120
每当我读这首诗时，我都会觉得自己去了太空
Whenever I read this poem I feel like I go to space.

621
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,680
我今年65岁了
I am 65 years old now.

622
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,000
我像个孩子一样再次许愿
I made a wish again, just like a child.

623
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,240
当然是不可能实现的愿望
An impossible wish, of course.

624
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,560
你知道我想要什么吗？
Do you know what I wished for?

625
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,600
我想做个好人
To become a good person.

626
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,640
爸，我猜你在睡觉
Dad, I guess you are sleeping.

627
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,360
结束了，我不能再容忍这个人了，我们要搬回伊斯坦布尔
It's over, I can't tolerate this man no more. We are moving back to Istanbul.

628
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,680
我和德瓦一起回去
We are coming together with Deva.

629
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,040
我会再联系你
I'll call you later.

630
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,880
晚安
Good night.

631
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,240
凶杀局的第一位女警官
FIRST FEMALE POLICE OFFICER OF HOMICIDE BUREAU

632
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,200
她唯一的目标是做个好警察，做个好人
HER ONLY GOAL IS TO BE A GOOD POLICEMAN AND A GOOD PERSON
