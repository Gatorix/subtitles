1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,880
Remember the "Personality".

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,840
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,280
greatest name of all times
of flamenco dance...

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,560
Senora Feza.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,320
- Olé.
- Sure, Olé.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,040
Do you think Nevra
was convinced?

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Absolutely.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
So much for been convinced.
She is following us.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,320
The three man who were killed...

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,400
they were on the list
in our website.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,560
You know what this means
don't you?

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,440
"Dog Killer" is following
our website.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,160
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,760
That's why the woman neither
got raped nor she got married.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,616
But we knew she was married.
I decided to follow her to find out...

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,360
where she was going
and who was forcing her to lie.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
That's when you
came into the scene.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
- How did you find out?
- I wanted to see the place.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
As you can see, the place
has gone back in time.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Nevra Elmas.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,400
Mrs Nesrin's daughter.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,240
Don't call me on this
number again.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,960
In fact, it is better
if you forget this number.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,920
What do you want?

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,080
Now, the honourable D.A...

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,720
who has been messing
with my case and why?

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,680
This is number one.

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,440
And the number two...

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,120
who specifically reinstated the
man to the case whom I removed?

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,920
Who is running this case?
What's going on?

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
Nevra!

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,720
- Reyhan.
- Who is Reyhan?

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
[Did you hide your gift?

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,480
[Yes. What do you want from me?

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,200
[To meet me.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,000
[When and where?

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,640
[Soon and nearby.

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,880
[How will I recognize you?

39
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
[There'll be another gift in my hand.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,880
[What is it?

41
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
Deva!

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Grandad!

43
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,800
Turn that thing of.

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,081
Something really bad happened
to me today, because of you.

45
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
Why? What happened?

46
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,656
What's done is done.
None of your business.

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Dad?

48
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,640
What's going on? Why are you
shouting at the boy?

49
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
He put the car's logbook
in a wrong place.

50
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,440
I wasted my morning
looking for it.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Is that what it was?
I thought something happened.

52
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Did you find it anyway?

53
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
Yes, I did.

54
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
But it was too late.

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,200
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Did we find her?

57
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,080
I mean, is this the girl
whom Tayyar raped?

58
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I don't know.

59
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
But even if we found her,
it is too late.

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,720
Much too late.

61
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
Reyhan, wait!

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,600
My poor baby, how could you
take your own life?

63
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,840
She was still a baby.

64
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,160
Don't you remember Reyhan, mum?

65
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,560
No darling,
I don't remember her.

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,160
Was she your friend?

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
We were classmates.

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,880
But I erased almost every memory
related to Kambura.

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
I don't remember anything.

70
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,440
But when I saw the photo
I thought "I know this girl."

71
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,640
"This is Reyhan."

72
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,800
She was slightly older than me.

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
That's right, she was
2 years older than me.

74
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,680
What else do you remember?

75
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I don't know.

76
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
It is not very clear.

77
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,440
I don't think Reyhan committing suicide
is linked to Tayyar's death.

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,080
She committed suicide in 1996.

79
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,880
Tayyar died in 2008.
There are 12 years in between.

80
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,240
Whoever burned down Tayyar's house,
be it Ufuk or somebody else...

81
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
wouldn't have waited 12 years
to take Reyhan's revenge.

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,360
Anyway, it is not yet clear
why Reyhan had committed suicide.

83
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,840
She committed suicide
2 years after we left the town.

84
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,360
How old was she at the time?

85
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
She was 2 years older than me.

86
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
That makes her 14.

87
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,040
Why would she do such a thing?

88
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,520
There are 11 cases of female suicide
in the last 15 years.

89
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
The dates are closer to the time
when Tayyar was murdered.

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,720
If there is a case of rape
it's got be one of them.

91
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,760
I think we should start
by digging into these files.

92
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,920
I don't know any of these girls.

93
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,440
Excuse me.

94
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Hello?

95
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,080
O, K, let's assume that this case
is directly linked to you.

96
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,520
You must know the victim or the killer,
or whatever you want to call them.

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,800
So, it may come to you later,
just like you remembered Reyhan.

98
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,120
Just tell me when and where.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,640
Don't worry, no one will know.

100
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,680
Why don't you try to trust me?

101
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,480
If you ask me, this Reyhan case
is waste of time.

102
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,960
Just one more day.

103
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,120
If I don't get a break
I'll go back to Istanbul.

104
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,600
O.K, whatever you say.
Meanwhile I'll go through the files.

105
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
O.K, I've got to go.

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,240
How are you doing?

107
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,760
I don't know.

108
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,680
Where are you going to start?

109
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,360
I'll check her house first...

110
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,440
and the place
I remember her from.

111
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
The school.

112
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,560
My mum knows our teacher.
He settled here after he got retired.

113
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
I'll talk to him.

114
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't know.

115
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,600
How about you?
Will you go back to Istanbul?

116
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,400
Actually, now that I am here,
I can ask your mother's permission...

117
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
to marry you.

118
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,520
But she'd probably ask
what I do for a living.

119
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,680
And I say to her "I am a foot soldier in
the army of unemployed journalists".

120
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,800
That's why I should go back to Istanbul
and return when I get a job.

121
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,080
- Are you alright dad?
- So so.

122
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,520
Are you still upset about
that logbook thing?

123
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,880
No, no. It doesn't
matter anymore.

124
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,080
- I am sorry.
- Yeah, O.K.

125
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,360
You used to do the same to me
when I was little, remember?

126
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,600
You used to put me through hell
for the smallest thing.

127
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,000
Nothing has changed.

128
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,400
Once I broke the video.

129
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,120
If it wasn't for my mum
he would've kicked me out.

130
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,200
He was so mad.

131
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,600
It was just a video,
a piece of machinery.

132
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,296
I had the right to be mad.
I told you not to mess around with it.

133
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,640
We'd only just bought it.

134
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,456
I wanted to enjoy a good movie
only to find out that it wasn't working.

135
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,440
I'd only just begun
to pay the instalments.

136
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,400
Do you know
how much it cost to get it fixed?

137
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,640
You have such a good memory.
It is scary.

138
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,440
You probably still remember
what the movie was.

139
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,880
Of course I do.

140
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,160
Kramer vs Kramer.
Of course I remember.

141
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,800
How do you remember all this?

142
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,200
I never forget.

143
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,600
Now I remember.
I remember the old.

144
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,800
Now there is even a better movie out.
Beyoğlu vs Beyoğlu.

145
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,920
What do you think? Is it nice?

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,920
I am so glad that I broke that video.
Well done to me.

147
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
- I am off.
- Where to?

148
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,600
I am going on a vacation
with Miss Nükhet.

149
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
Going on a vacation with Nükhet?

150
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,040
What is he going to do
with that woman?

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,440
"That woman" loves me.

152
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,840
Does she know you
well enough to love you?

153
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,680
Because it's easy to love someone
whom you don't really know.

154
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,760
I both know and love you.

155
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,720
Let's see if she can
do the same.

156
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,960
What is he going to do with
Nükhet on vacation?

157
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,080
We'll make love all night.

158
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,040
What did he say?

159
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Do you know...

160
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,680
one day, they'll put us in jars
just like these...

161
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,840
and scientists will say "there used be a
species called "human"...

162
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,480
but now it's extinct.

163
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,640
It became obsolete.

164
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,320
We may have nothing left
to be put in jars.

165
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,840
The way we're going, the human
race will wipe itself off the history.

166
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,800
That's correct too.

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,080
For once, we are
on the same side.

168
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,680
First of all, thanks
for coming Ateş.

169
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,320
You're welcome. I thought this has
got to be important.

170
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,440
Otherwise, why should superintendent
Tolga call a clown?

171
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,400
- Ateş, look...!
- No, no.

172
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
You're right.

173
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,200
I've been a clown for years.
But it is over now.

174
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,240
Well, I am all ears.

175
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,080
Alright...

176
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,240
you know that serial killer thing...

177
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,616
there is someone at the top
interfering with the case.

178
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,360
I can't find out who that is...

179
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,440
neither the reason
why they're doing it.

180
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,280
I know you have connections.

181
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,680
Can you help me find this man?

182
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,240
- I can try.
- Fine, good.

183
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,560
But with one condition...

184
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,360
no breaking news
until this case is solved.

185
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,800
Is that a deal?

186
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
O.K.

187
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,800
O.K, it is a deal.

188
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,440
Let me ask you something.

189
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Go ahead.

190
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,720
How come you trust me?

191
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
Nevra...

192
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,760
Nevra trusts you.

193
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
And I trust Nevra.

194
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
One more question.

195
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,720
You have all the
right to be anxious.

196
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,240
I will share another
information with you.

197
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,960
Have I got everything?
Toothbrush, socks.

198
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,600
I should take a book too.

199
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,640
We seized evidence from
Tufan Elibol's body...

200
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,680
whom the killer used
to throw us off the case.

201
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,880
Do you really have any evidence?

202
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,600
What do you think?

203
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
It is a hoax story.

204
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Let's call it "bonus to
encourage mistake".

205
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
It is better this way.

206
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,720
It means that the killer
shot himself on the foot.

207
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,400
And I can assure you
he will be caught very soon.

208
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,920
I was watching the press conference
about the serial killer.

209
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,880
Were you about to say something?

210
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,160
No, I am going.

211
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Grandad!

212
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Don't you want to see mum
before you leave?

213
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
I am in hurry.
You can give her a kiss for me.

214
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
Mum! Grandad is going.

215
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,040
At least tell us
where you are going?

216
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,640
I am going to
Tanzania for safari.

217
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,960
What am I going to do now?

218
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
I never heard that.

219
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,280
May be, I heard
but never listened.

220
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,040
How can they find evidence?

221
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,280
I washed him thoroughly...

222
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
with bleach.

223
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
Or did I?

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
How can they find evidence?

225
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes, I washed him.

226
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Did I wash him?

227
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,840
No, I didn't. Yes, I did.

228
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,120
It is not possible.
Because I washed the body.

229
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I didn't wash it.

230
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Why?

231
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,320
It is too late now. It is the
end of the road. They got me.

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Nothing you can do.

233
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,480
No, wait. Don't rush.

234
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
No cops at the door.

235
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,520
They should've been here by now.

236
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,800
They may be on their way.

237
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,680
It's been so many days.

238
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,600
They would've been here by now.

239
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,520
I was about to go on vacation.

240
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,240
Relax a bit and
read a nice book.

241
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
I've already read this.

242
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I've just read it.

243
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,760
O.K.

244
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,160
So, this is the case.

245
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,520
Just let it be.

246
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
I'll go and do another one.

247
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,920
This one's already gone.

248
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,040
What is this?

249
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,240
No, this one is in Istanbul.

250
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
What else?

251
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,320
Not this one either.
F..ck off to hell.

252
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,240
Yes, this one will do.

253
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
Business and pleasure in one.

254
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,560
Kill them all.

255
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,640
I think this one will do.

256
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,480
What do you say? Is it O.K?

257
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
This will do.

258
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,680
Are you talking to me?

259
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,040
So, what are we doing?

260
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,840
I thought if we go to a spa,
there'll be herds of old people...

261
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
floating in the water
like buoys.

262
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
It is boring.

263
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,640
I came up with
something different.

264
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,920
- Where?
- It is a surprise.

265
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,240
O.K, that's fine.

266
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
But do you know what the
real surprise was?

267
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,200
When you called me this morning
to tell me that...

268
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,720
we are leaving right away.
That was the real surprise.

269
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,160
You caught me off guard.

270
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,720
Because something
happened yesterday.

271
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
And I made a decision.

272
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,040
You should never put anything
on hold in life.

273
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,880
What happened?

274
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
My kite got stuck on a tree.

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,320
Kite?

276
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,840
Do you mean,
you've been flying kites?

277
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,040
Yes, of course.

278
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,400
You are such an
amazing man Agah.

279
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,320
Without being big headed,
I think I am, a little bit.

280
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,360
What is she doing now?

281
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,200
I don't know. She has been in there
for 10 minutes.

282
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
I'll find out what she is up to.

283
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,960
Listen Firuz...

284
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,120
you made a mistake by getting
caught by Nevra.

285
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,760
And what did I do?

286
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,800
I took your mistake and
blew it out of proportion.

287
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,920
And that mistake grew so big,
it became legit.

288
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,160
But it doesn't mean that
same will happen every time.

289
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,200
Luckily we sealed the crack.

290
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,040
I want no more cracks Firuz.

291
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,960
I don't want any more leaks.

292
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,840
Is that clear?

293
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,960
If my house gets flooded,
you'd be the first one to drown.

294
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
O.K Mr Cemil.

295
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,440
I've been having this done for years
but I am yet to decide.

296
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,360
I wonder who feels better
at the end of the day.

297
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,160
Me or them?

298
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,360
I think I came into this world
to feed the leeches.

299
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

300
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
Yes, thank you.

301
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,000
Not understanding anything
is so nice.

302
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,760
- This is such a nice place.
- Yes, it is.

303
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,800
I've heard Pınarcak was a nice place.
But I never had the chance to visit.

304
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,200
I think there is a waterfall here.
Yes, we'll go there too.

305
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
- Hello.
- Hi.

306
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
- We'd like two rooms.
- Sure, just a second.

307
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,280
Why not a single room?

308
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,880
Do you have your
marriage certificate with you?

309
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
We were married by Imam.

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,560
And there are cameras
on hallways.

311
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,280
How about Muta marriage?

312
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
I am sorry.

313
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Here.

314
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,520
That's what happens
in small places.

315
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,720
Not small, crowded.

316
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,000
I am afraid so.

317
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,040
If you excuse me, I'd like to
take an hour's rest.

318
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,441
I got up very early this morning
and driving tired me out.

319
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,520
Yeah, sure.
I can check my e-mails.

320
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,240
Let's meet downstairs
in one hour.

321
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,200
- O.K, see you.
- See you.

322
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,240
Of course I remember you.

323
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,160
Mrs Nesrin's daughter,
Nevra Elmas.

324
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,920
So, you came to
see your teacher?

325
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,200
I've heard that you've become a cop.
Well done to you.

326
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,040
So, what have you been up to?
Do you like being a cop?

327
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Don't ask.

328
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
It was really bad.

329
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,880
They found Reyhan,
laying on the grass.

330
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,080
You know, on the hill where
they take the herds for grazing.

331
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,720
Reyhan!

332
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,440
Come on!

333
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,480
Reyhan, wait.

334
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,600
I can't keep up.

335
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Thanks.

336
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
Thank you very much sweetheart.

337
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,480
Have you met my wife Nevra?

338
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,840
No. Pleased to meet you.

339
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Enjoy it.

340
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,760
I was a lot younger then.

341
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,720
God, what was I talking about?

342
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,520
Oh yes, Reyhan was laying
on the grass.

343
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,120
And there was a bottle of
rat poison beside her.

344
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
God knows how she got
hold of it.

345
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,520
Such a clever girl. What made her
do such a thing?

346
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,880
What can I say?

347
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,160
You never know what goes on
in someone's head.

348
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,480
Binnaz, come over here.
Sit with us darling.

349
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,200
No thanks. I'll be inside.

350
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
She was really talented.

351
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,960
She used to write
great compositions.

352
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,440
She was a late starter at school.
But she was really smart.

353
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,280
She was very smart.
She was like a diamond.

354
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
And talented.

355
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,360
She only had a granny.

356
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,760
She had nobody else.

357
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,680
And she passed away.

358
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,600
Well sir...

359
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,120
as far as you can remember...

360
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,920
do you think something
might've happened to Reyhan...

361
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,360
after we left town?

362
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,520
No, I don't think so.

363
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,080
As far as I remember,
there was no wrong doing.

364
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,760
But she was missing school
as of late.

365
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,240
She was there one day
but not the next.

366
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
Her file says cause of death is
suicide due to heavy depression.

367
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,160
Have you noticed anything?
Was she depressed?

368
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,120
As far as I remember, Reyhan was a
cheerful girl with a big smile.

369
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,880
But it is not possible to know
what's been happening deep inside.

370
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,200
Sir, can I use the toilet?

371
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,120
What is this?
Is this how I trained you?

372
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,400
You have to raise your hand
and ask for permission first.

373
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,240
I was joking.

374
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,080
Nevra, my sweetheart.
I was only joking.

375
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,360
Go ahead.
Binnaz will show you the way.

376
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,280
Damn! I'll be late.

377
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,040
Did you know Reyhan?

378
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
No.

379
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,520
I am not from
around here anyway.

380
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
I've come from the village.

381
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,120
When did you come to Kambura?

382
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,520
After I got married.

383
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,800
I was around 15 years old.
That's how I ended up here.

384
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,120
Fifteen?

385
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,920
How old was Mr Tahsin at the time?

386
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,560
In his fifties.

387
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
I see.

388
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Thanks.

389
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Do you have something
to tell me Binnaz?

390
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,840
I don't know that girl, Reyhan, but...!

391
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Binnaz!

392
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
Can you pour me some tea?

393
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,080
I was new around here.
May be only a year.

394
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,800
I heard that a girl
took her own life.

395
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,840
God almighty! Can't she hear me?

396
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,680
Binnaz! I asked you
to fill my glass.

397
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Binnaz!

398
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,960
One day, while he was at school
a woman popped-by.

399
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,680
She said she was
Reyhan's granny.

400
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,240
She said she found a notebook
hidden inside her pillow.

401
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,000
She said "she wrote down
everything here".

402
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,200
"This may reveal clues
as to why she killed herself".

403
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,880
Why did she bring
the notebook to you?

404
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
Binnaz!

405
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,200
Why did she bring it to you?

406
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,080
She was illiterate.

407
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,880
She said "give this to the teacher,
he'd know what to do with it".

408
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,640
And what did you do?

409
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Binnaz!

410
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,160
I didn't do anything.
I just took a quick glance.

411
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Then?

412
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I gave it back to her and
told her to take it to the police station.

413
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,600
She said she already did.

414
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,760
But the police had sent her away saying
that the case is already closed.

415
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,240
I told her to go to the courthouse.

416
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,120
- What was in the notebook?
- I don't know.

417
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,480
I was illiterate at the time too.

418
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,920
Why did you tell her
to take it to the courthouse...

419
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,720
instead of handing it
over to Mr.Tahsin?

420
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,256
I wasn't about to give the poor girl's
notebook to a man...

421
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,160
who took a child as a wife.

422
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,520
He loves me. We'll get married.

423
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,040
I'll be a bride.

424
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,560
You two have been here for ages.

425
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,800
I have been asking you to
pour me a cup of tea.

426
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
You wouldn't have
known if I died.

427
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,280
S... it!

428
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
This is Hamza.

429
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,520
I am Nevra, the deputy chief.

430
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,320
I sure recognize you.
How can I not, anyway?

431
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,720
How could you forget
the one who put you away?

432
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,880
What do you want this time?

433
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,120
Has your brother Tayyar
ever mentioned a girl named Reyhan?

434
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,520
A 14 year old from Kambura.
Reyhan.

435
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,280
Can you hear me Hamza?
Yes, I can.

436
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,520
Did you say Reyhan?

437
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,400
Yes, Reyhan.

438
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,120
What's in it for me?

439
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,920
- Do you know the girl?
- I don't.

440
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,320
But let's say, I heard the name.

441
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,840
What can you do for me?

442
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,760
I tell you what I'll do, I'll come over
there, lock you in solitary confinement...

443
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,160
and throw away the key.
How about that?

444
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,080
You have such a quick temper, sis.

445
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,560
Woman with a short fuse.

446
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,840
Look, I don't know much
about this Reyhan girl.

447
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,120
This is the first time
I hear the name after a long time.

448
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,280
But now, I remember.

449
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,920
Tayyar kept repeating
her name when he was stoned.

450
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,480
When we asked about the girl
he used to say things like...

451
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,480
"poor girl, they wasted her".

452
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,280
We used to ask him after he sobered up
but he couldn't remember anything.

453
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,200
Perhaps he remembered
but avoided the subject with us.

454
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,000
Why didn't you tell me anything?

455
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,640
When I've asked you
if Tayyar raped anyone...

456
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,400
why didn't you mention Reyhan?

457
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,400
You are so gullible sis.

458
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,760
Tayyar was an alcoholic.
He was stoned.

459
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,480
He used to say "they wasted her",
not "I wasted her".

460
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,880
I'll tell you what...

461
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,800
a drunken man can do
anything except one thing...

462
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,320
he can't lie.

463
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,560
If he got up to no good
he would've told us.

464
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,080
It means that
somebody else did it.

465
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,920
So, what is it?

466
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,280
The girl has gone and
the case is closed, isn't it?

467
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,960
Keep quiet Tayyar.

468
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,360
Keep quiet for what?

469
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,360
She was wasted
in broad day-light.

470
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,960
Poor Reyhan got wasted.

471
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,760
Shut up!

472
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,480
Do you call yourselves men?

473
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,720
What did you want
from the poor girl?

474
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,000
I am listening.

475
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,160
Sir, this plate is no
longer registered.

476
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
What do you mean?

477
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,720
It was dropped from the system in 1998
and the vehicle was scrapped.

478
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
I see.

479
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,560
- Here is your coffee.
- Thanks mum.

480
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,840
Mum...

481
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,240
I think really bad things
happened here.

482
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Do you mean the burned house?

483
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,560
No, not that. I mean Reyhan.

484
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,400
I think some people
did very bad things to her.

485
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,640
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

486
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,200
But whatever happened,
people of Kambura are responsible.

487
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,840
Why are you laughing?

488
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,120
What's going on?
What are you doing?

489
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,840
Do you know someone
called Reyhan?

490
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,240
- Who, who did you say?
- Reyhan.

491
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,760
- Nevra's schoolmate.
- Mum!

492
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,720
The girl who committed suicide
when she was 14.

493
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,760
I swear, I don't know her.
How would I know her anyway?

494
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Look, if you're hiding anything...!

495
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,960
Mum, calm down. Come here.

496
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,680
- God almighty.
- Calm down.

497
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Sit down.

498
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Uncle Selim...

499
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,440
you know my friend, Reyhan...

500
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,800
something really bad
happened to her...

501
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,320
here in Kambura.

502
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,920
I am not too sure...

503
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,040
but you know the killer
who picks victims from Kambura...

504
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
I think he kills the
ones who did evil to Reyhan.

505
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,800
If you know anything about this
or have an idea...

506
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,120
please tell me. Don't be afraid.

507
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,440
If you know anything but not telling me,
that's when you should be afraid.

508
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,560
Because the killer
will eventually find you too.

509
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,800
I told you, I haven't done anything.
I only threw a small piece of stone.

510
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,680
Look here, you b... stard!

511
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,080
Just spill the beans.

512
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,800
You said he was having
dreams about it...

513
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,240
but thinking it was real because
he was avoiding his medication.

514
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,400
Was it worth it?

515
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,360
Was it worth you
hiding it from me?

516
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,840
What did you think
you were hiding? This?

517
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,800
That you had a husband
who lynched people.

518
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,280
What good did that do?

519
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,840
You don't trust him tiny bit.

520
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,880
So much so that you belive he would do
something to 14 year old girl.

521
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,960
And you even asked him.

522
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,360
Mum!

523
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
Why?

524
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,520
Why have you become
the woman you are?

525
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,160
Why have such a life?

526
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
I don't know any other life.

527
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,840
All I knew "Stand on your own feet,
be independent, be strong..."

528
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,160
you are an orphan".

529
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
"You have a deceased husband".

530
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,840
"And a little girl in your arms".

531
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,400
Don't ever fall.
But how can you not?

532
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,520
You are young, working...

533
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,720
trying to make a living.

534
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,320
But you are not a man.

535
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
You are a woman.

536
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,760
Wish you knew how you used to look at
me when I held you in my arms.

537
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,520
I was frightened
of this world Nevra.

538
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,000
You have to hold on to a man.

539
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,680
While trying to find the right one...

540
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,640
I myself became a man.

541
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,840
I turned into a man.

542
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,200
When you asked me...

543
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,160
why I hid it from you...

544
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,880
I was afraid to be left
on my own...

545
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,520
if they took Selim away.

546
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,360
I was scared of being on my own.

547
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,280
I always took cover behind men.

548
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,560
In order to avoid being alone and
being labelled "whore".

549
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,920
But you weren't alone.

550
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,320
You had me.

551
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,400
And you still have.

552
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,640
Why were you so scared?

553
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,640
My little darling...

554
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,360
why do you think Reyhan
took her own life?

555
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,600
F... ck!

556
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
F... ck!

557
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,880
- Nükhet, hi.
- Hi.

558
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,200
Did you have a nice sleep?

559
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,720
Having a rest for about an hour
was refreshing.

560
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,120
Let's go and have a nice dinner.

561
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,160
There must be so many
things to see here.

562
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,560
Have you ever been
around this way?

563
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
No, never.

564
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,120
Look, such an interesting
name for a town, Kambura.

565
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,720
Why give such a strange name
to the place you live?

566
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,560
Maybe, it was others
who named it.

567
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,160
Very interesting.

568
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,360
I feel sorry for the residents.
Yes, yes.

569
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,440
Finally, I got hold of you.

570
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,720
The meeting has
only just finished.

571
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,800
How is Ankara? Still hot
and dry in the summer?

572
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,560
It certainly is.

573
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,920
What is the situation?
Did you find anything?

574
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,080
I digged into the ministries.
But no avail.

575
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,800
You will have to cough up
some dosh.

576
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,320
No dosh, I told you
it is a favour.

577
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,680
You say favour but asking for the most
precious item in the black market.

578
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,280
I have asked million and one people.
Nobody knows anything.

579
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,120
We have to go in reverse order.

580
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,680
What do you mean?

581
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,440
We'll get in touch with the key people
through our contacts.

582
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,880
Then we'll make them talk.

583
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,000
We are not going to ask
who is messing with your case.

584
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,640
We'll do the opposite.

585
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,280
We'll bait them with
a lot of names...

586
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,440
who supposedly interfering
with the case.

587
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,720
We'll cast the line and wait.

588
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,000
- Wait for what?
- For bureaucratic ego to take over.

589
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,040
Because whoever is pulling the strings
or acting like a middle man...

590
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,120
will get beaten by his ego
and begin to talk.

591
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,720
He will say
"f... ck off, I am the one".

592
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,360
This is a long shot.
These people are not stupid.

593
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,680
They are stupid.

594
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,496
The only thing that sets those
who wear the same style of suit...

595
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,880
apart from one another is to brag
about whose back you are scratching.

596
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,600
You must get
really bored in Ankara.

597
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,200
It's because it's hot and dry here
in the summer.

598
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,600
You haven't eaten anything.

599
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,200
I am not hungry mum.

600
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,840
What are you doing?

601
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,240
Trying to figure out
when everything started and...

602
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,880
in what order it progressed.

603
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,280
Nevra!

604
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,960
Have you ever heard a man
called Cemil Havran?

605
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,680
Yes. I even talked to him
on the phone the other day.

606
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,880
He sent his regards to you.

607
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,560
I never got around to tell you,
thinking they may harm Selim.

608
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,560
Are you still hiding
something mum?

609
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,680
Isn't that enough of secrets?

610
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,520
I am not hiding a secret or anything.
I am telling you now.

611
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,680
Cemil almost owns
whole of Kambura.

612
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,520
Nothing ever takes place
without his knowledge.

613
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,600
I think you'd better talk to him.

614
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,520
Was he the one who
threatened Uncle Selim?

615
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,560
He wouldn't do it himself. He would
get his monkeys do it instead.

616
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,840
You know Vural, the guy
who's been hanging around.

617
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:19,720
Vural.

618
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,600
Apparently he warned Selim
not to talk about the fire.

619
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,400
I see.

620
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,760
It means we have to turn
Kambura on its head.

621
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,080
Don't worry, I'll talk to him.

622
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,200
Mum...

623
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,360
we came here in 1993, didn't we?

624
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,840
Stayed here for a year.

625
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,160
1994.

626
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,320
I think it was August.

627
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,040
Left in August.

628
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,640
Reyhan had a notebook.

629
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,840
If it is as precious as to be
hidden under a pillow...

630
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,560
it was more likely a diary.

631
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,960
Where is that diary now?

632
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:21,120
If these notes were taken
by Reyhan...

633
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,520
the killer has the diary.

634
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,920
Let's assume that she wrote this
on my birthday.

635
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,640
March 18th.

636
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,080
Nevra...

637
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,320
has Reyhan given you
a birthday present?

638
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,680
I don't remember.

639
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,680
[It's Nevra's birthday today]
[I got her a present].

640
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,800
- When I set out to write this book...
- Life is Traffic.

641
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,400
I did a lot of research on accidents.

642
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,880
- Here you are sir.
- Good.

643
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,240
Go on, open it.
It may cause a problem.

644
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,960
The guy himself is the problem.
And I am here to solve it.

645
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,560
By the way, he won't know about this.
Am I clear?

646
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Yes sir.

647
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,880
There was an incident.
I never forget it.

648
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,480
Do you remember the TV show...

649
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,120
the contest...

650
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,600
where contestants gather around a car
and place their hands on it.

651
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,640
Yes, I remember it. They used to
spend days in that position.

652
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,760
A man spent 37 hours
with his hand on the car.

653
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:04,720
He places his hand on the car
and just stands there.

654
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,120
He was the one
who lasted the longest.

655
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,520
So, he wins the car.

656
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,800
He takes the car away...

657
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,280
and on his very first day on the road
he gets involved in a horrific accident.

658
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,280
A truck hits the car
on the driver's side.

659
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,200
That is really bad.

660
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,040
And there is more.

661
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,920
Do you know what happens?

662
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,120
He loses his right hand, the one he used
to touch the car for 37 hours.

663
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,160
Do you think it has a meaning?

664
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,400
And if there is a meaning,
what is it?

665
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,360
Where is that guy now?

666
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,520
They were talking about
having dinner.

667
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,720
There is only one place to eat around
here which is at the end of the road.

668
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,560
O.K, fine. Thanks.

669
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,440
I met a girl today.
Her name is Nevra Elmas.

670
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,120
She is the only one I trust.
Because Nevra understands me.

671
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,000
It's Nevra's birthday today.
I got her a present.

672
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,080
Me and Nevra share a secret.

673
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,720
Did you really kiss?

674
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,240
You promised not to tell anyone.

675
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,400
Of course we kissed.

676
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,720
Swear to God?

677
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,560
You don't believe anything.
I told you so many times.

678
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,560
I told Nevra everything.
But she doesn't believe me.

679
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,960
I don't eat fruit.

680
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,656
Because when the sugar in fruit
gets in reaction with alcohol...

681
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,120
it turns into fat.

682
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,920
Move your hand.

683
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,600
Reyhan.

684
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,040
Who remembers?

685
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,080
Who remembers?

686
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,800
Tayyar!

687
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,440
Tayyar remembers you.

688
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,360
He said "they wasted
the poor girl".

689
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,120
If Tayyar remembers
so do the others.

690
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,200
All of them, they all remember.

691
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,600
Whole of Kambura remembers.

692
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,320
They just pretend
that they don't.

693
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,840
Who am I speaking to?

694
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:55,600
Not to your friend in Ankara.

695
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,800
That's for sure.

696
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,640
I don't think you should
speak to him again either.

697
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:03,680
Save his a..ss
and save your own.

698
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,360
Stick to what you know.
Write 3rd page articles.

699
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,840
Because as you turn the pages
in a newspaper...

700
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,280
you come to the pages
with political issues...

701
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,040
and that's where
the scenery changes.

702
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,880
You may end up being locked up.

703
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,640
And when it comes to trying
to prove your innocence...

704
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,920
the trial would last
at least a year.

705
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,760
Have mercy on yourself.

706
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,200
O.K?

707
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,240
Don't get yourself mixed up with
complicated businesses.

708
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,840
Because next time that phone rings,
it won't be for a warning.

709
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,840
We can leave if you're ready.

710
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
This way.

711
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,440
What is it?

712
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,160
Police. Don't touch anything.

713
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
O.K.

714
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,720
We used to drink wine too.

715
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,240
But the cheapest one.

716
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,320
It was called the "dog killer".
Have you heard of it?

717
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,080
Do you know what was
written on the label?

718
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,800
In vino veritas.

719
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,520
We used to wonder what it meant.

720
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
What does it mean?

721
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,720
The truth is hidden in the wine.

722
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,800
- Leave me alone.
- Come on.

723
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,640
- B... stards!
- Come on.

724
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,000
Leave me alone.
I can find my own way.

725
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,480
F... cking gypsy!

726
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,200
He's got such a big mouth.

727
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,360
He thinks he can
take over the place.

728
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,240
I know you don't like gypsies.

729
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,520
I f..cking hate them.

730
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,360
My dad says they should
f... ck off somewhere else.

731
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,320
But saying is not enough Ufuk.

732
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,240
Look how he forces
himself on us.

733
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,600
Best thing to do is set his bed alight.
Let the b... stard burn to ashes.

734
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,200
He is a walking alcohol bottle.

735
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,040
Just one spark would be enough
to blow him up.

736
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,720
But we need a hero
to do the deed.

737
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,960
Look around you.

738
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,680
Everybody is sitting all quiet,
tails between their legs.

739
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,880
He might've as well
spat on their faces.

740
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,160
We need someone to sort him out.

741
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,120
I'll do it.

742
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,400
I swear I can do it.

743
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,960
I will burn that gypsy so bad they
will ever dare to return to Kambura.

744
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,360
Now, this is the man talking.

745
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,200
Come on, bottoms up.

746
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,560
Why are you calling me?

747
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,960
What do you want from me
in the middle of the night?

748
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,560
Yes, Deva told me.

749
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,120
O.K, just send the divorce papers.
I will sign them.

750
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,160
What do you mean
you changed your mind?

751
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,800
How can you?
Do you think this is a game?

752
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,400
No, I don't want you
to come to Turkey.

753
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,440
I have nothing to say to you.

754
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,600
The marriage is over.
There is nothing between us.

755
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,000
Don't ever call me again.

756
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,376
Who was it, calling
this time at night?

757
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Deva.

758
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,680
He was looking for something
but couldn't find it.

759
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,080
Called to ask me.

760
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,400
I don't think he found it.

761
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,360
I'll be right back.

762
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,320
- Thank you very much Nükhet.
- What for?

763
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,440
I haven't felt this
peaceful for ages.

764
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,960
And you are the reason.

765
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,120
I feel like I am going
to live forever.

766
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,640
I feel like me and you will be sitting
here, watching the stars forever.

767
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,680
As if it will never end.

768
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,160
It will not end Agah.

769
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,520
We will relive tonight
every time we think about it.

770
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:03,160
Under the stars.

771
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,200
As long as we remember.

772
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,200
That's what the poet said.

773
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,240
Life is a memory.
You'll die when you forget.

774
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,720
So true. Who said it?

775
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
I forgot.

776
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,560
I washed him.

777
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:45,920
Sure I washed him.

778
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,480
I washed Tufan.
They can't find any evidence.

779
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,080
I remembered. See?

780
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,400
You dirty crooks. I washed him.

781
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:07,640
Well, now that I am awake...!

782
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,800
It's not here.
How could you forget it?

783
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,200
How could you forget it?

784
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,240
Wait here. I'll be right back.

785
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,480
- Where have you been?
- I am here aren't I?

786
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,480
Did you tell your dad
that we are going to get married?

787
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:28,240
No, I didn't have the chance.
But I have something else to tell you.

788
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,400
Remember I told you I have a brother?
Cemil.

789
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,040
Yes, that's the one.

790
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,840
He said "now that Reyhan kissed you,
would she kiss me too".

791
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,160
What are you talking about?

792
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,480
Wait.

793
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,176
He said he will tell everybody,
people will be calling you names...

794
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,840
and we won't be able
to get married.

795
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,040
Hello Reyhan.

796
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,200
How are you?

797
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,320
What's going on here
so early in the morning?

798
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:49,760
[Do you remember me?
