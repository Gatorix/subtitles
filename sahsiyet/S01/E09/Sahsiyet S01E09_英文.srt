1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,040
Remember...

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,600
Why did he kill them? Who are they?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,440
They have 80 priors between them.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,840
They're not connected to Kambura,
though. No fingerprints, either.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,200
But CCTV caught the crime.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,480
Let me guess. Cat costume.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,440
Here's your mafia.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,560
PERSONAL

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,880
TONIGHT, A STAR FELL FROM THE SKY

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
I MADE A WISH

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,920
<i>One day, when I was on night duty,
a man came to see me</i>.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,720
<i>I remember every word he said to me</i>.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,080
"You're going to forget about
what happened."

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,600
<i>"Or you'll disappear," he said</i>.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,160
Hamza Kaymak, right?

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,080
His photos will be everywhere
in half an hour.

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,160
Hamza is going to tell them
everything he knows. It can't be helped.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,200
You're going to tell them
what you know as well, Vural.

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
Without forgetting about Ufuk.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,280
<i>Take a seat, Vural</i>.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,960
Hello again.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,720
You told me to come see you
if I needed anything.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,040
Would you kindly die for me?

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,720
Firuz, this won't get me
in trouble, right?

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>What did you find</i>?

26
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,440
<i>I found some blood on the crime scene
that didn't belong to the victim</i>.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>It probably belongs to the killer</i>.

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,800
- Is this the DNA report?
- Yes.

29
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,480
<i>You think being involved
with my daughter makes you immortal</i>?

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,960
<i>If I'm not spilling your blood for now</i>,

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,520
who would you like to take your place?

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
<i>How about your blood brother</i>?

33
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,160
<i>That works, right?
That works beautifully</i>.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,880
Isn't that the corpse from the forest?

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,160
Reply to them. Let's see who they are.

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,480
<i>You know what I wished for</i>?

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
<i>To be a good person</i>.

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,000
But...

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,440
She remembers everything.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Good morning to you, Agah.

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
No killing anyone today, deal?

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,040
Today, we're going to go...

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,200
We're going to watch
Cemil's show...

44
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
No off-hours work today.

45
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
And we're going to see Feza.

46
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,080
No, that's tomorrow.

47
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,200
Fine. Sure.

48
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,080
Sure.

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Feza is tomorrow.

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,520
Yes.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,640
Sleep, wake, visit Feza.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,840
GOOD MORNING DEVA.
I'M GOING OUT.

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,720
EAT SOMETHING BEFORE
YOU LEAVE FOR SCHOOL.

54
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
No, don't do it.

55
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
Go get a seat on the front row.

56
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
You ready?

57
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,800
Go on, shoot.
The last one was pure luck. Come on!

58
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
I was a goalie for many years.
I even played for FC Sishane.

59
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,720
- I'm shooting the ball.
- Go on.

60
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,000
- Goal!
- Out!

61
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,200
- How's that out!
- That was a goal. You need glasses!

62
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
No, the post is from here to there.
That was out!

63
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,520
Son! How many times
have I told you not to play soccer here?

64
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,720
Take your ball and play somewhere else!

65
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,760
He's right. So disrespectful!

66
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
- You can't play soccer here!
- That was a goal!

67
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,600
- That was a goal!
- Like hell it was. It was out.

68
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,080
- Dad?
- Zuhal? I didn't realize you were here.

69
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,400
I came with Cemil.

70
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,640
- Did you know Tayfun?
- Of course. Back from Kambura.

71
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,240
Cemil was devastated, dad.
He's grief-stricken.

72
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,880
- I can imagine.
- He's devastated.

73
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,920
I can imagine.
They were like brothers.

74
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,440
- I should go give my condolences.
- Alright. I'll see you at home tonight.

75
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,400
- You still remember how to get home?
- Do you?

76
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,640
The ballistics report came today.

77
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,280
The bastard blew up the greenhouse
using a timed C4 blast.

78
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,920
Not a simple C4. A timed one!

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,600
He has an armory or something.
He could start a war tomorrow.

80
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,720
I have something else to tell you.

81
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,560
I was in a meeting today.

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,560
The prosecutor general and the police
commissioner wanted me to pay a visit.

83
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,720
Unless I make an arrest
within one week, we're done.

84
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,480
I'll be the first to go.

85
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,336
Then, just so you don't get offended,
you two will be fired as well.

86
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,320
This is our last shot.

87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
We have to find something.

88
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,760
If we can't, they'll boot us
and bring in someone who can.

89
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,920
I should ask you if that's clear,
but you're pretty bright, so no need.

90
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,440
CEMÄ°L HAVRAN
KAMBURANS FOUNDATION

91
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Easy.

92
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,480
My condolences...

93
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,640
My condolences...

94
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,080
- Oh dear Cemil, my condolences...
- Agah...

95
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,360
What am I to do now?

96
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,000
He was such an angel.

97
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,240
- Come stand by me.
- Stay strong, son. Stay strong.

98
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,760
- Thanks.
- Can't stand against fate.

99
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,560
- Thank you.
- I told him so many times.

100
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you doing, running greenhouses
in the middle of nowhere?

101
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,920
- Come on, work with me.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,160
I begged him to accept, but he wouldn't.
Money meant nothing to him.

103
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,720
Such a dirty world we live in.

104
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,040
Stay strong, son.
Can't stand against fate.

105
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,680
What fate?

106
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,080
They blew up a florist using a bomb.

107
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,240
- Thank you.
- You see that casket? It's empty.

108
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,040
They couldn't find his corpse.
It was blown to bits.

109
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,960
Get a hold of yourself, Cemil.
Whoever did it is bound to get caught.

110
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,560
No. No...

111
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,280
I'll find him. And when I do,
that son of a bitch will...

112
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,080
Hush! Cemil, we're in a mosque. Don't sin.

113
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,920
Agah...

114
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
That bastard stabbed me in the heart.

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,160
- How did you know the departed?
- He was a good man.

116
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,880
- How did you know the departed?
- He was a good man.

117
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,560
- Do you give him your blessing?
- We do.

118
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,280
- Do you give him your blessing?
- We do.

119
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
- Do you give him your blessing?
- We do.

120
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
Al-Fatiha!

121
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
This girl,

122
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,160
the girl Tayyar raped...

123
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,160
What are you thinking?

124
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,200
What did Vural say?

125
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,640
The fireman, what was his name? Halis.

126
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,600
- He's dead, right?
- Yes?

127
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,040
- He knew about what happened.
- If Vural's telling the truth. Yes.

128
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,240
So Halis tampered
with the report to protect Ufuk.

129
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,800
So he knew about the girl.
Ufuk must've told him.

130
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,560
I'm wracking my brain...

131
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,960
Ufuk came to us of his own volition.
He wanted to tell us everything.

132
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,520
- Why didn't he ever mention that girl?
- You saw how he was.

133
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,320
How can we know
what's going through Ufuk's mind?

134
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,440
Anyway. Let's get back to
how Halis knows about the girl.

135
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,680
Either Ufuk told him,
or he'd heard it somewhere else.

136
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,160
- Kambura is a small place, after all.
- Yes...

137
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Alright.

138
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,360
If Halis knew...

139
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,600
Why wouldn't anyone else know?

140
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,760
What if they...

141
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
What if

142
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,760
they all knew about the rape,

143
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,440
but didn't say or do anything?

144
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,720
The girl is speaking to me.
See what she's saying?

145
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,560
Save me, Nevra.

146
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,320
I MET A GIRL TODAY
HER NAME IS NEVRA YILMAZ

147
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,240
I TRUST ONLY HER
BECAUSE NEVRA GETS ME

148
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
She's been speaking to me
through him this whole time.

149
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
All of it.

150
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,360
So Tayyar...

151
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,880
Raped this girl.
He raped her ten years ago.

152
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,520
He threatened and scared her somehow.

153
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,680
She didn't want to come forward.

154
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,680
So all these murders
are revenge for that girl.

155
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,360
If we find the girl,
we will have found him.

156
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,840
Whoever's committing the murders
is someone who knows the girl.

157
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,280
Just as Ufuk killed the rapist...

158
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,760
He's killing all the people
who stood by and did nothing.

159
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,880
- So they're the silent perpetrators.
- Exactly. Exactly.

160
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,520
We need to find her.
We should go to Kambura immediately.

161
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,680
And do what?

162
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Get on the PA system
and ask the whole town whom Tayyar raped?

163
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
No, not like that.

164
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:24,120
But if we assume that
she was a young girl ten years ago,

165
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,800
I'm going to gather all women
between the ages of 25 and 50

166
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
in the county and talk to them.

167
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,480
Do you think it will work?

168
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,960
Do you have any other suggestions?

169
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,000
Agah? Agah!

170
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
Taci?

171
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,240
I thought I knew you
when I saw you at a distance.

172
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,520
- Years go by so fast, huh, Agah?
- Yes. They do.

173
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Do you have some time?
Let's go sit somewhere.

174
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,160
- No, I wasn't going to...
- Wasn't going to what?

175
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,800
- I have an appointment.
- With whom?

176
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,280
With myself.

177
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,840
Come on. I've found you again
after all these years.

178
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,240
I'm not letting go.
I'm having a terrible day as it is.

179
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,800
It's about Tayfun... He was so young.

180
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,920
- Cemil's devastated, of course.
- I know. Devastated, yes.

181
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,120
Curse the bastard that did it!

182
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,800
Come on, don't play hard to get.
We can take my car.

183
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,920
My car's right over there.
Son, bring my car over.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
- Sure, if you really want to.
- Let's go.

185
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
- When one's time has come...
- Excuse me?

186
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,120
My bag's in the car. I should go fetch it.

187
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,160
Deren KoroÄlu...

188
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,160
I MET A GIRL TODAY

189
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,920
As the founding members
of the Dog Slayer Fan Club...

190
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,800
We formally accept you into our ranks.

191
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,960
Welcome, all of you.

192
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,720
Keeping true to tradition,
we're going to celebrate

193
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,560
with some Dog Slayer.

194
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,720
A few Dog Slayers, in fact.

195
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,960
- Arda, right?
- Yes.

196
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,520
It's really strange...

197
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,400
It's a really weird coincidence.

198
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,200
You're strolling through the forest,
looking to take some footage.

199
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,240
And what do you know,
you run into a corpse.

200
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
That's exactly what happened.
We were really surprised, as well.

201
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,840
It's really hard to get hold of a body.

202
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,160
- We found one hanging from a tree.
- They apparently grow on trees, right?

203
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,600
Alright, then.

204
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Cheers to Dog Slayer.

205
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
So? What do we do now?

206
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
Art.

207
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
- What's this?
- Tomorrow's article.

208
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,240
You think this is why I called you over?

209
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,920
I have something else to ask you.

210
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,760
Like what?

211
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,120
Like are you alright?

212
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
I'm fine, thank you.

213
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,560
We can cover you
if you need some vacation time.

214
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,760
No...

215
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm serious. We're doing alright.

216
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,680
The tourism agencies keep calling us,
asking us to send someone on vacation.

217
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,320
It's advertising for them.
You can take a few days off.

218
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,840
Take in the sights,
have some delicious food.

219
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,360
And when you come back, write about it.

220
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
It will do you good, won't it?

221
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,400
- I'm already good.
- You're already good? Are you now?

222
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
What's this then?

223
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,560
What's this you wrote?

224
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,680
Look at this.

225
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Fake fire brigade reports.

226
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,720
Fake health bills.

227
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760
Heavy penal court judges taking bribes.

228
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,720
And that's not the half of it.
It goes on and on.

229
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,680
I'll read out some. Where was that?

230
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Here.

231
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Listen.

232
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,480
"Perhaps, including
the civilian administrative chief,"

233
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,080
every single prominent person
in the county knew about the incident.

234
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,880
Which is why
this doesn't concern only Kambura.

235
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,360
If there is a crime,

236
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,320
and if that crime was whitewashed,

237
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,480
this concerns the whole country.

238
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,120
And if that crime is the killing
of a family of seven in a fire,

239
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,880
"we were all burned in that fire.
We just don't realize it."

240
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,760
What happened to you, son?

241
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,560
What do you mean? I'm doing my job.

242
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,800
- You used to write such pretty things.
- Yes.

243
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,640
I used to write
about shit that didn't matter.

244
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
Listen, Ates.
I can't publish this article.

245
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,200
I know what will happen to me
if I chose to publish this article.

246
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,560
I'll get 40 phone calls within the minute.

247
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,720
Forgive me,
but I don't have time for that.

248
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,320
Then...

249
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,960
You forgive me as well.

250
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,520
Look, Ates...

251
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,480
I'll put it in terms you'll understand.

252
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,200
If you insist on
getting this article published,

253
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,840
you can no longer work
for this paper. You got that?

254
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,080
I never worked for this paper.

255
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,200
I'm just now starting to work here.
I haven't done any real work in years.

256
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,840
But we're not in the same industry.

257
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,240
That's why I bid you good luck...

258
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,960
- And lots of profit!
- Ates! Ates!

259
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,920
Ates, get back here!

260
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,080
Enjoy your day, guys.

261
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,840
- Hello?
- Hello?

262
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,280
- Nevra, I just resigned.
- Congratulations. How does it feel?

263
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
Like I'm myself.

264
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm feeling like myself
for the first time in a long while.

265
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm happy to hear that.

266
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,640
- Can I call you back later?
- Sure.

267
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,880
Finally!

268
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,240
It will do you good, Ates!

269
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,760
We sent word to every house.
But some of them are at work,

270
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
- All the others are inside.
- Alright. Thank you.

271
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,480
- Did you put the board up?
- Yes.

272
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,480
All you're achieving right now
is scaring those people, and that's it.

273
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,400
Ladies. We'll ask the men to leave.

274
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,560
They'll leave us alone in here.
Woman to woman.

275
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,240
- But I'd like to...
- We'll be fast. Don't worry.

276
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,520
Come on, let's have some tea together.
I'm buying. Come on.

277
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
My name is Nevra. Nevra YÄ±lmaz.

278
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
We know who you are.
We've been watching you on TV.

279
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,160
Good. Good.

280
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Then you also should know
that I lived here for a short while.

281
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,840
You could say I'm a Kamburan, in a way.

282
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
I'd like you to share

283
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,720
everything I say here today
with your friends at home.

284
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
- Is that a deal?
- Sure, we'll tell them.

285
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,400
But I have food cooking at home.
Whatever it is, make it quick.

286
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,760
I'd like you to take out your phones
and save this number to your contacts.

287
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,200
You can call this number 24/7,
whenever you want.

288
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,560
Go on.

289
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,520
We have food cooking at home.
We wouldn't want them to get burnt.

290
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,520
Do you have it?
Save it as Nevra the Cop.

291
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,440
Ladies...

292
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,680
Today, or yesterday, or a year ago...

293
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Or some day in the past, no matter when.

294
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,120
If you've been harassed or raped,
please call this number.

295
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,000
I'll be the only one
who answers the phone,

296
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,320
and I'll be the only one
who'll know who's called.

297
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,560
I give you my word as a woman.

298
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,880
What if they do call?
What will you do about it?

299
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,600
Whatever the caller wants me to.

300
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,840
Not more, not less.

301
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,400
Are you sick?
Caught a cold or something?

302
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,840
Yes. I'll tell you about it some time.

303
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,920
- So? You live here now?
- Yeah.

304
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,560
No more home.

305
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,400
This is my home.

306
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,120
Isn't it hard?

307
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,880
Sometimes, sure.

308
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,440
But it's automatic.
Everything here's automatic.

309
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,800
Automatic...

310
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,040
Press a button, and it goes.
Press a button, and it stops.

311
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
The boys keep asking me...

312
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,840
"Dad, what do you do
all alone out at sea?"

313
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,200
They're concerned.
Concerned that I might die.

314
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,600
- I'm sick of people.
- You don't say.

315
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,400
What?

316
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,520
You used to want people around
all the time. Didn't you?

317
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,360
You would ask us to picnic on weekends.
You wouldn't let it go.

318
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,520
I did. It's been so long.

319
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm so old now, Agah.

320
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,240
I learned only one thing in this life.

321
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,520
You know what that is?

322
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,600
Keep away from people.

323
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,080
Yeah? Why?

324
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,480
Either they'll hurt you,
or you'll hurt them.

325
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,720
Two people coming together
is like smashing two eggs together.

326
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,080
One of them is bound to get smashed.

327
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,040
You know why
I wanted to talk to you today, Agah?

328
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,360
- You know the killer?
- What killer?

329
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,160
The one who killed Tayfun.

330
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,800
He shot lots of people
around here, as well.

331
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,000
I overheard them talking at the funeral.

332
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,560
That's when I was reminded of it.
That's also when I ran into you.

333
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,440
You worked at courthouses for years.
You must still have some connections.

334
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,520
People with priors.
Ex-prisoners. I thought maybe...

335
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,080
Maybe what, Taci?

336
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Could you find me a killer, Agah?

337
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,560
Excuse me?

338
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
A killer.

339
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,760
A killer.

340
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,760
For you.

341
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
What do you mean, they gathered up
the women? What does she want?

342
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,360
She's supposedly going to find
the girl that Tayyar raped.

343
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,240
Oh God!

344
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,760
Alright, you hold tight.
I'll think of something.

345
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,440
Are they gone now? Nevra and the others?

346
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,520
They're gone.
They stopped by the burnt-down house.

347
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,480
Took some more photos.

348
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,400
What are they looking for at that house?

349
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Vural...

350
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,560
Tear it down.

351
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,280
Get a bulldozer today.
Tear the house down.

352
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,080
<i>Bury the rubble</i>.

353
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,000
I don't want them
getting anything out of that house.

354
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,200
Level the place. You got that?

355
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,960
Of course.

356
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,600
Forgive me, Zuhal.

357
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,280
They come to me
with the most ridiculous questions.

358
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,320
You know how I feel sometimes?

359
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,240
As though they loaded
the whole world on my back,

360
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,160
and they keep telling me to get a move on.

361
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Throw off your burden, then.
Throw it off and be free.

362
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,120
How am I supposed to do that?
I live in that world also.

363
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,920
Fine. Leave some of it for me, then.
Let me carry some of it.

364
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,440
You're already carrying me.
That's more than enough.

365
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,920
I get it now.

366
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
You get what?

367
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Why my dad loves you so much.

368
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,200
So?

369
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,280
You're going to die, huh?

370
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm going to die, alright...

371
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,120
But it's proving to be very painful.

372
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,440
It's a prick of an illness.

373
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,320
It's seen predominantly in Turkish people.

374
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,200
I wonder why.

375
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,360
There are these pockets of air
in the lungs.

376
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,120
Little stones form inside them.
Like grains of sand.

377
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,120
What's it called?

378
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Alveolar Microlithiasis.

379
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,840
I see.

380
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,600
It's seen in Turkish people,
but the name's not in Turkish.

381
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,600
Yes. Well...

382
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,360
That's why, Agah... I want to die.

383
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
I can't take it anymore.

384
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
I have my wits about me still.

385
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
My arms and legs still work.
I want to go while I still have all that.

386
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,880
I can't kill myself.

387
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,040
I tried. I tried time and again.

388
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,320
But life grabs you so tightly
that it's impossible to get free.

389
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,480
Life... Wraps itself around your neck.

390
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
I'd like someone to come...

391
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,880
Put a bullet in my spine, and set me free.

392
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,160
You're right...

393
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,520
I always loved this side of yours.

394
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,200
You used to say that if you studied law,
you would want to become

395
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,840
neither prosecutor, nor judge, nor lawyer.

396
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,880
- I'd like to become a notary.
- Yes!

397
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,000
Being a notary is perfect for you.

398
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,120
This is what being a notary is like.
A notary doesn't ask questions.

399
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,680
He doesn't judge you...

400
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,680
He bears witness, puts down his seal,
then turns around and leaves.

401
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,760
So, Agah?

402
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,080
Is there someone who'd kill me?
Could you find me someone?

403
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
How are you doing?

404
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
You can imagine.

405
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Any news?

406
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,720
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

407
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
Not one fucking change.

408
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,720
They made a mistake with the list.

409
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,840
The heart was compatible
with someone else.

410
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,960
Alright. Fine.

411
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,440
How's the little Sefa doing?

412
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,760
As you can see. He's tired. Sleeping.

413
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,640
I didn't want to wake him up.

414
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,680
Good. Good.

415
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,320
- It was so funny the other day.
- What was?

416
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,000
The boys at the station
were having a ball.

417
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,720
Come on, not you!

418
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,440
What do you mean, "around 5.11 in height"?

419
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,400
Not 6 feet. 5.11.

420
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,600
I could tell from your voice.

421
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,080
You were in a panic
for letting him get a way.

422
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,760
How could I not be?
It happened again after all these years.

423
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,120
It says 5.11 in his report.

424
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:46,240
Not around 5.11, 5.11 exactly.

425
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,160
But I was more concerned
about your situation.

426
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,800
"I let him get away again," I thought.
"There has to be someone helping him."

427
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,080
Another gunfight will break out.
Shots will be fired yet again.

428
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,320
I was terrified.

429
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,880
- I sometimes wish you'd left me there.
- Stop talking nonsense.

430
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
I'm serious.

431
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,280
I wish you'd leave me there
so I could fucking die.

432
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,360
You jumped into the fray.

433
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,240
I was out of bullets.
They were about to put one in my head.

434
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,200
You arrived just like Superman.

435
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,360
You should have asked.

436
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
"Do you want to live?"

437
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,400
"Should I save your life?"

438
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,600
- Like my life's worth anything.
- Of course it is.

439
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,480
You got married.

440
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,320
Had a beautiful boy.
He's in there as we speak.

441
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,160
Gave him Sefa as a name. My boy.

442
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,800
Then your wife couldn't stand you
and ran away.

443
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,040
And you started hating all women.

444
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,680
Your life was fucked.
What else could you ask for?

445
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,360
- As though yours wasn't.
- We're talking about you for now.

446
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Don't you have
a home or something? Go home.

447
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,040
I do.

448
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,400
I do have a home,
but there's no one in it.

449
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,200
You took that one girl home.

450
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,800
We did it on the floor. It doesn't count.

451
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,040
Esin?

452
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,360
What is it, Vural?

453
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,360
- Blown tyre again?
- No, it's not that.

454
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,480
I was told you were given
something for safekeeping.

455
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
Safekeeping?

456
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
You know how they're tearing
the house down?

457
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
You took something from the house.
What did you take?

458
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Have you completely lost it?
Is that why you came all the way here?

459
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,160
Nothing will come out of that house.

460
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,160
It's all headed underground.

461
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,880
Who says?

462
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,000
Cemil?

463
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Tell hi to Cemil for me.

464
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,040
Give back what you took
and we'll throw it out for you.

465
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,360
Sadi? What are you doing, son?

466
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,920
I'll tell your mom! Give it back!

467
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,160
- Come on, don't make this any harder.
- Vural, stop snooping!

468
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,680
- Stop going through my stuff!
- Give back whatever it is you took.

469
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,200
You're making a big mistake.
Get out of my car!

470
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,240
Auntie, what are you doing?
Auntie! Auntie!

471
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,560
Auntie, what are you doing?

472
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
I told you,
you were making a big mistake.

473
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
You're going to break my neck!

474
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,600
You'll be just fine. What did I tell you?

475
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
- I told you to get lost!
- Take it down. I'm begging you!

476
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
Do you think we're children?
Do you think this is all a game?

477
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,560
- I'm asking you nicely.
- You can stop asking.

478
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,680
Let's start moving.

479
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,520
- Auntie! Let me go!
- You're strangling me!

480
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,000
- Auntie, let me go!
- Auntie, let us go! I'm begging you!

481
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,680
Bastards!

482
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,640
Now get the fuck out of my face.

483
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,120
You'll pay for that, Nesrin.
You'll pay for that!

484
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
Move, you idiot!

485
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,840
That's what you get, little shits!

486
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,280
I must've dozed off, Nesrin.

487
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,400
They're tearing down the house
you threw a stone at.

488
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,920
They're leveling it.

489
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,240
It'll all be gone by tomorrow.

490
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,760
But...

491
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Everyone will forget about it anyway.

492
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,000
I wanted you to know.

493
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,800
If, after all these years,

494
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,360
your conscience is plaguing you
for throwing that stone...

495
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,160
I went there...

496
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,840
And I brought you that stone
so that your pain isn't for naught.

497
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,960
Sleep well.

498
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,360
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

499
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,680
- What brings you here?
- I just felt like it.

500
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,240
Welcome, then.

501
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,680
Welcome, but what's wrong with you?

502
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,760
What's right with me, Timur?

503
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,960
A psycho killer is out on the loose...

504
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,160
And here I am enjoying myself,
having raki with you.

505
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,640
- Let's enjoy ourselves, then.
- Let's.

506
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,360
Do you still think about Nevra?

507
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,280
No.

508
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,160
It's over.

509
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,520
- Sure. If you say so.
- It is.

510
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,520
It was a childish fantasy.
It's over. I mean...

511
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,320
I was kidding myself.

512
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,640
I thought there was something,
but it was a mistake.

513
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,440
Officer Nevra's world
has no place in it for me.

514
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,560
Plus, look what happened.
Look who she's with now.

515
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,600
So what? Was your crazy Ceyda any better?

516
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,680
Getting a divorce from her
wasn't fun, was it?

517
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,080
You're right.

518
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,240
Never mind all that.
How are the kids doing?

519
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Good. They're doing good.

520
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,400
They start running away
whenever they see me. But they're good.

521
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,720
Timur...

522
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,640
- I'm going to give my resignation.
- What are you talking about?

523
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,120
If I can't catch this guy,
I shouldn't be in this line of business.

524
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,160
If I can't catch him,
they'll take her away anyway.

525
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Thanks.

526
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,040
I couldn't bear that.

527
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,880
Tolga... Let me to tell you something.

528
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,440
You remember when you told me

529
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,480
that Nevra wanted to give
her resignation but you refused?

530
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,920
I'm refusing yours, brother.

531
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,320
I'm refusing your letter of resignation.

532
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,240
You're going to find that bastard.

533
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,560
And then,
you're going to put him behind bars.

534
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,720
- You got that?
- Got it, Chief.

535
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,160
You know what I want to do?
I want to go on a vacation with you.

536
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,640
Just for two-three days.
What do you say?

537
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,600
I don't know.
There's Zuhal and Deva. Things come up.

538
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,440
They can take care of themselves.
What do you say? Let's go.

539
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,400
I don't know.

540
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
- There's nothing to know.
- Can I ask you something?

541
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,160
You know how you told me your husband...

542
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,920
That your departed husband
was in an accident?

543
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,880
Can we not talk about that right now?

544
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,120
I just want to ask something.

545
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,800
You can ask if you promise
to come on a vacation with me.

546
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Alright.

547
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,520
You know how he caused the accident
because he wanted to die?

548
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,440
What do you think would happen
if he'd failed

549
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,240
to kill himself
with that accident?

550
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,320
I can answer that right away.
He'd die again and again every day.

551
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
Every day for the rest of his life.

552
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,560
I see.

553
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,760
I see.

554
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,800
Why do you ask?

555
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,040
I made a decision today.

556
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,680
I was wondering if I made the right one.

557
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,080
That's why I asked.

558
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,400
- What was this decision?
- I want to tell you something.

559
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,800
And the only one
I've shared it with so far is my cat.

560
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,000
Now I'm sharing it with you.

561
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,400
I'm really scared of death.

562
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,240
- Everyone is.
- Sure. I know that.

563
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,960
Today, I decided
what to do with that fear.

564
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,360
I told you I was at a funeral today.

565
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,920
I kicked a ball around with some kids
in the courtyard of the mosque.

566
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,040
Something happened then.

567
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,560
I felt something.

568
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,280
I said to myself: "Agah,
don't be scared of being afraid."

569
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,400
"Instead of fearing death
and dying every day,

570
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,920
fear death, sure, but live every day."

571
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
How's that?

572
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

573
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,760
To health.

574
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,760
Drop the phone please.

575
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,320
You've been staring at it
since you walked in.

576
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,080
Nobody called.

577
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,640
What did you expect?
She's kept quiet for ten years.

578
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,880
Would she break her silence
because you came along?

579
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,120
Give it some time. Be patient.

580
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,240
Think how hard it must be for her.

581
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,520
You're right.

582
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,480
You're right. What are you doing?

583
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,400
Creating a media empire for myself.

584
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm starting a Youtube channel.

585
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,760
- Unknown caller.
- Answer it. Go on, answer it.

586
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Hello?

587
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,680
Hello?

588
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,840
Yes, this is her. I don't...

589
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,200
Miss, please calm down.
Please stop shouting. I'm listening.

590
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,600
What?

591
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,120
Can you tell me who did it?

592
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Alright.

593
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,320
Can we meet? It will...

594
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,440
It will take me some time
to drive to Kambura from Istanbul.

595
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,640
Is that so?

596
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
Alright.

597
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,160
Yes. Alright. I'm on my way.

598
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,440
She talked about a rape.

599
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,760
Tayyar Kaymak.

600
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,960
- I'm going.
- You're going now?

601
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,640
Where is she?

602
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,680
- Have you been waiting long?
- It's alright, it's just that...

603
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
The station was really crowded.

604
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,760
So many buildings.
All on top of each other.

605
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,520
How do you live here?

606
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,720
It's pretty hard, to be honest.

607
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,800
Yeliz...

608
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,680
- Can I call you Yeliz?
- Yes, yes, of course.

609
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,120
- You can call me Nevra.
- Alright.

610
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,520
Were you already going to come here?
Do you have relatives here or something?

611
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,920
No. When I told him
I was going to talk to you,

612
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,000
my husband kicked me out of the house.

613
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,440
I see.

614
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,200
- Do you have children?
- No. We couldn't have children.

615
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,760
Alright. Here's what we're going to do.

616
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,200
Come in.

617
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
This way.

618
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,120
- May I?
- Go on. Make yourself at home.

619
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,800
You can stay here for the night.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

620
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,480
Go on. Make yourself at home.

621
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,680
- Hello?
- Hello?

622
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,880
Hello? Nevra? I was worried.
You weren't answering your phone.

623
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,920
We just got home.

624
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,320
<i>She's staying at my place for the night</i>.

625
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,680
She doesn't have anyone to turn to.

626
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,920
Sure. Alright, we can talk later.

627
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,000
It's not very comfortable,
but it's better than nothing.

628
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,080
It's no trouble at all. Thank you.

629
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,560
Nevra...

630
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,960
I didn't know anything.
I was completely unaware.

631
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,200
I don't get it. Unaware of what?

632
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,240
Ufuk didn't tell me anything.

633
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,880
He didn't tell me
he was going to burn the house down.

634
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,800
He never used to talk, anyway.
He was strange. He kept to himself.

635
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,520
He got much stranger after the fire.

636
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:30,400
How could I have known
he would've burned that house down?

637
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,400
That the whole family inside
would perish in the fire?

638
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,040
- It was all my fault.
- Come on. Take a seat.

639
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,200
It's all my fault.

640
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,480
All those children died
because of me. I can't bear it.

641
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,320
Calm down. Please calm down.
Let's wipe your face.

642
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Calm down.

643
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,680
Can you tell me everything from the start?

644
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,080
I hadn't gotten married yet.

645
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,520
I was my father's dear girl.
He couldn't bear to see me get married.

646
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,520
- Is he still alive?
- No. He passed away.

647
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,640
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

648
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,280
I was on my way home from the grocer's.
He appeared out of nowhere. Tayyar.

649
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,720
He grabbed me by the arm.
Before I knew what was going on,

650
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,520
he took me aside
and put a knife against my throat.

651
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,360
Then he...

652
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,240
In the trees by my place...

653
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,600
- Did something like that happen again?
- Yes.

654
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,560
He told me that if I said
anything to anyone he'd humiliate me.

655
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,840
How could I tell anyone?
My father was sick.

656
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,760
And my mom?
What was I supposed to tell her?

657
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,000
- So you didn't tell anyone anything.
- No one.

658
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,600
How did Ufuk find out?

659
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,840
Tayyar brought Ufuk along one day.

660
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,720
Told me to bed him, as well.

661
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,240
Why would he do that?

662
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,080
He tricked Ufuk. Took his money.
Then told him about this girl.

663
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,520
He brought Ufuk along,
but he ran away when he saw me.

664
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,040
He couldn't stomach it.
When he realized that I was the girl...

665
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:34,160
He ran away. He loved me,
but I didn't know. That's why he ran.

666
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,440
I realized it too late.
The next day, he found me.

667
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,480
Told me not to worry,
that he'd handle everything.

668
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,800
I asked him what he meant.

669
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,360
Then, a week later or so...

670
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,080
Yes, it was a week later. One night...

671
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,880
There were these shouts.

672
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,000
Next thing we knew,

673
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,320
he'd burned the place down.

674
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,880
It was already too late.

675
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,440
After all that, Ufuk found me again.
Told me he'd handled it.

676
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,880
After that day,
he never spoke to me again.

677
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,920
I see.

678
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,320
Halis...

679
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
Did you know Halis?

680
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,000
Halis?

681
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,280
Fireman.

682
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,000
Oh, Halis.
Yes, I knew him. He passed.

683
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,360
He put it in his report
that a cigarette butt started the fire.

684
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,640
Why would he do that?
Why would he protect Ufuk?

685
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,640
Why would he hide
the fact that Ufuk started the fire?

686
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,680
There was this judge.

687
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,520
- Mehmet something?
- Mehmet Yurtgil.

688
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:49,000
- I don't know his surname.
- Mehmet Yurtgil.

689
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,640
He came and found me. Told me...

690
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,200
I wasn't to tell anyone anything.

691
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,240
He told me that
the family that died was Romani.

692
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,960
If it was heard that a Romani family
was burned alive in Kambura,

693
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,040
no one would care that
they were targeted because of me.

694
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,680
Everyone would assume that they were
targeted because of their ethnicity.

695
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,760
That's what he said.

696
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,520
Some people had forcibly kicked
a Romani family out of Kambura.

697
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,920
He didn't want Kambura to get a bad rap,

698
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,040
so he told me not to say anything.
So I said yes.

699
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,320
The judge must've spoken to Halis.
That's why he said it was a cigarette.

700
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,640
What else could he have done?
Kambura would've gotten a bad rap.

701
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,920
Alright.

702
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,800
You rest for now.
We can talk again in the morning. OK?

703
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,240
Sure. But I've told you everything.

704
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,080
What else is there to talk about?

705
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,480
I don't know anything else.

706
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,080
Good morning.

707
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,440
How are you feeling? Did you sleep well?

708
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,680
Yes. I slept alright.

709
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,760
Thanks.

710
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,640
Nevra, can you drop me off
at the station today?

711
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,080
Of course. Are you going back to Kambura?

712
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,440
No.

713
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,040
I'm not going back there again.

714
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,400
I'm going to go to Bursa.
I have relatives there.

715
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:00,760
I see.

716
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,840
Yeliz, I need to ask you something.

717
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,760
The things you told me last night...

718
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,880
There's nothing I can do
about them as a cop.

719
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,200
All the people you mentioned
are already dead.

720
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,200
I don't get it.

721
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,840
Why did you run from home?
Did you come here just to tell me this?

722
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,200
You know why?

723
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,040
I needed to get it off my chest so much.

724
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,640
I've kept quiet for years and years.

725
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,960
And after I got married? Forget about it.

726
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,800
My husband figured it out.

727
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,080
When it was time to have sex,
he checked and saw that I was a woman.

728
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,040
Well...

729
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,000
I thought he'd kick me out then.

730
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,120
I thought he'd leave me.
But he really loved me.

731
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:56,840
He loved me so much.
He told me not to explain.

732
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,360
"No matter what you did, don't tell me,
I don't want to know about it," he said.

733
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,640
So I kept quiet.

734
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,640
Then, when we couldn't have children,
it was his turn to keep quiet.

735
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,600
We kept quiet. Husband and wife.
Our whole lives.

736
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,880
Keeping a secret
makes you feel like you're in prison.

737
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,880
I wanted to get it off my chest.
I wanted to get it out of me.

738
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,320
I wanted to finally breathe and be free.

739
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,360
I hoped it might do some good.

740
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,160
But...

741
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,120
You say there's nothing you can do.

742
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,040
I'm sorry. I took so much of your time.

743
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,040
I've kept you off more urgent business.
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

744
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,040
Don't be silly. That's not what I meant.

745
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,800
I'm glad that you came.
I'm glad that you told me all that.

746
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,880
Thanks.

747
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,760
Thank you for listening to me.

748
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,200
- Have something to eat.
- Alright.

749
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,040
Well, how was our day?

750
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,520
Good. So you liked the tour.

751
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,440
Great. We'll do it again.
We certainly will. Don't worry.

752
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,520
Feza. Feza.

753
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,080
Feza. Feza?

754
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,000
We'll do it again...

755
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,560
We'll arrange good tours.

756
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,560
Everything was perfect...

757
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,280
I'm so glad to hear that.

758
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,960
Feza. Feza.

759
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,720
This way...

760
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:49,920
Call if you need anything, alright?

761
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,080
Sure. Of course.
Thank you so much.

762
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,880
You don't have to wait
for the bus to leave.

763
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,200
- Have a good journey.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

764
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,720
- Don't.
- You aren't checking it?

765
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,120
No.

766
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,960
I hate buses.
You should skip it, as well.

767
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,360
So, Feza... How about another journey?

768
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,880
How about another poem?

769
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,800
Hello?

770
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,040
Yes.

771
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,680
Yes.

772
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,040
Feza. Come on. We're here.

773
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,840
Come on.

774
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,000
It's right there.
Just a short walk away. Go on.

775
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,120
This way, Feza. This way.

776
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,760
Feza? This way.

777
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,760
This way, Feza.

778
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,560
We're almost there. After these stairs...

779
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,880
We'll turn left, and then...

780
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:11,160
Feza, forgive me.
I know it was quite a walk.

781
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:15,360
But the elevator's always broken.

782
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,560
Always broken. I don't know why.

783
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,040
Why won't it go in?

784
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,920
They won't be home.

785
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,600
The kids are both out.
Don't ring the bell.

786
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,560
Don't ring the bell.
There's nobody home.

787
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,680
Feza, there's nobody home.
Stop ringing the bell. That's enough.

788
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,760
Yes?

789
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,720
Nezaket?

790
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,360
It's Agah.

791
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,160
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

792
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,320
Agah.

793
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,400
Do you remember me?

794
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:14,760
I used to live here with my wife, Mebrure.

795
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,760
You were our landlord. Agah Beyoglu.

796
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,240
Agah Beyoglu.

797
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,640
Agah!

798
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,800
Come on in. Come in.

799
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,440
So, Agah...
You wanted to see your old home?

800
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,400
I understand. It must be full of memories.

801
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,200
We used to live upstairs, as you know.

802
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,720
When Fikri died,
I took a good look around.

803
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:47,720
Living on my own in a huge apartment
wasn't going to work out.

804
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,560
So I came down here.

805
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,760
Tell you what.

806
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,840
Do you remember Iclal? My daughter?

807
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,080
She got married and moved to Ankara.

808
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,840
She never calls me anymore.

809
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,600
Why would someone
neglect their own mother so much?

810
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,080
Here's how it goes.

811
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,360
I call her, she yawns
and yawns on the other end.

812
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,520
When I ask what's wrong,
she tells me she's getting sleepy.

813
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,480
It baffles me.

814
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,920
When she was a little girl...

815
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:28,880
I'd swing her for hours,
but she wouldn't get a wink of sleep.

816
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:35,680
Now, whenever I call to talk,
she yawns and yawns.

817
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,400
When I ask what's wrong,
she tells me she's getting sleepy.

818
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,640
So I stopped calling.
What else was I supposed to do?

819
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,240
I had to accept it.

820
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,680
So?

821
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,360
Where do you live now, Agah?

822
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,440
Where do you live?

823
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,880
- That's what I'm trying to remember.
- What's that supposed to mean?

824
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,240
Don't you know where you live?
Where your home is?

825
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,600
- What's Mebrure saying?
- That's not Mebrure.

826
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,320
- Excuse me?
- That's not Mebrure!

827
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,240
I'm asking myself a different question.
Why did I come here?

828
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,160
Might I have come here to kill you?

829
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,760
What are you saying?
I can't hear you. Speak louder.

830
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,200
Nezaket, have you ever been to Kambura?

831
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,600
- What?
- Kambura!

832
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,400
Have you ever been to Kambura?

833
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,320
You're losing it.

834
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,760
Get off it!

835
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,040
DOG SLAYER
