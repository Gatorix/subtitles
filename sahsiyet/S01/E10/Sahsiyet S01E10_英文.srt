1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,400
Remember the "Personality".

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,040
No murder, O.K?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,320
Let's pray.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,160
- Dad?
- Zuhal?

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,000
- Did you know Mr.Tayfun?
- Of Course I did.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,880
All the way from Kambura.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,600
Sorry for your loss.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,560
Be brave son.
You can't escape fate.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,840
What fate?
They blew up the flower man.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,400
As founders of the "Dog Killer" Fan Club
we officially welcome you.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
If you don't make an arrest
within a week, it's over.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,840
The girl whom Tayyar raped...

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,960
she is talking to me.
Look what she's saying.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,680
Help me Nevra.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,200
Up until now,
I have been her voice.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,600
All these murders are
for her revenge.

17
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,520
If we find her
we find this one too.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,840
We have to go to
Kambura immediately.

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,440
Ladies, anyone who was
raped or sexually abused...

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,160
please call this number.

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,880
What do you mean by
"they gathered the women"?

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,520
She is trying to find the girl
who was raped by Tayyar.

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,120
O.K, just stand by.
I'll think of something.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,960
They checked out
the burned house.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,840
Find a bulldozer immediately.

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,480
And knock it down.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,800
- I don't recognize the number.
- Go on, answer it.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,120
Hello?

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,200
Just tell me everything
from the beginning.

30
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,680
It was an ordinary day. I had just
finished my grocery shopping.

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
As I left the shop
Tayyar appeared out of nowhere.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,600
He grabbed me and...

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,560
you know, in the woods.

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
She remembers everything.

35
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,560
Just call me if
you need anything.

36
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Thank you very much.
You don't need to hang around.

37
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,240
Firuz...

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,760
the less you know, the better
you can sleep at night.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,240
Then you won't
have to call me...

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,080
or say "leave me alone".

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Do you think Nevra
was convinced?

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Absolutely.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,600
She was about to start crying,
thanks to my story-telling skill.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,960
By the way, I talked to Cemil.
He said you have the rest of my money.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,480
Yes, that's right.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,400
- S..it!
- What is it?

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,120
So much for been convinced.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,760
She is following us.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,720
- Where?
- Don't turn around.

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,440
What are we going to do now?

51
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
S..it!

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,120
What am I going to do now?

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
What now?

54
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Think. Where is your home?

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,600
Think, think, think.

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
Where is your house?

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,760
No, it's not going to work.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,360
Mrs Feza!

59
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Let's go.

60
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
Come on, get up. Let's go.

61
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Get up. I don't know where
but we should go.

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Here you go.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,560
My bag...

64
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,120
anything else?

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,360
O.K, this way Mrs Feza.
Here you go.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,440
Is she still following you?

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Keep going Firuz.

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,800
Don't get out the car
until I think of something, O.K?

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Mrs Feza!

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,400
I've read thousands of novels and
I decided to write one myself.

71
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,040
And you two f..cked it up.

72
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Listen to me now.
I am listening Mr.Cemil.

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,680
- Can you hear me Yeliz?
- Yes, I can.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,600
I made some calls.
We'll change the story a little.

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
What I'm about to say,
get it into your heads.

76
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,480
Smallest mistake,
you're done with.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
Hello?

78
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,640
Are you serious?

79
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Yeliz met with Firuz?
There must be a mistake.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,520
No mistake.
They are right ahead of me.

81
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,360
It is obvious that they know each other.
He is driving her somewhere.

82
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,080
O.K. Hang on a minute.
Just calm down.

83
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you mean Yeliz was
bulls... tting you last night?

84
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
And now, she is with Firuz, right?

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes, that's exactly so.

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,880
I have to talk to Firuz to find out
what's been happening.

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Just hang up.

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,560
Don't call him now Sefer.
I have to see where they are headed.

89
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,480
Listen to me.
No one knows Firuz better than I do.

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
If there is something iffy going on,
either he won't answer...

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,800
or give me a lot of crap.

92
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,640
I have to call Firuz to find out.

93
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,960
- Hang on a minute.
- What?

94
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,760
Are you going to tell him that
I've been following him?

95
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
If I know Firuz well enough, he already
figured out that he's being followed.

96
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,800
No, it is not here either.

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,840
I made a note of everything.

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,040
Even, chucking the TV set out.
But no address.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
I am so stupid.

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,680
Poor Agah.

101
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Not in the wallet either.

102
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,960
But it should be
on the car's log book.

103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,400
Yes, it should be
on the log book.

104
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,040
Calm down Agah.

105
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,800
Take a deep breath.

106
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Thank you.

107
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,560
Take a deep breath.

108
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,920
Mrs. Feza, I don't remember
where I live.

109
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,960
I don't remember my home.

110
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
What the hell is going on?

111
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,280
Keep doing whatever
you've been doing.

112
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,000
Excuse me?

113
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,960
Keep following me.
I called Sefa. He is on his way.

114
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,040
We have to sit down and talk.

115
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Everything should be here.

116
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,680
I make a note of everything
in this black book.

117
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,040
It says here "Combination for the
Flat No 8 is 1682".

118
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,320
But what is Flat No:8?

119
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
Where the hell is it?
How the hell do I know?

120
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Why didn't I write down
the address instead of the combination?

121
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Such an idiot!

122
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,640
Unfortunately, this is the situation
we are in right now.

123
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,600
I don't remember.

124
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,080
There must be a reason
why I forgot.

125
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,560
I'll take you to seaside.

126
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
I can play flamenco for you.

127
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,680
- Olé!
- Yes, sure, Olé.

128
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,880
Remember when you asked me
how the idea came up?

129
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,160
When you said why should others
decide who is to be killed?

130
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,440
Do you know why?

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,600
Because they've always been
the ones to decide.

132
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,960
Come over here.

133
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,960
Gerome painted this in 1872.

134
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
What are those people doing?

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
That's what the painting is called.
"Pollice Verso".

136
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,720
It means "thumbs down".

137
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,120
And who is it for?

138
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,480
For the gladiator.

139
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Why? So he can kill this man.

140
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,536
Actually, it is not clear which one means
"death" in ancient Rome.

141
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,120
This, or this.

142
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,720
But Gerome thought
this was the fitting one.

143
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,040
If you do this,
the gladiator will kill.

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,160
And there would be
death in the Arena.

145
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,160
If you do this
you save the man's life.

146
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,200
But one is not enough.
The decision has to be unanimous.

147
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,640
What I mean is, who will die or live
has to be decided unanimously.

148
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,680
Unanimous decisions are always
deemed legitimate.

149
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,840
It will take the
guilty conscience away.

150
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,360
At the end of the day,
you are inciting to a murder.

151
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
It is a crime.

152
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,040
But this way, everybody can point
the finger at each other.

153
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,880
And the crime disappears.

154
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
What this painting tells us that...

155
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
if you want to commit a crime
and not get blamed...

156
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,880
all you have to do is to
build a crowd around you.

157
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,960
It is no longer a crime, if you commit it
with a large enough crowd.

158
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,680
And...

159
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,720
do these remind you anything?

160
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,040
Well...

161
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
you upload a video on YouTube.

162
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,720
What happens is that it is judged by
people you don't even know.

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
Like...

164
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
and dislike.

165
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
Life...

166
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,800
or death.

167
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,200
As you can see, nothing has changed
in 2 thousand years Süveyda.

168
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Only difference is that
you can't do this anymore.

169
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,040
You have to click on the icons.

170
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,080
I thought of it
when I saw the painting.

171
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,080
We have the gladiator, so let the
crowd decide who'll die.

172
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
- Did you hear it?
- What?

173
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,760
The three man who were killed?

174
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,680
The ones with the word "personal"
carved on their forehead?

175
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,920
They were on the list
in our website.

176
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,320
- Are you serious?
- Why don't you check it out?

177
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,800
Switch on the computer Süveyda.

178
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,920
I found out at school.
They just told me.

179
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,320
One of them was running
a food kiosk or something.

180
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,640
He says "they are extorting money from
me. I hope the "Dog Killer" kill them all".

181
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,440
They issued the names too.
Only a day before the murders.

182
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,680
And people went wild.
Everybody is loading names on the list.

183
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
You know what this means
don't you?

184
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,040
"Dog Killer" is following
our website.

185
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,960
Alright then. What were you doing
there? How do you know this woman?

186
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,760
No rush. There is a time for everything.
Wait till Sefa gets here.

187
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Here he is.

188
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,120
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

189
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,960
Put it this way, I have to do
the s... itty work...

190
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,840
because you have been
so f..cking useless.

191
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,960
- What are you talking about?
- Murders are piling up every day.

192
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,160
And your brains are messed up
with Kambura.

193
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,560
We are not getting anywhere.

194
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,080
They are going mad in Ankara.
And I have to take all the s... it.

195
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,080
Remember coming to the hospital
yesterday?

196
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,336
They called me straight after
you left.

197
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,000
- Who are "they"?
- Ones at the top in Ankara.

198
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,040
They said "there is something iffy
going on over there. Dig into it".

199
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,440
I said "you want me to investigate
my partners"?

200
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,960
They said "exactly".

201
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,520
Yes sir.

202
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,680
- Does boss know about it?
- They probably told him.

203
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,880
I'll go and talk to him anyway.

204
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,680
I have been a superintendent for years.
I am not going to spy on my team.

205
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,040
They told Chief Tolga,
gave him a week.

206
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
If he can't solve it
they'll show him the door.

207
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes sir, I understand sir.

208
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,040
Yes, you've told me sir.

209
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
But I think it is unnecessary.

210
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
No.

211
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Because I trust my team sir.

212
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
O.K.

213
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,280
I understand.

214
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,720
So, what is it?
Do they suspect us?

215
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Thanks.

216
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,040
Don't pretend that
you don't already know Sefa.

217
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,560
They are just pulling
the wool over eyes.

218
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,360
They will want to justify their action
when the case blows bigger...

219
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,720
in couple of days.

220
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,000
They'll say
"we investigated the cops."

221
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,960
Everybody is trying to
save their own a..ss.

222
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,000
It is all about saving your skin.

223
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
That's what it is.

224
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Nothing beats the seaside.

225
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,160
Nothing can beat it.

226
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,360
It must've been 50 years
since I last flew a kite.

227
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
50 years at least.

228
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,800
I have to run to fly it.
But how can I run?

229
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,120
I'll be back in a minute.
Wait here.

230
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,680
Let me ask you something?

231
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,200
How did you figure it out?

232
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,680
I mean, how did you figure out that
I was going to meet the woman?

233
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,736
I didn't figure out that
you were going to meet.

234
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,640
I only figured out that
she was lying.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,360
But everything she told me
made sense.

236
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,840
That's right, it all made sense.

237
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,840
Except one thing.

238
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,560
No man in Kambura
would marry a non-virgin.

239
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,040
It doesn't matter
how much he loves her.

240
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,320
It is against Kambura's customs.

241
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,200
That's why, the woman in question
either never got raped nor she is married.

242
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,696
But since we knew she was married,
I decided to follow her...

243
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,200
to find out where she was going and
who was forcing her to lie.

244
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,080
That's when you
came into the scene.

245
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,760
You're doing good.

246
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,360
May be not so good.

247
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
But you'll do it.

248
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,600
- I can't do it.
- You can do it.

249
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
I'll tell you what,
let's try 10 more times and...

250
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,760
we'll quit if it doesn't
work out.

251
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Go on. This is the first.
We start with the first one.

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Mrs. Feza.

253
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Mrs. Feza.

254
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Come on.

255
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,920
It's O.K.

256
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,560
Let's go for the second.

257
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,520
Come on son.

258
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Well done.

259
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
No, this way.

260
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Faster.

261
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,120
Three.

262
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,560
For the forth time.

263
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,840
Lie? Why should I lie to you?

264
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,200
If you don't believe me
ask my husband.

265
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,800
Ask him if I was virgin
when we got married.

266
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,120
It's O.K Nevra.

267
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,680
That's enough. We'll drop you off
wherever you want to go.

268
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
What sort of a woman are you,
making me talk about such things?

269
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,920
How can you do this to your own kind?
Have you got no feelings?

270
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,040
What did your mum used to
say to you Yeliz?

271
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,760
What do you mean? What's that
got to do with anything?

272
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,641
What did your mum used to
say to you when you were little?

273
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,640
How was she threatening you?

274
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Wasn't she saying "do you want to
become a whore"?

275
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,080
"You'll end up becoming
a whore".

276
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Isn't that what she was saying?

277
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,560
What's that got to do
with anything?

278
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,840
That's what she used say,
wasn't it?

279
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,640
Do you know why? Because your mum
knew exactly what Kambura was like.

280
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,600
You know too.

281
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,200
If you are looking for a wrong doing,
it is the Kambura itself.

282
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,440
Look mister, it is flying.

283
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,880
It may even be so that...

284
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,760
you're telling the truth Yeliz.

285
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,160
You really have been raped.

286
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,520
Yes, why not?

287
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,920
Yesterday you were talking about
everything in detail.

288
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,280
But you avoided the subject of rape.
Why?

289
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,000
Because you couldn't do it.

290
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,720
You had the guts to lie to us.

291
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,320
But you never had the courage to tell
what happened to you.

292
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,600
You really have been raped Yeliz.

293
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
Mrs Feza, it is flying.

294
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,280
We finally did it. It's flying.

295
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Mrs Feza!

296
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
It's flying.

297
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,520
And then, you married
the man who raped you.

298
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Why? Because the place called Kambura
never left you with another choice.

299
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,360
That's what happened, isn't it?

300
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,520
Come on, say it.
Isn't that what happened?

301
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,480
That's enough Nevra.
Leave the girl alone.

302
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,440
Because you've got
nothing to say.

303
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,040
It means that it's not
Tayyar who did this to you.

304
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,960
He might've done it to somebody else,
but not to you.

305
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,920
But why are you lying,
blaming him?

306
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,880
Is that what you
want to believe?

307
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,800
Who do you think you're fooling?
Yourself or us?

308
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,096
Do you think your husband will get away
with it if you point the finger at Tayyar?

309
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,160
I'll tell you what, you can blame all
the men in the world...

310
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,320
but it doesn't clear off
your husband.

311
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,560
I am off to Kambura.
Are you coming?

312
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,120
Sure I am.

313
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,440
You can tag along too,
since your job is to spy on us.

314
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
Don't bother, we'll meet
you there.

315
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,120
It got stuck.

316
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
The kite got stuck.

317
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
Mrs Feza...

318
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,240
the kite...

319
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,880
Mrs Feza!

320
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
The kite got stuck.

321
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,080
Poor Agah.

322
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,920
That's exactly what you'll become.

323
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,520
Never mind.

324
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,120
- Hello Ateş.
- Nevra, where are you?

325
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
I am off to Kambura.

326
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,680
I was about to ask you
to come to Kambura.

327
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,080
Is that where you are?

328
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,320
I discovered this place
when I first came to Istanbul.

329
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,120
When I was a student.

330
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,000
I became a regular customer.

331
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Do you like it? Nice isn't it?

332
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,080
Yes, it is nice but...

333
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,160
how about the guys?

334
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,440
They are on duty.

335
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,120
I don't like going around
in herds either.

336
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,960
But I am being stalked
by a psychopath. You saw it.

337
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,920
You even saw him better than me.

338
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,440
What am I supposed to do?

339
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,920
Change your routine
until they arrest the man.

340
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,480
I had a routine until that man began
messing with my life.

341
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,920
If you ask me
what paradise is like...

342
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,560
I'd say "it is a place where
every day is the same".

343
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,920
Where nothing changes,
including me...

344
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,680
a place where everything
runs smooth.

345
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,560
As a matter of fact, I built such a place
and lived there.

346
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,040
Now, there is a devil
in my paradise.

347
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,080
Do you want me to close down my
paradise because of him?

348
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,080
And now, there is an
angel there too.

349
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,360
In this case...

350
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,760
Mr Cemil...

351
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,760
is it coincidence that the devil and the
angel made their way into your...

352
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,840
paradise simultaneously?

353
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,080
Or was it fate?

354
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,680
I don't know that much
but I must've left the door open...

355
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,200
allowing both the devil
and the angel in.

356
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,840
This is not the place.

357
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,840
Why did I come here?

358
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,080
This is the place...

359
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,480
where an old friend used to live.
His name is Nazif.

360
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,560
Now he calls himself "Naz".

361
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,800
It's O.K I suppose.
No harm in it.

362
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,720
I once did something here.

363
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,240
They say the killer always
returns to the scene of murder.

364
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,560
So did I.

365
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,280
I was supposed to forget about it.

366
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,440
Wait a minute, your daughter
is not here, is she?

367
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,720
We can go to your place.
There are no cameras there.

368
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,640
The house is empty.

369
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,800
I can play flamenco for you.

370
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,680
Olé!

371
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,280
Yes, sure. Olé.

372
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,960
- How did you find out?
- I wanted to see the place.

373
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,560
A man hung himself,
causing havoc in the town.

374
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,400
I came to check it out.
And this is the situation.

375
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,360
As you can see, the place
has gone back in time.

376
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,480
There is nothing left. They covered it
with earth, buried it completely.

377
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,000
I wonder who did it?

378
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,960
I found out that too.

379
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,400
Havran Holding.

380
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,320
They bought the land from a farmer
two years ago.

381
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,200
Havran Holding.

382
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,040
They have foundations,
granting scholarship to children.

383
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,200
Cemil Havran is the CEO.

384
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,400
And he is from Kambura.

385
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
Cemil.

386
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,520
Yes, we will build a hospital there.
What is your name please?

387
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Nevra Elmas.

388
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
Mrs Nesrin's daughter.

389
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
Of course I know her.

390
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,360
Where from? Kambura of course.

391
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,080
Do you have any more
questions Miss Nevra?

392
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Yes, I have.

393
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,200
What made you knock this building
down after all these years?

394
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,760
Especially right after...
Yes. Right after a sad incident.

395
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,560
And I knew Ufuk very well.

396
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,440
Sad.

397
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,160
May he rest in peace.

398
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,640
Look Miss Nevra, you can be called a
native of Kambura.

399
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,440
Kambura is a significant
place for me.

400
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,480
A life has vanished there.

401
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,840
We decided to do something that would
pave way for other lives to flourish.

402
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,360
Do you understand?

403
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,240
That's why we decided
to build a hospital.

404
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,040
I tell you what we can do...

405
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,080
make an appointment with me...

406
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,560
we sit down and a have nice chat
over a nice cup of coffee.

407
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,720
By the way, this is
my private number.

408
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,440
You're with the police force.

409
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,960
Therefore you had no problem of
obtaining my number.

410
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,320
But, don't call me on this
number again.

411
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,840
In fact, it is better
if you forget this number.

412
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,760
It is best if you delete it
from your contacts list.

413
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,000
But if it's too much trouble for you,
I get in touch with your bosses...

414
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,760
and they can do it for you.

415
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
Is it O.K?

416
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,320
Give my regards to your mother.

417
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,040
Stupid girl.

418
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,000
She's gone into all that trouble
to find your number...

419
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,520
to talk about this.

420
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,440
Let's not say "stupid"...

421
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,200
let's say "enthusiastic".

422
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,600
Young.

423
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,320
Never ran into a wall.

424
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,200
They broke it again.

425
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,200
They broke the lock Mrs Feza.

426
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,760
It is O.K now.

427
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,320
The locksmith had said that
they follow your moves.

428
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,760
They broke in when they realized that
the house was empty.

429
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,600
Isn't that right?

430
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,800
I checked the place. Not much damage.
I don't think they took anything.

431
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,040
The bedroom is a little messy.
But apart from that...!

432
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,280
There is supposed to be a fish there.
I wonder if it's still alive.

433
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,840
Did it have a name?

434
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,240
Did the fish have a name Mrs Feza?

435
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,200
What did you name it?

436
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,560
What would I name it
if it was me?

437
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,520
Agah?

438
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Yes?

439
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
You killed Mehmet.

440
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,240
They say Mrs Feza was kidnapped.

441
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,520
I reported it to the police.
They are looking for her.

442
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,560
I told them what happened
to her husband.

443
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,960
They say it probably
has nothing to do with it.

444
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,560
They know nothing.
Cops are useless.

445
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,760
Finally! I have been trying to get
hold of you since morning.

446
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,600
I know dad. I am sorry.
It's been such a hectic day.

447
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,240
I am still busy. But you can talk to me
if it's emergency.

448
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,640
Do you remember the judge,
Mehmet Yurtgil?

449
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,040
His wife Feza was staying here.
They kidnapped her.

450
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,640
Kidnapped? Who? When?

451
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
This morning, during the
stroll in the park.

452
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,640
They say she got lost.
But I am sure she was kidnapped...

453
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,200
by her husband's killer.

454
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,976
They reported it to the police.
But the police is not doing anything.

455
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,400
Why would they kidnap her?
She was very ill.

456
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,640
I think they kidnap her to
stop her telling the story.

457
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,800
She may reveal
what she witnessed to.

458
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,840
You can't trust human brain.
You can never know how it works.

459
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Would you take the risk
if you were the murderer?

460
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,040
Moreover, Mrs Feza had begun
to talk recently.

461
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,520
What was she saying?

462
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,600
She was reading poems?

463
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,360
I see.

464
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
To the space?

465
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,440
I've got it, dad.
I'll take care of it.

466
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,920
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

467
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
What's going on?
Who kidnapped who?

468
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,840
Feza Yurtgil,
Mehmet Yurtgil's wife.

469
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,040
She suffers from
Alzheimer's Disease.

470
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,560
She's gone missing in the park.

471
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,160
By the way, Nazım Hikmet travelled to
space but police didn't know about it.

472
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Let's go.

473
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,200
Unfortunately, we are closed
to the press.

474
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,720
He will find out anyway.

475
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,120
The anonymous tipper among us
will tell him everything.

476
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,600
Now or later,
what is the difference?

477
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,720
You are not the ones
who should be ashamed.

478
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,400
The ones who see you as an item
to be bought and sold...

479
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,200
they are the ones
who should be ashamed.

480
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,840
What did they teach us?

481
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,000
Complete the opposite.

482
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,480
You've got raped
because you've wagged your tail.

483
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,160
You got harassed on the street because
you revealed your body too much.

484
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,160
So many young girls walking
bent-over in Kambura...

485
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,120
to hide their breasts from men.

486
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Are you aware of it?

487
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,080
The hump on children's back...

488
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,400
is our fault.

489
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,520
Mebrule used to hold the cardigan
against my back to measure it.

490
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,600
I am taking over
from she left off.

491
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,640
I wish she was here so I could
knit something for her.

492
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,040
But it is too dark to see in here.

493
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,600
I am sorry Mrs Feza.
We are left in the dark.

494
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,400
But we had to do it to stop others
seeing what's going on inside.

495
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,000
The door can't be locked.

496
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,560
You can't even shut it properly,
let alone locking it.

497
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,680
Mr Münir used to hate
the doors too.

498
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
Mr Münir, my cat.

499
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,680
He hated closed doors.

500
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,160
He used to tap it with his paw,
asking me to open it.

501
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,960
But he was so exhausted
in his final days.

502
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,000
He was unable get up.

503
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,240
He was unable to get up
to even ask for water.

504
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,960
And I never realized.

505
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,360
So intriguing.

506
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,880
This...

507
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
look.

508
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,560
Guide to Documentation Sorting.

509
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
I have this book too.

510
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,160
This man.

511
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,560
His name is Tayyar Kaymak.

512
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,320
He raped a girl in Kambura sometime
between 10 and 15 years ago.

513
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,680
We don't know how old
she was at the time.

514
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
But she is an adult woman now.

515
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,240
Ladies, I am looking
for this woman.

516
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,440
Please come forward if you know
anything about this woman...

517
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,840
about this incident
or about Tayyar Kaymak.

518
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,320
Believe me, the smallest of information
you provide will save a life.

519
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,440
Please, come forward
if you know anything.

520
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Don't hide it.

521
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,160
Don't hide it, so the woman
wouldn't have to hide anymore.

522
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,240
The book has it all.

523
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,000
How to sort documentation.

524
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,400
There are many ways.

525
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,880
One of them is...

526
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,280
by numbering each letter.

527
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,440
For example 1 for A, 2 for B,
3 for C and so on.

528
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,040
And then...

529
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,400
yes, I always sort my documents
this way.

530
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,520
I never forgot.

531
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,360
When you see the number...

532
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,600
1682.

533
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,760
Mrs Feza, 1682.

534
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,560
1 is A.

535
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,400
No, it said "1682 is the combination
for the Flat No:8".

536
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,880
If there is No:8, 1682 refers
to something else.

537
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,840
So, it is not 1, It is 16.

538
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,000
If it's 16...

539
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
A, B, C, Ç, D, E...

540
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,440
M.

541
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
Mebrule.

542
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,360
You can call me
on this number anytime.

543
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,760
All I want is
to find that woman.

544
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,680
If someone did that to me,
ruining my dignity...

545
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,440
I would commit suicide.

546
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
What did you say?

547
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Yes, you.

548
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,000
I said nothing.

549
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Yes, you did. You said if it
happened to you...

550
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,000
I said I would commit suicide.
Wouldn't you?

551
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,880
A man rapes you
and you carry on living?

552
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Who can bear it?

553
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,800
How can you face
your loved ones?

554
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,520
How can you go back home,
to your family?

555
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,960
Mebrule Blocks.

556
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,200
I've got it Mrs Feza.
Mebrule Blocks.

557
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,560
Flat no: 8.
But what is the "2" at the end?

558
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,960
Mebrule Blocks, flat no: 8.

559
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,240
16, 8, 2, B.

560
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Beyoğlu.

561
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,960
Agah, Beyoğlu.

562
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,760
Mebrule Blocks, flat 8, Beyoğlu.
I've got it.

563
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,400
Mrs Feza, I found the house.

564
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,440
I found the address. Get up.

565
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,080
Get up, we are going home.

566
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,160
Mrs Feza, I've got it. Come on.

567
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,280
Let's go back to the station.
We'll check the archives.

568
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,280
To look for what?

569
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,400
Suicides committed
in the last 15 years...

570
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,560
and we'll go back 20 years
if necessary.

571
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,120
Because the girl
committed suicide.

572
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,240
The girl whom Tayyar
raped committed suicide.

573
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,640
That's why we can't find her.

574
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,720
Because she is no longer alive.

575
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
We've got the address.
How could I not remember it?

576
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,200
Just a minute, let me put the book
back in its place.

577
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
Yes.

578
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,320
Mrs Feza.

579
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
Flamenco?

580
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,000
- Olé.
- Sure, Olé.

581
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,320
Well, well, well...

582
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,080
the honourable D.A,
I can see you're having a good time.

583
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,760
I am sorry to interrupt
but we have to talk.

584
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,280
How did you know I was here?

585
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,680
How did I know?

586
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,200
I have as many informants
as officers in my team.

587
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,160
They tell me everything.

588
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,440
Where you go, what time
you finish work.

589
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,720
They tell me everything.

590
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,240
What do you want?

591
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,960
Now, the honourable D.A...

592
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,800
who has been messing
with my case and why?

593
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,080
This is number one.

594
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,840
And the number two...

595
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,360
who specifically reinstated the
man to the case...

596
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
whom I removed.

597
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,280
Who is running this case?
What's going on?

598
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,600
Look, a little advice from me...

599
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,040
do you know the secret
to move up in the ladder?

600
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,680
Not to ask questions.

601
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,600
F... ck the ladder.

602
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,560
I don't want to move up anywhere.
How about that?

603
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,560
Not moving up means
you are stuck where you are.

604
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,760
And that's where you'll be buried.

605
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,640
Are you threatening me?

606
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,600
No, just talking about a
simple rule of management.

607
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,880
Rule of management. I like that.

608
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,600
For a moment, I thought
you were threatening me.

609
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,000
Because I am allergic to it.
It gives me the itch.

610
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,840
When someone threatens me
I threaten them back.

611
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,640
Now, talking about threats...

612
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,080
does your beautiful and respected wife
know what you are up to here?

613
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,720
You are a good man Tolga.
You wouldn't do such a thing.

614
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,320
You haven't got the evil in you.

615
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,840
That's right.
I haven't got the evil.

616
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,560
But when I walk out that door
anything can happen.

617
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,960
You never know what a man
is capable of doing.

618
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,680
Mankind is an
unpredictable species.

619
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,480
I don't know
who gave the orders.

620
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,536
They called both from Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Ministry of Justice.

621
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,280
They told me what to do
and I agreed.

622
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,880
I swear, I don't know who is
pulling the strings.

623
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,560
You won't say anything
to anyone, will you?

624
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,120
Everybody has a soft belly.

625
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,240
Being lured by temptations
depends on the one's personality.

626
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,200
And that's your problem.
It has nothing to do with me.

627
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,800
Have fun.

628
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,040
You are great Mrs Feza.
You really are.

629
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
You were great.

630
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,520
Come on, let's not keep
the children waiting.

631
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,720
Shall we go now?

632
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,880
O.K, one more.

633
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,640
This is the last one.

634
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,640
Just a minute.
Let's do it properly.

635
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

636
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,200
greatest name of all times
of flamenco dance.

637
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,320
A unique talent...

638
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,400
Senora Feza.

639
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,280
[Cause of Death: Suicide.

640
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,800
Mrs Feza?

641
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,480
What happened?

642
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,400
What happened? Are you alright?

643
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,240
Can you hear me?

644
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,000
Mrs Feza?

645
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,120
Please, don't do this.

646
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,080
This can't be happening.

647
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,600
Please.

648
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,400
Can you hear me Mrs Feza?

649
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,880
Please, don't. Don't do this.

650
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,960
Please, no.

651
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,280
I was going to take you home.

652
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,000
I was going to cook for you.

653
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,520
I was going to
knit a jumper for you.

654
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,600
I was going to look after you.

655
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,280
I was unable to look after Mebrule.
But I was going to look after you.

656
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,480
I wasn't going to be like Mr Mehmet.
I was never going to moan.

657
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,440
I was going to look after you.

658
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,160
I thought of everything.

659
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
I was going to introduce you
to my daughter.

660
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,200
I was going to introduce you
to my grandchild.

661
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,680
I was going to say
"Look, this is Mrs Feza."

662
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,080
"She is a dear old friend of mine".

663
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,680
"She is not well".
"She is staying in a nursing home".

664
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,520
"But she is lonely and unhappy there".
"From now on, she'll be staying with us."

665
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,400
"She'll be forever staying with us".

666
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,760
Please, don't do this.

667
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,520
This can't be happening.

668
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,560
Olé, Olé, Olé.

669
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,880
[Hi Deva, I am the "Dog Killer".

670
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,800
[F... ck off!

671
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,480
[You don't believe me.]
[But this little gift may convince you.]

672
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,440
- Are you going out?
- I'll be right back.

673
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Nevra!

674
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Nevra!

675
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Nevra!

676
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,560
Wait!

677
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
Nevra!

678
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,600
Are you alright?

679
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,120
Reyhan.

680
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,720
What?

681
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,880
Reyhan committed suicide.

682
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,080
Who is Reyhan?

683
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,080
Don't tell anybody, O.K?

684
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,720
You promised Nevra.
Don't forget.

685
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,440
O.K, I won't forget.
