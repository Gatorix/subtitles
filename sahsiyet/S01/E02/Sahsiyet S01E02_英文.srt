1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,280
<i>Remember..</i>.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,280
You have early stage Alzheimer's.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,320
<i>- Have you gone to a vacation or something?
- No</i>.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,320
- So Munir has never been alone?
- No.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,600
<i>You forgot to give water to your cat</i>.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>How does it feel
to be the only woma</i>n

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,880
<i>working in an homicide bureau
with 140 staff members</i>?

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,400
I chose you from 50 girls.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,840
<i>How nice</i>.

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,520
<i>Since I won't remember,
I can do anything I want, is that so</i>?

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,080
<i>Exactly</i>.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,920
<i>Do you have farsighted glasses</i>?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,880
I MET A GIRL TODAY.
HER NAME WAS NEVRA ELMAS.

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,680
Chief Inspector Tolga Yazgan.
Who is this?

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,520
<i>I must have dialed
the wrong number</i>.

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,400
This is Mehmet Yurtgil's home, miss.
Who were you calling?

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,880
<i>I am his daughter.
I was calling my dad</i>.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
<i>Did something happen to him? Hello</i>?

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,040
Yes... I'm afraid so, miss.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,400
DO NOT CROSS POLICE LINE

21
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Follow me.

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,720
- Who did this, then?
- I don't know.

23
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,000
You?

24
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,920
If you're hiding something,
you'll be complicit. You know that?

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,720
I told you. I don't know him.

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Neither his wife, nor him.

27
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,680
So be it.

28
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,800
Whoever killed him,
must know you, then.

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Think about it.

30
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,800
Who is able to commit
such a thing around you?

31
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,200
- Nobody.
- How do you know?

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,200
I know everybody.

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,520
None of them
could do such a bad thing.

34
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
This is murder.

35
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Me?

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
For instance.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,320
You think I could do it?

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
No.

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
You know why you say no?

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,280
Because you're afraid to say yes.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Why would I be afraid?

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,080
Because if you said yes,
then I could...

43
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,320
Here, in the middle of this road,

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,840
just shoot and kill you.

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,120
And nobody would really know.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,800
You'd be terrified. Understand?

47
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>All the evil in this world
is done by people we don't really know</i>.

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,000
<i>That's why the first thing we do
when we wake up is..</i>.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
<i>To fool ourselves</i>.

50
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,720
<i>So I'm asking again</i>.

51
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Who could have done such a thing?

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,560
I have no idea.

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,720
Chief...

54
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,680
Agah. Agah.

55
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,240
Agah! Agah! Please!

56
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,000
Agah!

57
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
Agah, what have you done?

58
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,080
Here you go.

59
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
What have you done?

60
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
Take that out of the rent.

61
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,880
What time is it?

62
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,640
- Ten past one.
- Good, there's time.

63
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Sorry, Agah,
how do you know Kurdish?

64
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,080
- Kurdish, why?
- You just spoke it.

65
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,920
Sometimes she doesn't
recall her own name.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
Can't you see her?

67
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,040
What could my mum tell you?

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
She dances well, I heard.

69
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,440
- Didn't they have a caretaker?
- Of course they had.

70
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,920
But my dad, bless him.

71
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
He was a difficult person.

72
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,960
Whoever they hired
left after three days.

73
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,040
The last one left a week ago.

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,800
They were alone since.

75
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,800
Do you have the details
of the caretakers?

76
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,760
Yes. I have everything.

77
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,320
We spoke all the time.

78
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,240
I'll give the numbers.

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
Can we leave now?

80
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,080
Sure. You've had quite a journey.

81
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,320
One last thing.

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Anybody who'd want to kill your father?

83
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,640
Any name comes to mind?

84
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,040
Who'd want to kill him?

85
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Miss! Your father was a judge
in criminal court.

86
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,040
He must have put somebody in prison.

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
But he retired years ago.

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,280
- Since you're coming from Madrid...
<i>- Olé</i>!

89
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Mom!

90
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,560
Let me tell you this way:

91
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,360
- Bullfighters fight until they retire.
- <i>Olé</i>!

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Mom.

93
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,640
- But bulls fight until they die.
<i>- Olé</i>!

94
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,720
<i>- Olé</i>!
- Mom!

95
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
<i>- Olé</i>!
- Mom.

96
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
MY CAR TAKES PETROL. NOT DIESEL!

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
All right, sir.

98
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,040
- You fill it up?
- Yes, I made it "full".

99
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,880
- Petrol.
- Yes.

100
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Good.

101
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
But I'll tell you something.

102
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
You don't make something full.

103
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,160
It doesn't exist in any language.

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't use it again, okay?

105
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
Better forget the word.

106
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,800
Wouldn't that be awesome?

107
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,800
If we forget everything wrong,

108
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,080
and only remember
the correct things?

109
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,600
But don't you worry.

110
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,080
There's a lot of wrong in here.
For example...

111
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,720
I thought my daughter was happy,
but she wasn't.

112
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,080
- Sir, it's 200.
- Huh?

113
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,840
200. Your bill.

114
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
Take that upstairs.

115
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,600
We've flown 20 hours,
and the car ride tired me more.

116
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,720
Why do you say that?

117
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
You took the scenic route,
like a cabbie.

118
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,320
The usual route had rush hour.

119
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
That's...

120
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,800
That's why.

121
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,480
You've been living here for years.
How could you be confused?

122
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,600
I wasn't confused.

123
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,080
- You didn't eat anything.
- I'm not hungry.

124
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you ill or something?

125
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,600
What are you talking about?

126
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,440
Dad, what the hell?
I just left my bloody house.

127
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
What do you mean, ill?

128
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,680
Okay. Won't you go back?

129
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,200
- Are you kicking us out?
- Of course not...

130
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,200
Don't worry. We won't stay long.

131
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,720
- I didn't say anything.
- Isn't number eight empty anyway?

132
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
We'll stay there.

133
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,880
I'll find myself a job.

134
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,040
I could pay rent, too. Okay?

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
Dad...

136
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,560
I'm saying that I took my child,

137
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,440
I left my house and come here.

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,360
You're asking me if I'm...
I'm not going back!

139
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,640
- Okay, don't.
- I'm not!

140
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,200
All right, don't go.

141
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,320
Never mind.

142
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
I can't take it anymore.

143
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,880
- I just can't.
- I beg of you, Zuhal.

144
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,080
Daddy!

145
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,040
Please, Zuhal. My baby.

146
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,800
- What will I do now, daddy?
- You'll make him sad, too.

147
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,480
But I just rented number eight.

148
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,960
He just moved in.

149
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,520
CRIMINAL COURTS OF PEACE

150
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,200
THE NEW JUDGE VISITED
THE DISTRICT GOVERNOR

151
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
Speak with the lab yet?

152
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,560
I did. They're working on it.

153
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,440
I was just trying to see
where he previously worked.

154
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,080
Maybe I could see something.

155
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,440
They'll call after the autopsy.
Don't go anywhere.

156
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,720
- Won't you go in?
- Who am I?

157
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
We have you, after all.

158
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,840
But leave the file on my desk
so I'll teach you to read.

159
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,600
Teach her to write, too.

160
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,720
Ever seen me half-ass something?

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,040
Of course I will.

162
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,040
It's my job.

163
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,200
True.

164
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,080
See, I can write.

165
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
Don't have to teach me that.

166
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,520
I MET AN OAF TODAY.
HIS NAME WAS FIRUZ.

167
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,640
- Did he go to sleep?
- Yeah.

168
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,000
Is the bed all right?

169
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,600
It is, it is but...

170
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,520
I wish it could be all right up here.

171
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,400
- Is that my Walkman?
- Uh-huh.

172
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,840
- Does it still work?
- It does.

173
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,720
Where's the TV, dad?

174
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,240
I gave it to someone
who needed it.

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,400
- Don't you watch it?
- I watched forty years of it.

176
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,560
- Okay, good night then.
- Good night, sweetie.

177
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
- Zuhal.
- What?

178
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,800
Take the spare key in that bowl.

179
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
I gave one to Deva, too.

180
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Yes?

181
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Okay.

182
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
I'll be there in twenty minutes.

183
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,560
Good luck with that.

184
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,840
DEAR DIARY

185
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,120
I ONLY TRUST HER.
BECAUSE NEVRA UNDERSTANDS ME.

186
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,440
<i>Timur, are you in?
It's me, Nevra</i>.

187
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm coming...

188
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,080
Welcome.

189
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,080
We've spoken before,
but never met in person.

190
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
Yes, hi.

191
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,120
Nobody has any respect to the people
in here. They barge in.

192
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
That's why I lock the door.

193
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,760
I had something else to do.
That's why I was late.

194
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,280
You're just in time.

195
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,600
I was on a break.

196
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,240
You'll get used to it.

197
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,120
People get used to the dead.

198
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,560
They can't harm anybody.

199
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,120
Not anymore, I mean.

200
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,920
The thing is to get used to the living.

201
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,760
That's the hard part.

202
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
You want something to drink?
I can make some coffee.

203
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,640
If you're making some for yourself.

204
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Did he really have a label
on his forehead with your name on it?

205
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,840
- Yeah.
- A serial killer situation.

206
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
It is.

207
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,600
But, difficult to find one
in this country of course.

208
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,720
There are no serial killers in Turkey.

209
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,880
There are people
who go on a killing spree.

210
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
<i>Now..</i>.

211
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,680
The shot was in point-blank range.

212
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,640
Less than two or three meters.

213
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,840
No signs of a struggle.

214
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
He's been dead
for 96 hours at the most.

215
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,320
There's one entry wound, 7.65.

216
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,440
Any sugar or milk in your coffee?

217
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
Nope.

218
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,320
Hello?

219
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,000
Okay.

220
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,360
I'll be there soon.

221
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,600
It was the lab.
They found a match for the prints.

222
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,280
Seriously? You found him then?

223
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,080
Thanks for the coffee.

224
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
See you later.

225
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,920
Your honor.

226
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,040
When will you legalize this?

227
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,720
Can you reach
the prosecutor in charge?

228
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,600
We'll need a warrant of arrest.

229
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,160
I believe I'm getting the hang of this.

230
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,600
I really do.

231
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,240
I wish Mebrure could see this.

232
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,400
We loved each other so.

233
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,320
So many memories.

234
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,120
My only hope

235
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,000
is to die before I forget them all.

236
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,320
But how would you know that? Right?

237
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,240
Don't tell me that you loved too.

238
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,360
Yours isn't love. It's rancor.

239
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,120
You don't love with rancor.

240
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,240
- Is that the man's home?
- Yeah.

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
- He's armed, of course.
- Probably, yes.

242
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
We'll go in, pick him up, then leave.

243
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Pity.

244
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,760
You wasted it all.

245
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,400
Your wife obviously
loved you so much.

246
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,800
Moved heaven and earth
to make a home for you.

247
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,480
You took her for granted.

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,840
I forgive everything...

249
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,280
But I don't forgive anyone
who takes his wife for granted.

250
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
I have to be frank. I'm sorry.

251
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,440
Don't look at me like that.

252
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,440
I could have picked somebody else.

253
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
But you're very guilty.

254
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
And you weren't properly punished.

255
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
What's eight years?

256
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,440
"Unjust provocation...

257
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,080
Time off for good behavior."
Mitigation after mitigation.

258
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,800
They could have given you a medal too.

259
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,440
I've read the trial records.

260
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,320
They gave proper consideration

261
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,200
but they didn't deal
proper retribution.

262
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,280
Therefore...

263
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,920
You're getting your
real punishment in here.

264
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
You know what your punishment is?

265
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,440
You'll be my murder weapon.

266
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,520
Good, isn't it?

267
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,560
Clear. Perp is not in.
We're moving out.

268
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,640
We're going in.
We'll conduct a search.

269
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,240
That's Salih.

270
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,680
He's a decent lorry driver.

271
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,120
He even helped us move,

272
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,520
and Mebrure is
extraordinarily fussy.

273
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,480
You'll be killing Salih!

274
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Come on.

275
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,640
Give me your finger.

276
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
Don't be difficult,
my back is aching up. Come on.

277
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,640
It was so easy the last time.
Give me your finger.

278
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,160
Look.

279
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,040
If you'll be nice,

280
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,560
I'll handcuff you the other way.
It'll be more comfortable. Deal?

281
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,760
Agreed? Come. Give me your finger.

282
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,760
Come on, give it to me.

283
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
You're mad at me.

284
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,800
But anyone else would've cut it off.

285
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,240
We're done.

286
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,400
Of course
only serving a sentence wouldn't do.

287
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,760
You need rehabilitation.

288
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,040
What's a sentence good for
without rehabilitation?

289
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,440
Nothing.

290
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,080
Everyone collects something.

291
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,440
And this is my collection.

292
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,520
I have a lot more,
but this is special for you.

293
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Keep this between us...

294
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,680
I pinched these from case files,
back in the day.

295
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,440
You look at them well,

296
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,680
and think of the nasty things
that you've done.

297
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Okay?

298
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,640
<i>All things packed away,
Along with yourself</i>.

299
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,920
<i>Memories are scattered,
To the room, everywhere</i>.

300
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,680
<i>The perfume I'm used to
Is no longer there</i>.

301
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,280
<i>You</i>.

302
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,600
<i>Your smile has faded
From the nooks of the house</i>.

303
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,960
<i>Loneliness is bitter
Please don't leave me</i>.

304
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,040
<i>We have loved this
Colorless world together</i>.

305
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,640
<i>You</i>.

306
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,280
<i>My woman</i>.

307
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
<i>My woman</i>.

308
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,320
<i>Remember when
In the street across</i>.

309
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,680
<i>We have kissed
For the first time in my life</i>.

310
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,400
<i>Locked in embrace
One spring morning</i>.

311
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
<i>You</i>.

312
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,160
<i>The lights are off
The house is under dark</i>.

313
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,280
<i>Our warm sunlit house
Has now grown cold</i>.

314
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,200
<i>Nights go on forever
I keep on weeping</i>.

315
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
<i>You</i>.

316
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
<i>My woman</i>.

317
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,080
<i>My woman</i>.

318
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,280
- Oh dear!
- Dad!

319
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
So sorry, sweetie. I...

320
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,680
You're up? Come in.

321
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,640
Of course I'm up.
You knocked the door all night.

322
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,480
Zuhal! Deva speaks!

323
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,080
Deva spoke to me
for the first time!

324
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,440
Good job, Deva!
Good morning, Deva!

325
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
- Good morning.
- Enjoy your breakfast, Deva.

326
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,320
Come sweetie.
Everything's ready.

327
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,440
I won't stay, daddy.
I have to go out.

328
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,440
There was this Onat
in my old company.

329
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,600
I wrote to him yesterday about a job.

330
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,720
- You just arrived, sweetie.
- Yes.

331
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,840
But we have to settle down
as soon as possible.

332
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,480
I'll drop by Deva's school, too.

333
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,880
I hope they don't give me a rough time,
with it being mid-semester, and all.

334
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,080
Sit down, have some tea.
I'll make you coffee.

335
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll get something later.

336
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,080
You'll have a good time,
grandfather and grandson.

337
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,400
Sure. I'll show Deva around.

338
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,800
May I have some bread, Deva?

339
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,920
You're free to be alone, if you want.

340
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,280
Actually, you're free to be alone.

341
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,680
I slept like a log last night.

342
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,400
Nevra.

343
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,840
Sorry, Chief. I dozed off.

344
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,560
We ID'd the perp
and raided his house last night...

345
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,040
Okay, okay. Calm down.

346
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,640
I've heard everything.

347
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
Go home, get some sleep.

348
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,480
Come back in the afternoon.

349
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,480
But you had to inform Firuz last night.

350
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,880
- It all happened so quickly.
- The damage is done.

351
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,800
You go home now, okay?

352
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,680
- Good night.
- Good morning.

353
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,840
Agah?

354
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,320
- Agah, how are you?
- Thanks, Rustem. You?

355
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
Fine, can't complain.
Who's the lad?

356
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,480
My grandson. He's arrived
yesterday with his mother.

357
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,680
Joyous news.
You know your grandfather?

358
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,160
He's a killer.

359
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,480
You've killed the instrument.

360
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,240
You stabbed the drum!

361
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,560
But thanks. They were
being obnoxiously loud.

362
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
We'll have some peace of mind.

363
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,440
See you later.

364
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,200
Okay then.

365
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
- You stabbed a drum?
- What?

366
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,640
Oh, it's not a big deal.

367
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Could I drop you off somewhere?

368
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,280
Nah, I can go myself.

369
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,960
Okay.

370
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,000
Have fun, then.

371
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
You too.

372
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
- Okay, see you later.
- Fine.

373
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,520
Salih the lorry driver.

374
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,240
I know what you like.

375
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I dropped in
without an appointment, sorry.

376
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,120
Sending your CV
would have been fine,

377
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,720
but Onat specially requested.

378
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,560
<i>You lived in Australia</i>?

379
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
Yes, four years in Sydney.

380
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,120
We just came back.

381
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,720
- Why the laugh?
- I don't know.

382
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,480
People kill to be there,
everyone's trying to leave.

383
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,920
But you've come back.

384
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,600
You were a former employee of ours?

385
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,240
Yes, but...

386
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,280
I mean... I worked here.
But things changed a lot.

387
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,800
You come to me every day like
it's your job, and you leave a 100?

388
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,920
Go away.

389
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,080
This room hasn't changed.

390
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,400
Still the same.

391
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,600
Congratulations.

392
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
No one drops by Human Resources,

393
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,480
but you seem to remember it well.

394
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,440
No, this was my room.

395
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,680
<i>And the chair's the same, too</i>.

396
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,520
<i>That used to be my chair</i>.

397
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
This used to be
another department?

398
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
No.

399
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,160
It was Human Resources.

400
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,680
<i>I was at your position</i>.

401
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
<i>Really</i>?

402
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
<i>Miss..</i>.

403
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
<i>Are you here
to take my job away</i>?

404
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
<i>No</i>.

405
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,640
<i>I thought that maybe
you'd need some help</i>.

406
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,840
How could you forget
about filling up?

407
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,640
- Come in.
- Doctor, I'm so sorry...

408
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,720
- Doctor, it's important.
- Sir, excuse me.

409
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,400
Agah, come in. Please, calm down.

410
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We're okay.

411
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,800
I have to tell you.

412
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,880
LADIES' ROOM

413
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,720
Nevra.

414
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,960
If you pull anything like this again,
I'll make you sorry. You hear me?

415
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,160
If you have more of those threats,
I'll stay in here.

416
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Huh?

417
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,600
Shit!

418
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,840
MESSAGE FROM THE KILLER

419
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,960
<i>What will I do</i>?

420
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,960
If I'm already forgetting
such vital things...

421
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,560
Should I change prescriptions,
you think?

422
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,080
I forget to fill up sometimes.

423
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,880
Don't be so hard on yourself.

424
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,880
No one can remember
everything completely and without error.

425
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,680
You'll run out of petrol or gas!

426
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,040
What's important is to stay calm.

427
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,440
And to find a solution.

428
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,200
You can't let anything
out of the ordinary get to you.

429
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,880
Sometimes the best plan
is to not have a plan.

430
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,680
Make your mind up.

431
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,880
Do I have a plan, or not?

432
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,840
Do. Do have your plan.

433
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,920
I'm telling you to make changes
when necessary.

434
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,480
I get it. I'm not that old.

435
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,720
We're settled, then.

436
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,680
So I don't need
to have a plan all the time.

437
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
No.

438
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,560
Adapt yourself.

439
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,120
If only we could
plan everything in advance...

440
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,880
There's luck to be reckoned with.

441
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,360
Sometimes you have to trust your luck,

442
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,000
and sometimes you
just have to accept it.

443
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,720
There's something else
that's important.

444
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,600
I used to work in the Silopi
Court of Justice for three years.

445
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,160
I thought I forgot,

446
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,880
but I didn't forget to speak Kurdish.

447
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,800
No ATMs...
We've been looking all morning. Nothing!

448
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,120
- We can't see the turn.
- But everybody's seeing this.

449
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,600
- How could this happen?
- I've heard about it. I saw it.

450
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,520
- But that's how he works.
- Who is he?

451
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,560
That charlatan journalist, Ates Arbay.

452
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,440
But I'm not mad at him.

453
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,880
I'm not mad at him!

454
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,640
I'm mad at the idiot...

455
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm mad at the fool

456
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,280
that sells this piece
for a handful of money!

457
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,920
They'll send an inspector,
and then we'll see!

458
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,280
That's what's going to happen.

459
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
Don't we have any other footage?

460
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,840
No, Chief.

461
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,040
I don't want Deva to lose a year.

462
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,800
I see.

463
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,360
This relocation
is already taking its toll on him.

464
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,240
Of course.

465
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,960
So what do you say?

466
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,280
You think something could be arranged?
Could you take him?

467
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,480
What do you say, headmaster?
Could you enroll him?

468
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,920
<i>I remember Deva now</i>.

469
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,080
Such a sweet kid.
Had excellent grades.

470
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,520
He used to play something, too.
What was it, a guitar?

471
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,280
- It was a violin.
- Yes, it was.

472
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,880
Does he still play?

473
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,040
No, I'm afraid not.

474
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,440
He doesn't play anymore.

475
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,960
Who knows,
maybe we'll have him pick it up again.

476
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,560
Will you enroll him, then?

477
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,400
To be honest,
we don't have a place at the school.

478
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,480
But I'll do an exception for your son.

479
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,480
- Thank you.
- But...

480
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,640
The payment will be different this time.

481
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,520
Since you're here mid-year,
you won't get the discount.

482
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,920
I trust that's not a problem?

483
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,200
- You have a cigarette?
- No.

484
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,040
You have money?

485
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
No.

486
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,840
How will you screw her, then?

487
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,080
She's a straight up whore.

488
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,960
And are you her pimp?

489
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,200
I could be.

490
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,640
Okay.

491
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,680
And who is your pimp?

492
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,840
What did you say?
I'll fuck you up.

493
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,200
Stop looking at me.

494
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Come here.

495
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
Stop!

496
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Come here!

497
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,240
Agah, don't waste your time.
It's out of order again.

498
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,760
I spoke to the mechanic,
but he'll come late. He was busy.

499
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,440
I have the worst luck.

500
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,280
- Rustem.
- Yes, sir.

501
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,360
- Give me a number.
- Are you playing the numbers?

502
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,400
- Just give me one.
- If it wins, we're partners.

503
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,200
- 39.
- Has to be up to 27.

504
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,520
If it's above 27,
it's not a lucky number, huh?

505
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,360
Okay then, 24.

506
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,120
- No, 26.
- Make your mind up.

507
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,080
In that case...

508
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,160
- Who am I speaking to?
- I'm from the newspaper Simdi.

509
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,720
<i>Ates Arbay.
How do you do, Nevra</i>?

510
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,360
Where did you find this number?

511
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,000
<i>I know you're angry, but..</i>.

512
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,880
<i>Why'd you want to have
an interview with me</i>?

513
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,800
- They asked me everything.
- Yes.

514
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,840
<i>I know they did, but..</i>.

515
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
<i>they didn't ask you the right questions</i>.

516
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,520
What is that gift you have for me
that'll be so useful?

517
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,480
<i>Some information
that exists in the outer space</i>.

518
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,200
<i>But you can't have it
without an interview</i>.

519
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,680
I'll be the judge of that.

520
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,240
I'll have to see what you have.

521
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,920
And we'll see what we can do.

522
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,120
Let's meet. Be at Isyan Sanayi
after 10:30, tonight.

523
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,120
Isyan Sanayi?

524
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,440
- Deva?
- It's me, mom.

525
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:58,240
- I... drank a bit.
- I know.

526
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,920
Don't tell your father.

527
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,320
Okay, go to sleep.

528
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,680
Okay. Just, don't tell him.

529
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,440
Don't say that I drank.

530
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,040
Don't tell him, okay sweetie?

531
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
What are you doing?

532
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,440
What is this?
Do you want to run me over?

533
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,200
Hey.

534
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,760
- You were going to hit me.
- Don't get mad.

535
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,200
I'm out.

536
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,840
Goodness.

537
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,520
- Do you like the music?
- You're wasting your time.

538
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,920
There's no such thing
as 'DJ music'. Never will be.

539
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,560
Don't tell anybody.

540
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,560
Who leaked the news, Ates?

541
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,960
I'll always remember this
first time you said my name.

542
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,800
In a moment you asked me
something impossible.

543
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,040
Don't do it.

544
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,600
Can I have my gift now?

545
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,800
I don't know. Can you?

546
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,760
First the firewater.

547
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,360
- What do you pay for a gram?
- What?

548
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,600
Cocaine, I mean.
How much do you pay?

549
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,320
They're overcharging you, I bet.

550
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,360
Don't worry.

551
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,720
You're just an information
in an outer space.

552
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,880
What do you mean?

553
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,760
You're just a number
in a dealer's mobile phone. See?

554
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,960
Is there a computer I could use?

555
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,000
You could work here
without interruption.

556
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,240
I have to be back on duty.

557
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,560
Okay, thanks.

558
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,880
Nevra.

559
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,320
- Will I be in trouble?
- You will.

560
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,800
If there's a dealer like that
somewhere, you will.

561
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,480
Glad to meet you, Nevra.

562
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,920
So am I.

563
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,160
<i>- Are we recording right now?
- Yes, we are</i>.

564
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,920
<i>- You'll give me a copy, right?
- I said okay</i>.

565
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,120
<i>I'll read you a list. The courthouse
at Caldıran has burnt down</i>.

566
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,000
<i>So did the one at Sefilpınar</i>.

567
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,840
<i>So did the one at Kambura</i>.

568
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,480
<i>But you tell me
you had nothing to do with them</i>.

569
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,680
<i>No. How could I have the time
for all of that</i>?

570
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,880
<i>Some other brothers
must have taken care of them</i>.

571
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,600
<i>How did you begin</i>?

572
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,560
<i>There was this man,
and he had a file in the courthouse</i>.

573
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,280
<i>But it's all slander</i>.

574
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,280
<i>They made up all the accusations</i>.

575
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,760
<i>And I couldn't stand for
any injustice like that</i>.

576
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,120
<i>I'm a bailiff there, as you know</i>.

577
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,240
<i>I burned the whole thing down</i>.

578
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,080
<i>So that justice prevails
in the end, you know</i>?

579
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,840
Oh, man.

580
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,040
Oh, man!

581
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,440
Why did you shoot me, man?

582
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,320
What did I do to you?

583
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,640
You haven't changed at all, Naimhan.

584
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:08,760
Not at all.

585
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,080
You used to be like this.

586
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,480
Always drunk.

587
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,080
Aren't you afraid of what
you'll do to your liver?

588
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,800
You wouldn't live long, anyway.

589
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,080
You would live a bit longer, I suppose.

590
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,320
It wasn't your day.

591
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,040
But so it goes.

592
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,760
I ran out of petrol.

593
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,640
I forgot to fill up the tank.

594
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,400
And you suddenly appeared.

595
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,320
I wasn't expecting it at all.

596
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,720
But the doctor said so.

597
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,800
Luck really does have
to be reckoned with.

598
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,840
It's hard to follow people.

599
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,840
Very hard.

600
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,120
Pursue them all day,

601
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,560
wait outside their place.

602
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,760
What do they do,
where do they go?

603
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,120
When do they go to sleep,
when do they wake up?

604
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,800
It's like having a job.

605
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,880
Really.

606
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,600
Man.

607
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,960
Where do you know me from?

608
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,440
Where did we meet?

609
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,880
Where are you from?

610
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,040
Kambura.

611
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,280
And that's where I know you from.

612
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,520
Don't do it, man...

613
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,520
I beg you, don't, man.

614
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,240
I'm not doing anything, Naimhan.

615
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,480
I haven't done anything.

616
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,680
You did it.

617
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,320
You and them.

618
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,080
All of you.

619
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,440
You shouldn't have.

620
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,560
I ONLY TRUST HER.
BECAUSE NEVRA UNDERSTANDS ME.
