1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,360
<i>Remember..</i>.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,280
<i>There must be something that
you always wanted to do but you couldn't</i>.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,880
<i>There are many things I want to do</i>.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,880
<i>Very good</i>.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>Whatever it is, however it is done</i>,

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,880
<i>you will start doing it
with utmost planning</i>.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
<i>You should have daily,
weekly, monthly plans</i>.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>You won't cut corners.
You'll make it complicated</i>.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,400
Dad, don't you remember anything?

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,480
Dad, I'm getting a divorce.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,280
<i>I'll introduce you to someone</i>.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>But that's how he works</i>.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,160
- Who is he?
- That charlatan journalist, Ates Arbay.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,640
<i>I used to be a fiery
and an idealist reporter</i>.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,840
Oh, poor Agah.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,080
What have you done?

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
AFTER 2 AM - CUSTOMERS LEAVE -
THE DOORS ARE LOCKED

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,120
LIFE BEGINS SIGNED: AGAH BEYOGLU

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,640
What do I do with him now?

20
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>They had "Nevra" written
on their foreheads. What's with that</i>?

21
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,160
<i>Just a coincidence.
It has nothing to do with me</i>.

22
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,280
Selim, I actually have a question.

23
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,400
Do you know someone named
Naimhan Turedi?

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,320
- Naimhan...
- Turedi. Born in Kambura.

25
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,160
Oh yes, of course I do.

26
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Yasin used to collect trash over
by the garage. He's dead now.

27
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,440
They had sons. Not good for anything.

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,400
They all left for Istanbul.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,840
How about someone
named Mehmet Yurtgil? A judge.

30
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,560
- He was assigned to here?
- No. He might've passed by, though.

31
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
I don't remember the name.

32
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Alright.

33
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,280
I'll speak to the guys over
at the station.

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,120
Come by again, though,
this time for dinner.

35
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,240
Don't even think about going back
before stopping by one last time.

36
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,400
Sure.

37
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Where's Agah Beyoglu?
He's my dad. Where's my dad?

38
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,160
He was discharged.

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,280
Discharged? When?

40
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,920
He was right there when I went to sleep.
I wake up and he's gone.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,960
When was he discharged?

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,680
Ms. Zuhal, your father
left in a hurry. He left you a note.

43
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,200
- Dad?
- Over here.

44
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,080
What are you doing, dad?

45
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
How about I don't share the details?

46
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,680
What is this note? Huh?

47
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,560
"I'm going to get the car.
See you at the house."

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
<i>We were worried sick.
You should've let us know</i>.

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,720
I'm not used to letting people know.

50
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,720
I haven't been letting anyone
know anything since your mother died.

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,240
That's some excuse!

52
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
We were worried sick about you!
How about some thoughtfulness?

53
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,360
You should really stop shouting.
I can't hear you anyway.

54
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
KILLER OR VICTIM?

55
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,320
KAMBURA POLICE DEPARTMENT

56
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Nevra? Welcome!

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,240
It's me, Vural.

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,320
- Vural?
- See?

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,520
Once someone leaves Kambura,
they forget all about their past.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,960
You're hurting me.

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,280
- Vural.
- Yes, Vural.

62
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,560
Sorry, didn't recognize you.

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
Of course not.
Istanbul is another world.

64
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,960
We've been reading all about you
on the newspapers, though.

65
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,000
I saw you driving earlier today,
but you were gone before I could say hi.

66
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,080
Welcome.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thanks.

68
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,320
- How's Aunt Nesrin doing? Well, I hope?
- Sure.

69
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,160
Don't you worry. I'll take care of it.

70
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Excuse me?

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Your door. I'll get it fixed.

72
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,760
What a shame.

73
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,400
I can take care of it.

74
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Come on...

75
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,520
You're not coming
back to Kambura anytime soon.

76
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You shouldn't.

77
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
At least let me pay for it.

78
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,080
Your money's no good here.

79
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,680
- Anyway, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

80
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,080
Agah! Come out!

81
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Isn't Istanbul real expensive?
How can you make it with your salary?

82
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,000
I make do.

83
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,160
Any information?

84
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,520
Can't find anything.
He left Kambura a long time ago.

85
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,440
It's been years.

86
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,640
No info whatsoever since they've left.

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,240
But I'll tell the guys to keep looking.

88
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,200
We'll let you know if we have something.

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,160
So how do you make it?
Do you rent your place?

90
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Agah!

91
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Come out!

92
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,200
Agah! You can't hide from me!

93
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,600
I'll burn this whole place down!

94
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,760
Come on, join us.

95
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,160
So...

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,400
Does Kambura feel any different?

97
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,280
Not at all. It's exactly the same.

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,520
I recall when you
used to be a little girl.

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
How old were you?

100
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Ten.

101
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,120
I've been courting your mom
ever since then. She's never interested.

102
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm not surprised.

103
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,720
I'll kill you.

104
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
You're being too much.

105
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Salih...

106
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
Come on, let me go.

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,200
We can go our separate ways.

108
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,920
Besides, you're wounded.
Don't let it get infected.

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,080
You're the one who shot me, you lunatic!

110
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,280
It was a mistake! It was an accident!

111
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,560
You shot me point blank!
How is that an accident?

112
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,600
How did you find me?
Have you been following me?

113
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,520
Why would I be following you?

114
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,360
My car broke down and you were
the first car to come by!

115
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,800
It was a coincidence! It was fate!

116
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm putting the gun away.

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
See?

118
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,040
I've put it away. See?

119
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,400
Come on, you put yours away,
as well, Salih.

120
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,840
Salih...

121
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Come over and let's talk,
brother to brother.

122
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,400
Come on.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,520
Remember our conversations
back in Kambura?

124
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,720
You're like a brother to me.
Come on, don't do this.

125
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,560
Salih...

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,240
I used to go to the post office every day.
Just to see your mom.

127
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,960
I used to send fake letters.

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
But I never got the chance to meet her.

129
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,120
One day, they told me she'd left.

130
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,240
It had only been six or seven months
since she'd started here.

131
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,240
- She left so soon.
- It was a year. We stayed for a year.

132
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,040
Give or take.

133
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,680
I never got to meet her then,
but I got her in the end, after all.

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
It's delicious.

135
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
Enjoy.

136
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
Salih...

137
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,240
Come on, let's have a chat.
We're brothers.

138
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Salih...

139
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
Tell me, why?

140
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,400
Why did you come after me
after all these years?

141
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,560
Why did you try to kill me?

142
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
What did I do to you?

143
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,080
That's funny.

144
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,400
- That's what Naimhan asked.
- Naimhan?

145
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
What did you do to him?

146
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,880
What did you do to Naimhan?

147
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,880
Tell me!

148
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,000
Salih, if this is the end of the road...

149
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,160
Then let me do it.

150
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,680
- Drop your gun. Drop it!
- I'm not dropping it.

151
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,520
I'll fuck you up! Drop it!

152
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,440
I won't let you die before telling me
why you tried to kill me.

153
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,080
Tell me, why!

154
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,200
Why were you after me?

155
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Conscience.

156
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,880
Conscience?

157
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,840
What conscience?
What does that have to do with anything?

158
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,960
You know what conscience means, don't you?

159
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,160
Fuck you and your conscience!

160
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,840
You won't look me in the eye?

161
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
It's been three years.

162
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,040
You haven't come to visit
for three whole years.

163
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,560
You kicked me out.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,560
You haven't even called.

165
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,440
You told me not to.

166
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,440
I did, because you left that cushy job
and went and became a cop!

167
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,800
What was all that education for?

168
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,000
See what it's come to?

169
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,040
You might've gotten yourself into trouble.

170
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,800
Your name,
written on the foreheads of dead men.

171
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,120
Nevra...

172
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,120
I worked my ass off to
get you through school.

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,800
I had to work as a cashier
in addition to my day job.

174
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,960
When that didn't do it...

175
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,640
You got married four times.

176
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,320
- I did it all for you.
- For me?

177
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,680
- So that you had a dad.
- So that I didn't become a whore.

178
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,440
Go on, say it.
That's what you've always said.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,360
You were so scared I'd go astray.
I never figured out why.

180
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,640
Do you want to become a whore?

181
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,240
Do you want to become a whore?

182
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
Why?

183
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Why would I?

184
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,840
You must've seen something deep within me.

185
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,080
- Don't be silly.
- You must have.

186
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
That's enough!

187
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,880
You got married four times for me!

188
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
You saved me!

189
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
That was so selfless of you!

190
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,720
So selfless of you to always have
a man around the house.

191
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,040
All you did to keep me
from becoming a whore...

192
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
Getting with new men
before even leaving the last one.

193
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,360
Shut up.

194
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
By the way...

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,960
I know you didn't ask,
but my father's doing fine.

196
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,560
He didn't say hi, but he's fine.

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,720
You still call him your father?

198
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,800
Your father's dead.

199
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,240
That bastard called Yuksel...

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
He isn't half the man your father was.

201
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,000
He's the one who gave you these ideas.

202
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,760
He's the one who made you into a cop.

203
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,200
Why so angry, mom?

204
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,360
Huh?

205
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Huh?

206
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,720
Tell me, why do you hate life so much?

207
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Why don't you love me?

208
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
Stop speaking nonsense.

209
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Then tell me you do.

210
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,160
Say "I love you, my girl."

211
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,040
By the way,
I hate the word "whore", you know.

212
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,440
It feels so dirty when I say it.

213
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,160
You're the only one I can say it to.

214
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
I become someone else when I'm with you.

215
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,440
Like a child. A naive, innocent child.

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,480
You do that to me.

217
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,000
I love you too, mom.

218
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
I love you too.

219
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,480
What's the emergency?

220
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,120
I had a heart attack.

221
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
- Alright. Come on in.
- Thank you.

222
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,920
A heart attack?

223
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,040
How's he doing now?

224
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
He's fine, he just needs some rest.

225
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,960
The doctor said his heart was strong.

226
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,120
He's too full of anger to die.

227
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,000
I was in the hospital,
but something urgent came up.

228
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,800
I had to do that. I had to get there.

229
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,920
But on my way there,
I forgot what I was supposed to do.

230
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,080
Mr. Agah...

231
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Excuse my bluntness,
but you'd had a heart attack.

232
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,040
You were in the hospital.
What could've been so urgent?

233
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,360
It was my daughter Zuhal's birthday.
I had to get her a present.

234
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,320
- Your daughter's here?
- I'm here now.

235
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,560
Looking for a job.

236
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,520
Still haven't found one.

237
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,040
Not sure what I'll do.

238
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,520
I'd like to meet her.

239
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,680
- We haven't even spoken on the phone.
- I know.

240
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,880
I'll come by unannounced, you know.

241
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
It's not the end of the world.

242
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,440
- If you're unhappy, then get divorced.
- I guess that's what we'll do.

243
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,320
I told Mebrure so many times
to divorce him, but she wouldn't listen.

244
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,600
- We don't listen, sometimes.
- Did it both to herself and to us.

245
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,800
- I was collateral damage, as well.
- My mom and dad were miserable.

246
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,200
My dumb sister.

247
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
- Being dumb isn't good.
- I'm in love, she said.

248
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,400
- I'm not even in love.
- Your mom was so naive.

249
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,960
- She would believe anything.
- I don't believe, though!

250
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
So what?

251
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,360
I used to lie all the time, doc.

252
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,960
When I was young.

253
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,400
I used to lie so often,
it was second nature to me.

254
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
It was almost a mania.

255
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,040
Mebrure used to believe anything I'd say.

256
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Deceiving her started feeling horrible.

257
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,040
I hated myself.

258
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,240
I promised I'd never lie to her again.

259
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,960
I'd be as honest with everyone else
as I was with myself.

260
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,760
Alas...

261
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,160
Once I was cursed with this disease...

262
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,200
This forgetting disease
called Alzheimer's...

263
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,960
That's when I started lying again.

264
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,160
You know what's the worst part
about being a liar?

265
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
Having to remember all the lies.

266
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,400
What am I supposed to do now?

267
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,000
Call your cousin.
We can call him together.

268
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,640
He'll find you a job that suits you. OK?

269
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,880
You don't need your father.
I'm right here for you.

270
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,520
He's the one who needs us.

271
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,960
He's never accepted it,
but he's always been the one who needs us.

272
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,560
He thought he could do no wrong.

273
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,000
Mebrure gave him everything she had.

274
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
<i>I'm losing my personality</i>.

275
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,640
It's too much to bear.

276
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,640
Here's what we'll do.

277
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,160
- You can't bear the truth, you lie.
- Yes.

278
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,320
- We'll discover that moment together.
- How are we going to do that?

279
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,600
The moment
you started running from reality.

280
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,040
And why you keep running.

281
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,720
That's what we'll go looking for.

282
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,720
But I don't know why.

283
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,240
You might not know.

284
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,880
But your memory does.

285
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,440
Ask your memory.

286
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,240
Go into the past.

287
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,160
Go to the places
that remind you of your past.

288
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Whatever it is that's scaring you

289
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,600
is hidden in your past.

290
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
Find it, Mr. Agah.

291
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,760
Find the first truth that terrified you.

292
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,800
INCOMING CALL ATES ARBAY

293
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
Yes, Ates?

294
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,680
<i>Is it time yet</i>?

295
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,120
Time for what?

296
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,760
<i>You've promised me an interview.
Can we do it tonight</i>?

297
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,920
I'm busy, Ates. Another time.

298
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,080
<i>I didn't let you down
the last time you called</i>.

299
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,920
Fine. Where do we meet?

300
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,280
Give me some space, please.

301
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,160
- Huh?
- Take off.

302
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,760
Take off where?

303
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,240
I'm expecting someone.
There's an empty seat over there.

304
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,720
I'm not going anywhere!

305
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,760
My dearly departed wife will be here soon.

306
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Go on.

307
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,320
Mebrure!

308
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,320
Mebrure!

309
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
I saw that.

310
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,600
Don't you have enough?

311
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,440
Don't look into the camera.
Look over there.

312
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,000
That's the last one.

313
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,880
Just like that.

314
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
Keep that pose.

315
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,840
Is it done?

316
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,040
No.

317
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,800
Stay just like that.

318
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,360
Just like that.

319
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Stay...

320
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
Almost there...

321
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
I've got it.

322
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,760
Finally.

323
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Let's get started on that interview.

324
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,400
Deva?

325
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,280
Where have you been, Deva?

326
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,240
I told my mom I was going out.

327
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,080
She didn't ask where you'd be?

328
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,040
- I don't explain myself anymore.
- Who did you take after, I wonder.

329
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,280
- You're so weird.
- I know.

330
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,640
You know...

331
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,360
I've been hearing about

332
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,440
increased drug use among teenagers.

333
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,320
- You don't do that, right.
- Of course not, grandpa.

334
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,320
Good. That's good to hear.

335
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,560
How about booze?

336
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,120
Only if you're buying.

337
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,840
I've got it. Thank you.

338
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,560
I want to speak to your
former colleagues, as well.

339
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,520
From the company you used to work for.

340
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,760
You can ask me whatever
you'd like to know.

341
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,560
Why?

342
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,040
Because I know them all,
but none of them know me.

343
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
Fine. Tell me something
you'd like to tell me.

344
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,240
That's the only question
that fits someone like you.

345
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,440
What would you like to say, Nevra?

346
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,200
What have you been up to today?

347
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,960
Today...

348
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,880
I went to the place where I proposed
to your grandmother. It was 40 years ago.

349
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

350
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Though.

351
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,120
I didn't propose this time.

352
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,320
What I'd like to say...

353
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,360
Is that I'm going to get that killer.

354
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,320
Wherever he runs to.

355
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,560
Wherever he hides.

356
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm going to find him, and arrest him.

357
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,360
You don't believe me?

358
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
I don't believe in anything anymore.

359
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,040
I don't even believe in myself.

360
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,840
But I so need to believe in someone.

361
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,080
I've been spending my years
in the back pages of the newspaper

362
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,680
in that DJ booth,

363
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,320
at those receptions I attend
just to get fucked up,

364
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,680
at the shitty premieres
of lame-ass movies.

365
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,920
Feels like I'm rotting from the inside.

366
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,760
I can't even bear to look
in the direction of those photos.

367
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,200
You still keep them up.

368
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
They're still there.

369
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,400
I told a lie that day.
Maybe the first lie of my whole life.

370
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,320
"Mebrure," I said,

371
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,120
"I'll make you happy."

372
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,440
"Mebrure, take my hand,
and let's get up off this bench,

373
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,800
and -excuse my French-let's
get the fuck out of here."

374
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,080
Without a care in the world.

375
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Or...

376
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,480
"Mebrure, forget you ever knew me..."

377
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,800
I'm not made for marriage.

378
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
"I'll only make you unhappy."

379
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,120
Something like that.

380
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,320
You can't hold your liquor at all,
can you?

381
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,440
You're already seeing double.
Where are you...

382
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,400
Go talk to her. Go on.

383
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,320
Think about what you're going to say.
You'll kick yourself later otherwise.

384
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,120
A miserable soul, desperate for attention.

385
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,320
The biggest favor you can do
for such a sociopath is to talk about him.

386
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,640
<i>But you've been on this case
ever since the murders started</i>.

387
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,640
<i>Isn't that a favor to him, then</i>?

388
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,400
<i>I'm a journalist</i>.

389
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,800
<i>I have to inform the public</i>.

390
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,240
<i>Ates, aren't you afraid at all
that the murderer will target you</i>?

391
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
<i>Look..</i>.

392
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,040
<i>Just like he has his eyes on me</i>,

393
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,640
<i>I have my eyes
on the perimeter of my house</i>.

394
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,920
<i>Remember, no one can turn invisible</i>.

395
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,480
<i>Least of all someone so deranged</i>.

396
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,400
This is what I do, you see.

397
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm in show business.

398
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,200
The show serves one purpose only...
To make people forget.

399
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,240
I'm in the forgetting business.

400
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,000
- You're being too harsh on yourself.
- It's how it works.

401
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Let's say there's a massacre somewhere.

402
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,080
There's an assassination,
but the assassin never gets caught.

403
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,520
I make people forget about them.

404
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,920
Has there been a huge fraud?
Call for me and I'll make them forget.

405
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
How? How do you make them forget?

406
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,320
With stories such as this one
about the murderer.

407
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,880
I spin a fairy tale.

408
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,040
They all listen with bated breath.

409
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
He gets caught and another one emerges.

410
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,760
He gets caught, and another one.

411
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,440
I tell all their stories.
But you know what I don't do?

412
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,640
How come so many people
are licensed to carry guns?

413
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,160
How come people
can access guns so easily?

414
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,160
I never talk about that.

415
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
You got it?

416
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,440
If you want to make people
forget about the gun,

417
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,480
all you have to do is
talk about the victim.

418
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,680
But I'm not doing it anymore.

419
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,720
I've had it up to here.

420
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,160
What will you do?

421
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,520
May I curse?

422
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I'll fuck them up.

423
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,320
I won't let people forget.

424
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,720
When did you decide on that?

425
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
Today.

426
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,040
As I was shooting you, to be precise.

427
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,080
You're so sweet.

428
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
The car...

429
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,520
Zuhal...

430
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,680
I've been thinking.

431
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,960
We should get you a place.

432
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,280
A place of your own.

433
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,240
You'd both be
more comfortable that way.

434
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,640
He'll have his own room, at least.

435
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,440
I can cover the rent
until you get a job.

436
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,760
When you said you'd been thinking,
I thought you'd be like...

437
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,800
"Let's sell the apartment downstairs
and get you a place of your own."

438
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,440
Something like that.

439
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,840
It's not like I haven't been doing that.

440
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,080
Number four, covered your high school.

441
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Number six, your college.

442
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Number seven, your master's in London.

443
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,600
Number three, as you know,
went towards your mother's treatment.

444
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm all alone
in this huge building now.

445
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,600
- We still have Number eight, though.
- I told you I rent that out.

446
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,880
We can tell the tenants
we need to sell it. I can talk to them.

447
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,560
You can't talk to them.
They're using it for storage.

448
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,080
They live abroad.

449
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,520
I can call them, then.
Just give me their number.

450
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Of course.
We can sell this apartment, as well.

451
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
You can put me in a home.

452
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,320
Even better,
you can put me out on the street.

453
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,280
Do you realize how selfish you sound?

454
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,720
This building is named after your mother.

455
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,000
How can you be so ready to let it go?

456
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,840
We should be grateful
to my departed grandfather, right?

457
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,080
For giving this building to my mother.

458
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,360
What would we do if he hadn't?

459
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,440
What would you do?
What would I? What would Deva?

460
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,440
Say what you mean to say.

461
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
What is it you'd like to say, exactly?

462
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,520
Don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong.

463
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,160
See how I don't stick my nose
into your business?

464
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,440
See how I never ask about
why you got divorced from your husband?

465
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,120
See how I keep my mouth shut?
How about you try it out for once?

466
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,440
Ask me, dad.

467
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,640
Ask me. Why don't you?

468
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
Why don't you ask?

469
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,840
Ask me why Deva and I came here.

470
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,440
Ask me why he wants to get divorced.

471
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,200
Come on! But you won't, will you?

472
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
You know why you won't?

473
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:34,760
Because you hate listening
to other people's problems.

474
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,280
It's the thing you hate the most.

475
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,160
Someone telling you of their troubles.

476
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Dad...

477
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,520
You can't even bear it
when people are sick around you.

478
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,160
Remember the times
I had fevers as a kid?

479
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,600
Remember what you did?
Do you remember?

480
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,480
I'll remind you. You left.

481
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,560
You left the house.

482
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,120
I used to pray
with all my might not to get sick.

483
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,240
Not to get fevers so that my
father didn't get mad at me.

484
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,560
You didn't look after mom, either.

485
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,520
The nurses did. I did.
The doctors did.

486
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,840
But you never did.

487
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,040
You'd come to the hospital.

488
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,640
I'd tell you, "Dad, mom's dying."

489
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,160
You'd say "No."

490
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,120
"She's doing great. Mom's doing great."

491
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,280
Because that's what you want to hear.

492
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,920
Everything's great.
No problems whatsoever.

493
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,600
Everything's perfect.

494
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,320
I'll say it if it will help.
We have no problems, dad.

495
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,120
You're perfect. I'm perfect.

496
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,080
Deva's perfect.

497
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,760
Life's perfect.

498
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Good.

499
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
That's good.

500
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
Agah Beyoglu.

501
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,360
- Agah?
- Nukhet!

502
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,960
How are you?

503
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,520
I was just thinking about you.

504
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,160
<i>I was able to find some tickets</i>.

505
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,560
- Were you now?
- It's tonight. Would you like to join me?

506
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
Sure.

507
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,240
- What is it?
- We're ready.

508
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,480
I'll be right there.

509
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Hand these out to the guys.

510
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,880
Alright...

511
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
Where's Nevra?

512
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,000
She got a tip from somewhere. She went
to the courthouse to look into it.

513
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
You know Mehmet Yurtgil, the judge?

514
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,640
He was known for taking bribes.

515
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,240
She's looking into the suspects
that were wronged.

516
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,960
She thinks someone might've
took revenge on him.

517
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,520
Alright then. Anyway,

518
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,240
I have the ballistics report right here.
Here's the situation:

519
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
The gun that was used to kill
Naimhan Turedi

520
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,560
does not match the one used to kill
Mehmet Yurtgil.

521
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,480
That gun wasn't registered
anywhere. However...

522
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,040
We have some leads on the gun
that was used to kill Naimhan Turedi.

523
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,920
Someone was shot and wounded
with that gun in 2001.

524
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
The gun was seized,
and is supposed to be

525
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,080
in the Ardıchan municipality
police department's evidence locker.

526
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,320
But it's gone! Why's that?

527
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,120
Because that evidence locker
no longer exists.

528
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,680
How about...
That sleazeball you were looking into?

529
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,000
He had nothing to do with it.

530
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,960
Alright. Now...

531
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,600
The individual who did all this shit...

532
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,120
Let's call him Tufan for now.

533
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,080
Tufan gets into the evidence locker.

534
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,680
He burglarizes the locker. Then...

535
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,080
He burns the place down
to make it look like the mafia did it.

536
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,120
So he's not interested in
killing just anyone.

537
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
He's not a regular serial killer.

538
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,896
Since he's in possession of so many guns,

539
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,400
and assuming
he's not interested in selling them,

540
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
welcome to your own personal hells.

541
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,200
He's going to commit a massacre.

542
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,160
Unless we catch him first.

543
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,080
MARCH 18 SUNDAY

544
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,160
Here. Here's my resumé.

545
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,320
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
I know you're busy.

546
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,240
It's an honor to meet you.

547
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,960
This means nothing.

548
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,760
This is it.

549
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,840
- Where have you been? Austria?
- Australia.

550
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,680
I just got back.

551
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,960
You're just in time.

552
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,840
Melahat, my secretary for 20 years,

553
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,720
was retired just last week.

554
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,040
Coincidence, I guess.

555
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,880
There are no coincidences.

556
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,520
Because life itself is a coincidence.

557
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,920
A man locks the door
to his house for 99 days.

558
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,800
On the 100th day,
he forgets to lock the door.

559
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,320
The thief repents.

560
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,720
He ignores the house for those 99 days,

561
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,720
but finds the door unlocked
on the 100th day.

562
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
The days line up.

563
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,960
What do you call that?

564
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,160
A coincidence?

565
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,040
No.

566
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,080
What is it?

567
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,080
It's life.

568
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,560
You're a fast learner, Zuhal.

569
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,600
- Celik.
- Beyoglu. My surname's Beyoglu.

570
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,040
I'm getting divorced.

571
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,080
Do you know Agah Beyoglu?
Is he a relative of yours?

572
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,240
He's my father.

573
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,960
Incredible.

574
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Now this, this isn't life.
This is coincidence.

575
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,400
How is he doing? Well, I hope?

576
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,840
He's well, of course.
How do you know him?

577
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,520
From Kambura. Where else?

578
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,720
- Prosecutor?
- Did you know about this?

579
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,360
KILLER OR VICTIM?

580
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,520
I did. It was Nevra's idea.
I told her to go ahead with it.

581
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,000
That was a stupid risk to take.

582
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,520
What if Tufan gets caught
and everything is revealed?

583
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,680
What then?

584
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,120
Tufan has no connection either
to Nevra or to any of the victims.

585
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,160
That's why I approved the news article.

586
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,080
There's someone else involved.

587
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,920
Whoever it is that's helping Tufan

588
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,800
will panic when he realizes
that we're on his trail.

589
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,880
It's your call.

590
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,160
But I'm uneasy.

591
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,280
I'm not sure getting Nevra
involved in this was the right idea.

592
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,000
Do you have any better ideas? No?

593
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,000
Then we proceed.

594
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,800
Did you tell Firuz?

595
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,880
I did. He's supervising Nevra.

596
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Where's Nevra now?

597
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,640
I told her she'd be kicked
off the force if it was discovered.

598
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,720
She's lying to me. Told me
her mom was sick. Went to Kambura.

599
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,480
That's where she lives.

600
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,000
Isn't there
where the second victim was born?

601
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,920
That's right.
She could be looking into it.

602
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,920
Good. We have some leads, then.

603
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,120
We do but I can't bear the thought of
using one of my people as bait.

604
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,840
Are you having her followed?
You are. So what's the problem?

605
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,000
Look here, Tolga.

606
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,720
He's not going to
stop killing people anytime soon.

607
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,680
Who's supposed to catch him? You are.

608
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,720
What's the only lead we have? Nevra.

609
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,760
If you take Nevra off the case,

610
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,520
it won't matter whether
it was Tufan or someone else.

611
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,840
You'll never catch the murderer.

612
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,760
Someone's committing these murders
just to get Nevra to try to solve them.

613
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,120
MAYA'S COSTUME WORLD

614
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,040
Those things will kill you, you know.

615
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,080
You don't have to throw it out.
Give me one.

616
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,920
- Any leads from the courthouse?
- No.

617
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,240
I have a light.

618
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,320
My father's lighter.

619
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,960
He passed it down to me
the day he stopped smoking.

620
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,320
I asked him what I was supposed to
do with it. I didn't even smoke.

621
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,840
I picked it up that day.

622
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,600
I picked up smoking
the day my father quit. Ridiculous.

623
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,440
It was my mom that encouraged me
to smoke, actually.

624
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,200
She told me it was alright if I smoked,
but that I shouldn't be sneaky about it.

625
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,640
I didn't smoke, but I couldn't tell her.

626
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,480
I sat across from her and lit one up
just to get to spend some time with her.

627
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080
That's how I started smoking.

628
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,920
Just to do the same thing as her
at the same time as she did.

629
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,080
How is she? Better?

630
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,040
Better. She's better.

631
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,560
It must be hard,
living so far away from each other.

632
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,280
- I see her from time to time.
- Good. Don't stop seeing her.

633
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,320
My father's dead now.

634
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,440
This is all that's left of him.

635
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:56,760
MUNIR - MY LOVELY CAT

636
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,840
I'm so scared of death, Munir.

637
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,120
In fact, I'll tell you a secret.

638
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,960
I'd be OK with it
even if everyone on earth died

639
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,040
and I were the only one left.

640
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,920
I mean...

641
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,520
I'm even willing to face such loneliness.

642
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,200
What if I still remember
all I've done in the afterlife?

643
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,640
I couldn't bear that.

644
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,480
I couldn't.

645
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,800
Grandpa!

646
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,160
What are you doing?
Shut the door!

647
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,840
What...

648
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,680
What are you doing?

649
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,080
Shut the door!

650
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,040
Such bad timing.

651
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,040
Tell your mom
I have some errands to run tonight.

652
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,120
Get yourself a cell phone, please.

653
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,960
I have a phone.

654
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,880
By the way, let me introduce you guys.
Suveyda, my grandfather.

655
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,000
Nice to meet you.

656
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,760
I hope you're using protection.

657
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,400
I can't handle another child.

658
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,760
- I'm not staying.
- What are you doing?

659
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,800
What are you doing?

660
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,080
I forgot I had something to do.

661
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,040
I have something to do.
I'd forgotten. I'm not coming in.

662
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,280
You can make a u-turning
side the car park.

663
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,120
Could you tell the car behind me
to let me pass in reverse?

664
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,280
There are too many cars waiting.

665
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,840
- But I'm...
- Open up your boot, please.

666
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,160
But I'm in a hurry.
That'll be a lot of wasted time.

667
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,280
It's how the procedure works.
I don't make the rules.

668
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,320
The car doesn't run on
natural gas, I assure you.

669
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,560
I believe you, but I still have to look.
Give me your keys, please.

670
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,760
The boot's broken.
It doesn't open.

671
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:26,400
- Hand me your keys, please.
- It's broken, I'm telling you.

672
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,760
Fine. Give me a minute.

673
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,600
Broken.

674
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,600
I've tried so many times,
but it won't open.

675
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,760
- Let me try, sir.
- It won't open.

676
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,120
- But, it won't open.
- Let me try.

677
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,440
Look! You break it, you buy it.

678
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,080
- Forgive me, Hajji.
- It's fine.

679
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,720
- I have to follow the orders.
- I understand.

680
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,640
My uncle's a Hajji as well.
He just got back.

681
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,000
May Allah bless him.

682
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,920
Amen. Amen.

683
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,480
They say there's a killer on the loose.
We have strict orders.

684
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,720
How many times have I told you
there was nothing to see?

685
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,240
- Please forgive me for prying.
- It's fine.

686
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,160
Nobody believes in people anymore.

687
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,400
Such a tragedy!

688
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,560
Forgive me for being late, Nukhet.

689
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,320
I ran into so many delays.

690
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,680
- Don't mention it. You're here now.
- You look great.

691
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,480
- Thank you. So do you.
- Thank you.

692
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:52,720
- We should go in, it's about to start.
- Of course. After you.

693
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,520
- Welcome.
- Good evening.

694
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,400
- Thank you.
- Your seats are right over there.

695
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you, guys.

696
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,560
What's going on?

697
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,760
What are you doing? Who are you?

698
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,960
Answer me!

699
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,000
No mortal can take this life.

700
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,360
They can't bear it.

701
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,960
They deny everything.

702
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
They lie.

703
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,760
They keep quiet.

704
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,960
Or they throw it all up.

705
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,240
Or they plot.

706
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,280
Or they run from it.

707
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,640
<i>Or they steal</i>.

708
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,800
<i>Or they break</i>.

709
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,320
<i>Or they give birth</i>.

710
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,480
<i>Or they suffocate</i>.

711
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,880
<i>Or they get drunk</i>.

712
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,240
<i>Or they fall in love</i>.

713
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,640
Or they stop moving,

714
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,240
and die little by little.

715
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,480
They wilt.

716
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
They question.

717
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,720
<i>They get mad</i>.

718
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,880
<i>They get resentful</i>.

719
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,120
<i>They ejaculate</i>.

720
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,240
<i>They seize up</i>.

721
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,920
They believe.

722
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,560
They get created.

723
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,600
They fight.

724
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
They get wounded.

725
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,840
They try...

726
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,760
They try, and get it wrong.

727
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,080
They try,

728
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,040
and get it wrong.

729
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,320
Try and get it wrong.

730
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,960
<i>Conscience resembles the gut</i>.

731
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,040
<i>It keeps working away
even while you're asleep</i>.

732
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,840
No matter how much
you deny your conscience,

733
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,920
that horrible murder you've committed

734
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,560
always becomes the rope you get hung by.

735
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,760
It wraps around your neck,

736
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,080
the oily pieces of rope
your victim has for hands.

737
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,160
You seldom know
what it is you've murdered.

738
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,920
But you still keep hanging yourself
every night in your dreams.

739
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,880
The gut resembles the conscience.

740
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,640
If you're looking to empty it
of its contents,

741
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,960
you'll find somewhere to do it.

742
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,160
Man...

743
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,080
Tries, and gets it wrong.

744
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,960
Man tries and gets it wrong.

745
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,640
Man tries and gets it wrong.

746
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,160
Tries and gets it wrong.

747
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,440
Tries and gets it wrong.

748
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,840
Man tries and gets it wrong.

749
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,360
Tries and gets it wrong.

750
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,400
Man tries and gets it wrong.

751
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,360
Tries and gets it wrong.

752
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,720
Agah, are you alright?

753
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,520
I can't take it anymore.

754
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,120
Tries and gets it wrong.

755
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,520
This is art?

756
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,880
Sorry.

757
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,720
They call it art? What is this?

758
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,680
Tries and gets it wrong.

759
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,080
That's the first time
I've left a play before the curtain.

760
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,360
I thought it was ridiculous.

761
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,440
It's good that we left early.
I was bored out of my mind.

762
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:51,400
I've been meaning to tell you something,
but I've never found the right time.

763
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:58,320
When I came to visit you at the hospital,
your daughter Zuhal was devastated.

764
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,280
- Did she say something inconsiderate.
- No. Just the opposite.

765
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,760
She said something that moved me.

766
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,400
You told her that you were staying over at
my place that night you had your accident.

767
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,800
You said I was your girlfriend.

768
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,680
At least that's the impression
she'd gotten.

769
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,760
- What did you say?
- I said that you were with me.

770
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,640
I'm sure you had your reasons.

771
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,680
- I wouldn't speak against you.
- You're so kind.

772
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:26,920
Thank you.

773
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,960
I've been living on my own
for such a long time...

774
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,880
I've gotten used to it.

775
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,680
But it does get boring
from time to time.

776
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,120
I go out on my own sometimes,

777
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,000
but I don't want them to worry about me.

778
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,480
Forgive me for putting you
on the spot like that.

779
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,760
You know what I said to myself?

780
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,760
I wish he'd really stayed over.

781
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,440
DEAR NEVRA ELMAS, WE WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY. ARTI BANK.

782
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,560
This cake's delicious.
Did you buy it?

783
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,800
Yes, Selim. Enjoy.

784
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,360
I'll get you one on your birthday.

785
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,720
- When's that, by the way?
- Don't worry about it.

786
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,120
- About what we talked about...
- What was that?

787
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,840
That house on the hill?

788
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:37,320
Nesrin hates talking about it,
that's why I couldn't say anything.

789
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,120
But there was a tragedy there.

790
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,600
It was ten years ago.

791
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,200
You were away at college.

792
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,760
A family came and moved in
to that house on the hill.

793
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,440
Shortly thereafter,
there were a few burglaries.

794
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,440
Everybody blamed the new family.

795
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,680
One night, the people
worked themselves into a frenzy.

796
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,240
Young, old, everyone...

797
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,960
They decided to drive the family away.

798
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,080
<i>They surrounded the house</i>.

799
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:13,280
<i>Shouting, throwing rocks..</i>.

800
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:18,440
<i>The family was too scared
to come out of the house</i>.

801
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,360
<i>And then, I don't know who,
but someone threw a torch at the house</i>.

802
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,640
<i>It flared up..</i>.

803
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,480
<i>and burned the house down</i>.

804
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,040
<i>Five children inside</i>.

805
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,560
<i>And the mom and dad</i>.

806
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,040
<i>They all burned up</i>.

807
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,760
Who threw the torch?

808
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,280
<i>No one would talk</i>.

809
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,360
<i>The police interrogated all of them,
but no one would say anything</i>.

810
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,960
<i>It was completely forgotten after a while</i>.

811
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,960
<i>Everyone had stopped talking about it</i>.

812
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,840
<i>The house is still up there,
burned to a crisp</i>.

813
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,800
<i>No one even bothered to tear it down</i>.

814
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,280
<i>No one is bothered by it.
They might walk by it</i>,

815
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,360
<i>but they don't want to think about it,
so they don't even notice it</i>.

816
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,840
Was Naimhan Turedi there on that night?

817
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:16,800
Of course.

818
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,200
All his friends, his relatives,
everyone he knew was there.

819
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,840
Sefer was there.
Yakup and his uncle, as well.

820
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,160
They were drunk.

821
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,840
They'd gotten smashed at Rıza's place.

822
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,120
How do you know about it?

823
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,400
<i>It haunts my dreams</i>.

824
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,360
<i>It didn't use to</i>,

825
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,720
<i>but people change as they get older</i>.

826
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,840
Easy to say...

827
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,520
Seven people were killed.

828
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,120
The children were so small.

829
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,640
Who threw the torch, Selim?

830
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,000
I didn't see him!

831
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,800
I...

832
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,920
I only threw a single stone.

833
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,640
Is this a bad time?

834
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:58,520
TODAY IS NEVRA'S BIRTHDAY
I GOT HER A BIRTHDAY PRESENT
