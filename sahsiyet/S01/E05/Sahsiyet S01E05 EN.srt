1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,280
<i>Remember..</i>.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,160
<i>What do I do with him now</i>?

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,520
I won't let you die before
telling me why you tried to kill me.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800
<i>Conscience</i>.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,480
<i>You won't look me in the eye</i>?

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,920
Because you left that cushy job
and went and became a cop!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,520
It was ten years ago.
A family came

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,400
and moved in
to that house on the hill.

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,920
<i>There were a few burglaries</i>.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>Everybody blamed the new family</i>.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,480
<i>They burned the house down</i>.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm here now.
Looking for a job...

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,320
Here. Here's my resumÃ©.

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
- Do you know Agah Beyoglu?
- He's my father.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
<i>Ates, aren't you afraid at all
that the murderer will target you</i>?

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,520
<i>Just like he has his eyes on me</i>,

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,880
<i>I have my eyes
on the perimeter of my house</i>.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
I'm going to get that killer.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,280
<i>Wherever he runs to. Wherever he hides.
I'm going to find him, and arrest him</i>.

20
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,840
TODAY IS NEVRA'S BIRTHDAY
I GOT HER A BIRTHDAY PRESENT

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,760
You've grown older, too.

22
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,040
Hi there, Nazif. Remember me?

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,200
It's Agah.

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
From Kambura.

25
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,000
Nazif?

26
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
Hello, Nazif.

27
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,760
How are you doing, Nazif?

28
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
Pause it. He's here.

29
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,880
He jumped over the back fence.

30
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
What's that?

31
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
What is he wearing?

32
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,200
Is it supposed to be a rabbit?

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,600
No. It's a cat.

34
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,240
See its whiskers?

35
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,560
A white cat.

36
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,040
00:53.

37
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,440
When did you leave the nightclub?

38
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,040
Around 01:30.

39
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,040
I was just leaving when you called.
I'm usually done by 01:00.

40
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,320
He was keeping tabs on you.

41
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,400
There's a road that comes in
through the woods, right?

42
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,360
Yes.

43
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,720
Since he couldn't have taken
a cab in that costume...

44
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,480
With a corpse in tow, to boot.

45
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,120
He drove his own car here.
Had the corpse with him the whole way.

46
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,360
There must be a camera
recording that road.

47
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
We'll see.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
He's a lunatic.

49
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,280
Who are you?

50
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,920
Who?

51
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,080
What's he doing?

52
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
You've left the body there. Leave.

53
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
One: Take a red pen.

54
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,600
Two:

55
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
Kill Nazif.

56
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Three:

57
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
Don't forget the oud.

58
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,040
Take a red pen, kill Nazif,

59
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
don't forget the oud.

60
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,480
If Nazif isn't home,

61
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
spare his life.

62
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Yes.

63
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,080
Why did he
want to make sure that it sank?

64
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,040
- It's a surprise.
- What surprise?

65
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,480
He wanted it to be a surprise.

66
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,400
Right. I'm sorry. I didn't know
it was your birthday.

67
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,600
Of course not.

68
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,320
Happy birthday.

69
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Happy birthday to me.

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
What is he doing?

71
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
Resting.

72
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,080
Not a care in the world.
Just wants to lie down for a bit.

73
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm back.

74
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Whom do you think
the corpse belongs to, Nevra?

75
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Since it's a present...

76
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,240
It must be someone
I've been looking for.

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,600
What do we do now?

78
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
I'll call the station.

79
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,280
The Crime Scene Unit will arrive.

80
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,280
They'll go through this footage,
find out that I spent the night here,

81
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
and start avoiding me like the plague.

82
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,080
Then they'll ask both you and I
thousands of questions.

83
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,280
And finally, they'll take me off the case.

84
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,720
Followed by my resignation.

85
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,160
Or...

86
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,520
None of that will come to pass.

87
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,480
You'll delete the footage I'm in.

88
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,160
I'll rip those stickers off the balloon.

89
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,600
No one will find out that
this was meant as a present to me.

90
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,800
You'll call 155,

91
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,320
and I'll lie to everyone's faces.

92
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Then another lie, then another.

93
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,320
I'll lie so much
that I'll forget to remember them,

94
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,760
and I'll be found out sooner or later.

95
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
They'll take me off the case,
and I'll probably resign.

96
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,160
Which one sounds better to you?

97
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,880
- Which one should we go with?
- Nevra...

98
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,560
I say to myself sometimes...

99
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,560
I say...

100
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,280
What if I'd never decided to become a cop?

101
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,880
What if I never did?

102
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,680
Would he be committing these murders,

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,560
or are all these people dying
just because I chose to be a cop?

104
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
See, there you are.

105
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
He's still here.

106
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
I don't believe it.

107
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm letting you into the house,
and he's still here.

108
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,520
He forgot the bag.

109
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
KILLER OR VICTIM?

110
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,640
That's why he left it here.

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
Can you zoom it?

112
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,480
Can you zoom into the newspaper?

113
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,160
REMEMBER. REMEMBER.
REMEMBER. REMEMBER.

114
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,040
Remember...

115
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
Remember?

116
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,320
Remember what?

117
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,720
Is it meant for you?

118
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,040
Does it mean anything to you?

119
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,760
It means only one thing.

120
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,200
It's not the bag that he forgot.
He forgot to tell me to remember.

121
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,200
- Nevra...
- Yes?

122
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,600
- Are you sure?
- I am now, Ates.

123
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,640
They're being killed because I'm a cop.

124
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
And whatever it is that
he wants me to remember,

125
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,760
they'll keep dying
until I remember it.

126
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,680
Connect me to the Crime Scene Unit.

127
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,520
Where are you off to? It's still early.

128
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,160
I got some pastries.
Let's have breakfast.

129
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,640
I can't, dad.
I got a job. I have to leave.

130
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,800
- What job? Your old one?
- No. I'll tell you about it later.

131
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,120
- I'm off.
- Good luck.

132
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
- Dad...
- Yeah?

133
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,440
Let's go out to dinner tonight.

134
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,120
There's food in the fridge.

135
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
I know, not like that.

136
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,200
I want to celebrate the new job.

137
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,560
But I have errands to run.

138
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,120
What errands do you have
other than those crosswords?

139
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,760
Be home by eight
and we'll leave together.

140
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,040
School's started as well, huh?

141
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
- I don't remember how to tie it.
- I'll do it.

142
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,440
Hold these.

143
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
And this.

144
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,480
- Is she from school?
- Who?

145
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,240
Your girl. What was her name?

146
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,680
- Suveyda.
- Suveyda. That's it.

147
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
Do you know what the name means?

148
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,160
- No. Aren't you done yet?
- Patience.

149
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,400
You never wondered
what her name meant?

150
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,520
I don't think names hold any meaning.

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,040
- Why?
- Because we don't choose our own name.

152
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
Each person

153
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,000
has a black mark on their heart
when they're born, they say.

154
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
Once they find their calling in life,

155
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,920
only then does the mark fade away.

156
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,920
Suveyda is what that mark is called.

157
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,320
It does have another meaning,
but it escapes me.

158
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,360
- Let's forget about the tie.
- Hold on! Hold on!

159
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,040
I'm going to remember it.

160
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,960
It means sin. A hidden sin.

161
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,160
The sin people hide in their chests.

162
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,400
A deep, hidden sin.

163
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,560
Do you have a hidden sin in there?

164
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
I do.

165
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
- It's Suveyda.
- Right. Of course.

166
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,840
- How about in yours?
- Of course. In spades.

167
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
There you go.

168
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
You're ready to go.

169
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,000
- Thanks.
- No problem.

170
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,240
Good luck.

171
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,040
Good job, Nevra!

172
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,560
You finally caught the murderer!

173
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,320
You should get a medal or something.

174
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,720
He came to you while you were asleep.

175
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,080
I guess it's a matter of where you sleep.

176
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,680
You need to sleep in the right bed
for him to come to you.

177
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
You got him delivered.

178
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
Delivered to your address.

179
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
Great! This is great!

180
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,120
You'll pay for that, Nevra!

181
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,480
You'll pay for that!

182
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,080
Back to work!

183
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,040
Are you sick in the head or something?

184
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,000
Not only do you try to belittle her
in front of everyone at the scene,

185
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,640
and you do this!
You're making a formal complaint?

186
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,320
You deserved worse than you got!

187
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,440
- But sir...
- Shut the fuck up!

188
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,800
Get back to work!

189
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,560
So... Dear Ates Arbay.
Let's get down to business.

190
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,920
Who is your source for all these articles,

191
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,120
and what do you give them in return?

192
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,600
I don't give anyone anything.

193
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,040
I have sources,

194
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,120
and I don't have to tell you
who they are.

195
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,160
<i>Sources..</i>.

196
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,440
<i>I see. Alright</i>.

197
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,760
You see, Ates Arbay,
this is dangerous business.

198
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,640
Whoever is selling you the case files

199
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,920
might want something
more precious in return very soon.

200
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,280
They might get greedy.
They might sell you down the river.

201
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,160
What did I tell you?

202
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Follow her every move.

203
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,360
Shadow her wherever she goes.

204
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,440
I'm not sure you're fully aware.

205
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,880
If you'd done your job,
we'd have the killer by now!

206
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,360
Sir, may I please speak?

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,400
Go ahead, speak.

208
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,920
She went over to her mom's
place last night.

209
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,400
AnÄ±l was on her. He called me
to ask what he should do.

210
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,320
- His son was sick, so I let him go home.
- Great fucking decision!

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,160
You're off the fucking case, alright?

212
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,480
Sefa will handle it now.

213
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,840
And take that complaint
and stick it up your ass!

214
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,560
<i>- Welcome.
- Shut up</i>.

215
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,840
Why are you mad at me?
I'm on your side.

216
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,600
I told you to shut up.

217
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,000
- Why am I here?
- Don't speak unless spoken to.

218
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm the victim here.

219
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,480
The killer came into my home
and left a body in my garden.

220
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,960
Still, here you are, interrogating me.
Shouldn't you be out looking for him?

221
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
What are you going to do?
Hit me?

222
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
Go ahead.

223
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
Hit me.

224
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
Ates Arbay.

225
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,240
My whole career, I've never touched a hair
on anyone's head in this room.

226
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,600
But if you know something
about the case and are hiding it from us,

227
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
then I'll knock you into
the middle of next week.

228
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,480
And one more thing.

229
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,360
You're not on our side, Ates Arbay.

230
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,680
You know what side you're on?

231
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,520
The side where desk warriors
mess with other people's lives.

232
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,840
That's the side you're on.

233
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,560
You know what I call
the people on that side?

234
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,280
I call them jesters.

235
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,600
We don't mess with people's lives here.

236
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,520
We save their lives instead.
You got that?

237
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,560
I understand.

238
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,440
Do you think he does, as well?

239
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Get him out of here. Out. Out!

240
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,280
- One red pen, as well.
- Of course.

241
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,080
- Duct tape.
- I've already given you some.

242
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,280
Another one.

243
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,200
- And some sticky note cards.
- Post-its?

244
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,480
Whatever they're called.
Give me some.

245
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,360
Sit down. Sit!

246
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,240
This has to be a joke!
It has to be!

247
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,920
- Are you Ates Arbay's source?
- No, sir.

248
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,720
- Who is it, then?
- I don't know.

249
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,560
- He didn't tell you?
- He didn't.

250
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,080
Do you trust that man?

251
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,680
It doesn't matter.

252
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,800
There will be a press conference tonight.

253
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,840
The killer turned out not to be
the killer. Everyone's in a frenzy.

254
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,800
I want you at the press conference.
Don't go anywhere. Now get out.

255
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,240
- That's it?
- That's it.

256
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,400
You don't have any other questions?

257
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,480
The mistakes you make
in your private life is your business.

258
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,160
Just don't make those
same mistakes when you're at work.

259
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,080
Will you take me off the case?

260
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Nevra, get out.

261
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,240
Wait a second.
Whom did this belong to?

262
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Darn it.

263
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,720
See? Red's much better.

264
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,640
More distinctive.

265
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,360
Easier to see.

266
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
Alright...

267
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,160
What's this?

268
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,960
KILL

269
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
I'll never forget now.

270
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,520
Good afternoon, Hasan.

271
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,600
Won't you take my order?

272
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,680
Selim...

273
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,440
- How are you?
- Fine, Vural. How about you?

274
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,600
- I'm not great, to be honest.
- Why's that?

275
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,840
You're talking too much...

276
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
I hear you've been blabbering.

277
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,280
What are you saying?

278
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,280
Telling people
it was haunting your dreams.

279
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,080
What use is it, talking to people
about your dreams, Selim?

280
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,840
Something might happen to you.

281
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,640
And then, when the cops come
and ask them what happened to you,

282
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
no one might feel inclined to talk.

283
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,680
It's best if you didn't talk.

284
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,840
Especially to Nevra.

285
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,560
You should really tread lightly.

286
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,160
Selim!

287
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Auntie! Auntie!

288
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,360
- Let the boys carry those for you.
- Thank you, Vural.

289
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,160
- Doing well, I hope?
- Doing well.

290
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,920
Stop by for some tea sometime.

291
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,360
Can I help you with anything?

292
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,680
I'm fine, thank you so much.

293
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,880
Say hi to your mom for me, though.

294
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,640
Of course. You're too kind.
Have a nice day.

295
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,680
What can I get you, brother?

296
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,040
MISSING SUSPECT

297
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,640
VICTIM

298
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Victim.

299
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,240
- Now, boys...
- Tolga, give me a moment.

300
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,760
Nevra, we already know that these murders
have something to do with you.

301
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,880
This is not a matter of mistaken identity.

302
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,480
You are the Nevra
the victim is alluding you, as you know.

303
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,880
Since, as a matter of protocol,

304
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,120
we don't allow officers to work cases
they're personally involved in,

305
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,480
I didn't want you to take up the case.

306
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,160
Neither did your superior, Tolga.

307
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,360
Suspecting that the murderer
wasn't stopping anytime soon,

308
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,000
I asked Tolga for a favor.

309
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,480
I asked him to keep you on this case.

310
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,240
Because you were the only connection
to the killer that we could find.

311
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,640
And you still are.

312
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,760
It was now
Tolga's turn to ask me for a favor.

313
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,200
He asked me to share all this with you.

314
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,920
But I refused.

315
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,680
Because rule one of my job
is that you don't trust anyone.

316
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,240
If the murderer getting caught

317
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,280
would expose some secrets
you wouldn't want exposed,

318
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,480
we had to find out what they might be.

319
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,200
That's why we kept you in the dark.

320
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,960
That's why we had you followed.

321
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
Tolga even told you

322
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,280
that if you were the Nevra
from the stickers,

323
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,160
you'd be taken off the case.

324
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,040
Why am I telling me all this now,
you might ask.

325
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,480
Because rule two of my job

326
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,880
is to recognize
when someone's trustworthy.

327
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,080
Even though you knew fully well
that you'd be taken off the case,

328
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,280
you still didn't tamper with the evidence.

329
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Happy birthday, by the way.

330
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,920
I assume you understand
why all this subterfuge was necessary.

331
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,560
As you well know,

332
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,880
this is the first killing spree
of this magnitude in our country.

333
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,280
This is an exceptional case.

334
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,600
It required exceptional measures.

335
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,120
You know everything now.

336
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,880
The choice is yours to make.

337
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,240
Both your superior
and I want you on this case.

338
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,720
But if you wanted to excuse yourself,
I'd understand.

339
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,880
Make a choice.
Are you in or out?

340
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,280
- I'm in, of course.
- Good.

341
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,080
Nevra...

342
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,720
There's no more playing cowboy.

343
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,320
You'll be partnering with Sefa.

344
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,640
You'll be reporting to me every day.
Are we clear?

345
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,320
We are, sir.

346
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
Shit.

347
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,520
NEVRA AND I HAVE A SECRET

348
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,160
What were you doing here, then?

349
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,760
- Out for a picnic.
- Just out for a picnic.

350
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,080
Out for a picnic.

351
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,240
Foreign-made.
No one can crack it.

352
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,120
Just pick a password and you're done.

353
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Take care not to forget the password.

354
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,120
See? They tampered with the door also.

355
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,960
- I can fix it if you'd like.
- No need. It's fine.

356
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,120
They broke into a house
in the neighborhood.

357
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,560
When they couldn't find anything
to steal, they took a bath.

358
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,960
- A bath?
- Yeah. Oh, and they stole some flowers.

359
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,760
- What would they do with flowers?
- I don't know, smell them or something.

360
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
Do you live alone here?

361
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,480
Why do you ask?

362
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,280
The world isn't as innocent
as it used to be back in your time.

363
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,080
What do you mean?

364
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
They keep tabs on old people.

365
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,680
Don't you worry about that.
Old people keep tabs on them, also.

366
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,960
Can I ask you a question?

367
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,080
Why are the mechanics always late?

368
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,800
Excuse me?

369
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,320
<i>Tufan Elibol, the murder suspect
in the serial killer investigatio</i>n

370
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,960
<i>was found dead in the back garden
of famous reporter Ates Arbay's house</i>.

371
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,760
<i>The case seems to be out of control</i>.

372
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,960
<i>Hoping to ease the public's concerns</i>,

373
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,800
<i>the police department is planning to hold
a press conference sometime today</i>.

374
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,560
Do you think this has a deeper meaning?
Seeing two corpses

375
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,560
wrapped up in cling film
inside one day?

376
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,480
It signals good fortunes.

377
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,720
Why do you think
he packages them up like this?

378
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,960
He packaged Tufan up
because he was a present for me.

379
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,960
- So he follows protocol, you think?
- Sure.

380
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,920
He must not have wanted
the animals to get to this one.

381
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,320
Do you think he cares about
what happens to the bodies?

382
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,240
No.

383
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,000
But he does care about the messages.

384
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,120
He don't want something happen to them
before we get the chance to read them.

385
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,800
NEVRA AND I HAVE A SECRET

386
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,040
They're everywhere.

387
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,440
We are gathered here to celebrate
a proud giant of Turkish industry,

388
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,960
the 73-year-old company,

389
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,440
Tezgider Textiles,

390
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,640
merging with Havran Holding Company.

391
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,360
No... That's too long a sentence.

392
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,920
- Edit it for me, will you?
- Of course.

393
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,880
If Nazif isn't home, spare his life.

394
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,400
Who is it?

395
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
I must have the wrong door, I'm sorry.

396
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,280
- Agah? Is that you?
- Yes?

397
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,520
It's Nazif! You don't recognize me?

398
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,520
- Nazif?
- Hold on.

399
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,640
- It's Nazif!
- How's that possible?

400
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,400
Come here, you heartbreaker.
Come on, come on in.

401
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,520
Wait...

402
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,960
It's really you, Agah!
How long has it been?

403
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,400
Must've been twenty years.
Maybe even more.

404
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,320
Agah...

405
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,680
Darling...

406
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,480
You don't need to feel threatened.

407
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,000
It's me, Nazif!

408
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,960
Actually, I've been going by Naz
for 16 years,

409
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,920
but you can address me
however you feel comfortable.

410
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,400
So? How's Mebrure?
She's well, I hope.

411
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,880
Mebrure passed away, sadly.

412
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,760
Ten years ago.

413
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,480
Oh, dear.

414
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,520
May she rest in peace.

415
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,960
She was such a beautiful woman.
She had a pure heart.

416
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,080
Come on, take off that coat.

417
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,960
Sit back, get comfortable.

418
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,040
This is fine, Mr... Naz.

419
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,480
We don't need to call each other
mister and missus.

420
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,240
That's good to hear, Naz.

421
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,240
- My mother's passed on, as well, Agah.
- May she rest in peace.

422
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
You'd been to this house before, right?

423
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,760
We came to visit you
after you were assigned to Istanbul.

424
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,600
Yes, I remember now.
I left that job, as you know.

425
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,720
I know.

426
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,080
We haven't seen each other since.

427
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,800
Yes, we haven't...

428
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,560
Agah...

429
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,920
Come on.

430
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Look here.

431
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,120
Look into my eyes.

432
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,360
That's better.
I'm the same person, Agah.

433
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,440
I'm your old friend. Alright?

434
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,720
It's for...

435
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,920
I have a skin condition.

436
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,440
I have to wear a cream.
Doctor's orders.

437
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,840
- I hope you get better.
- Thank you.

438
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Agah, I have an idea.

439
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,360
Let's have some raki!

440
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,960
The reporters will have
a million questions.

441
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,080
We have to get our story straight.

442
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,720
Nevra, wrap the case up for me.

443
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,120
The last victim's name was Salih Guden.
No priors. 51 years old. Truck driver.

444
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
Nevra...

445
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
From the beginning.

446
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,600
Mehmet Yurtgil. Judge.
Heavy penal court.

447
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
He had a reputation for taking bribes,
but we have no proof of it.

448
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,320
Naimhan Turedi.

449
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,320
He's a man that sung at taverns.

450
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,880
No priors.

451
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,080
But Naimhan and I share something.

452
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,360
Kambura.

453
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,000
He's from Kambura.
Lived there until he was 20.

454
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
My family lived in Kambura, as well.

455
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,800
<i>My mom worked at the post office</i>.

456
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,280
<i>She was assigned to Kambura
when I was nine</i>.

457
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,920
<i>We stayed there for a year,
until she was assigned to another town</i>.

458
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,920
<i>I never went back to Kambura</i>,

459
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,800
<i>but my mom loved that town so much
that she moved there after she retired</i>.

460
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,760
<i>- Got married there, in fact.
- You don't have to mention that</i>.

461
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,800
And then, there's Tufan.

462
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,360
Tufan has no connection
whatsoever to Kambura.

463
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,840
However, three days before
Mehmet Yurtgil was killed,

464
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,040
the ArdÄ±chan Courthouse
was burned down.

465
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,160
That's where he got the guns.

466
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,080
He also took whatever illegal items
he could find in the evidence locker.

467
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,080
He could be in possession
of drugs and explosives.

468
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,640
We're still waiting on the inventory list
to know exactly what he took.

469
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,920
Why the ArdÄ±chan Courthouse?

470
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,360
I can't wrap my head around that.
Why not another courthouse but that one?

471
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,480
Nevermind. Keep going.

472
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,000
He also took the case files
in the courthouse.

473
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,960
He needed someone
to pin the murders on.

474
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,800
He had to be someone with a record

475
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,920
so that we'd quickly identify him
as the killer,

476
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,800
buying the real killer time
to commit the other murders.

477
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,360
He found Tufan from those case files.
An ex-con jailed for killing his wife.

478
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,040
He probably kidnapped Tufan
after burning down the courthouse,

479
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,160
and planted his fingerprints
on the stickers.

480
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,360
By the way...

481
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,320
The stickers and the card
we found on Tufan bore no fingerprints.

482
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:42,640
<i>- Now, this heavy penal judge...
- Mehmet Yurtgil</i>.

483
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,960
<i>Yes</i>.

484
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,040
<i>Does he have any connections
to Kambura</i>?

485
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,840
<i>No, sir. At least none we've found so far</i>.

486
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,360
<i>How about the third victim,
Salih Guden, the truck driver</i>?

487
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,880
He's not from Kambura,

488
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,400
but he's been going there for work
for years. So yes, he might.

489
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,720
Alright, then.

490
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,400
Three victims. Scratch Tufan.
Two of them are from Kambura.

491
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,280
You've lived in Kambura for a while.
That counts as a lead, don't you think?

492
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
So all this does have something
to do with Kambura.

493
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,840
But why did he let Tufan go?

494
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,080
Why did he want us to find Tufan?

495
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,920
That must be Timur.
He's doing the autopsy on Tufan.

496
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,560
- Do you have anything, Timur?
- The whole body was soaked in bleach.

497
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,160
<i>No traces of DNA on him</i>.

498
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,440
<i>But he does have soft tissue trauma
on his wrists and ankles</i>.

499
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,600
<i>He was kept tied up for a prolonged time</i>.

500
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,200
<i>And I don't know if it means anything,
but they fed him cat food</i>.

501
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,000
<i>I found cat food in his stomach</i>.

502
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,720
SUSPECT

503
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,200
How is this possible?

504
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,360
I really had no idea.

505
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,080
I did everything I could
to keep it from you guys.

506
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,080
You've been with women
before, haven't you?

507
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,120
I have. It's really hard
not to doubt your true feeling.

508
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,880
It's so scary, it feels like
your whole world might come down.

509
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,640
That's why I always
tried to convince myself

510
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,080
that what I was feeling wasn't real.

511
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,720
It's a way of deceiving yourself, really.

512
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,560
I went to bed with so many women
just to prove myself to others.

513
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,520
It's not like I was able to have sex
with any of them, though.

514
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,240
There was this one girl...

515
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,720
She was beautiful.
I can't remember her name. Whatever.

516
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,240
That bastard Sungur
used to pimp them out, remember?

517
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,880
I do.

518
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,800
She cried. The thought of me
not liking her was devastating for her.

519
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,280
She thought I'd go back to Sungur
and tell him I didn't like her.

520
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,160
She was scared he'd beat her up.

521
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,280
Actually, when I think back...

522
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,160
She was the first person I ever told.

523
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,120
She was the first person I confessed to.

524
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,840
I told her I didn't really like women.

525
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,080
That's all I have for you.
My story ends there.

526
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,600
Time to tell yours.

527
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,120
What brings you to my home?

528
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Nazif...

529
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
I'm sorry, Naz...

530
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,320
You say it so beautifully!

531
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,640
Say my name again.

532
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,160
Naz...

533
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
- Yes, dear?
- I'm sick.

534
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,440
Early stages of Alzheimer's.

535
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,280
Sadly... I'll forget everything.

536
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,160
Everything.

537
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,800
So I told myself...

538
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,960
That before I forgot...

539
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,640
I should visit my old friends.

540
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,360
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

541
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,880
Oh, darling.

542
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,280
Agah...

543
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,760
You know what we're going to do now?

544
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,720
Do you remember that night
when we got drunk

545
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
and wrote a song together?

546
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,960
Yes?

547
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,600
- I still have it on paper.
- No way.

548
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,760
See?

549
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,120
That's really something.
It was in the key of Segah?

550
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,200
No, not Segah!

551
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,560
Agah...

552
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,360
It's in the key of Agah.

553
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,880
I have the oud right here.

554
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,120
<i>No more nightingales
No more roses</i>.

555
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,200
<i>The pain inside Is all I hav</i>e

556
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,720
<i>I can't go on Any longer</i>.

557
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,360
<i>Oh, lover, lover, Please end me</i>.

558
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,400
<i>I can't go on Any longer</i>.

559
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,080
<i>Oh, lover, lover, Please end me</i>.

560
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,800
<i>Ah..</i>.

561
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,840
<i>Alas..</i>.

562
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,680
<i>In the key of Agah..</i>.

563
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,240
<i>I wasted my life..</i>.

564
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,720
<i>I've gone mad</i>!

565
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
<i>Gone mad</i>!

566
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,520
- We used to have so much fun.
- Those were the days.

567
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,480
We used to recite poems.
From NazÄ±m, from Yahya Kemal...

568
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,640
- Cheers to those days, Agah.
- Cheers to young times past.

569
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,520
Shut up! We're still young!

570
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,800
Sure we are.
How many glasses does this make?

571
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,160
I'm pretty drunk.

572
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,440
I haven't seen you for ages.
Stop whining!

573
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,800
You know what I thought?

574
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,280
I thought that once I became a woman,

575
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,200
all my troubles would go away.
I'd finally be happy.

576
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,160
I did become happy.

577
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,160
But I'd forgotten about a detail.

578
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,600
Something was missing, Agah.

579
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,360
You can't live without love.

580
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,840
Nothing works
when you don't have love.

581
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,160
Without love,

582
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,160
no more nightingales...

583
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,440
No more roses.

584
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,960
I'm so unhappy, Agah!

585
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,920
I'm so alone!

586
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,160
No one's knocked on that door for years!

587
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,160
But I don't care!
I still dress up every night!

588
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,440
It works, you see?
You finally came!

589
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,240
It was so good of you to come!

590
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,480
Maybe you didn't come to say goodbye.

591
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,200
Maybe you came to say hello!

592
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,520
A little birdie told me...

593
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,920
That there's something about your past
that you just can't shake.

594
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Might that be me?

595
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,680
You have a drop...

596
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,240
of raki right there.

597
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,160
Let me drink my fill.

598
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,160
Whose poem is that?

599
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,360
Mine.

600
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,680
For you.

601
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,600
Agah...

602
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,480
What the...

603
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Shit!

604
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
What's this?

605
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,400
What did you do, Agah?

606
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
What did you do!

607
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,560
Die, you bastard!

608
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,440
Come here!

609
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,080
Don't!

610
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,760
Don't hurt the instrument!

611
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,280
Don't! Don't!

612
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
Don't!

613
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,040
Don't...

614
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,080
I'll show you!

615
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,320
That's all the information I have for you.
I have summed up the situation for now.

616
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,560
We will keep sharing our information
with the public in the coming days.

617
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,000
Lastly, for our citizens
who live in Istanbul's immediate vicinity,

618
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,080
<i>there's no reason to panic.
We are on the case</i>.

619
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,080
<i>Chiefly the Murder Bureau</i>,

620
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,440
<i>but in fact the whole police force</i>,

621
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,800
<i>is working to solve the murders
and bring swift justice on the murderer</i>.

622
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,120
<i>Our citizens can rest easy</i>.

623
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,640
<i>Whoever it is
that is committing these murder</i>s

624
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,440
<i>will soon be caught and tried</i>.

625
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,080
<i>You don't need to doubt that</i>.

626
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,480
<i>I'll be taking questions shortly</i>,

627
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,520
<i>but since the case, as you know,
involves sensitive information</i>,

628
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,160
<i>I might have to refrain
from answering some of your questions</i>.

629
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,120
<i>I ask for your understanding</i>.

630
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,360
Sir! Sir!

631
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,600
- Go ahead.
- Does the cat costume signify anything?

632
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,240
- Do you think it might be a message?
- He's definitely an animal lover.

633
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,160
But as you all know, Hitler was in love
with his dogs. Any other questions?

634
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,800
You do realize!

635
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,920
That you've been up there for an hour
without saying anything.

636
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,240
Four people were killed
inside a single week.

637
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,880
People are scared to leave their homes.

638
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,560
And all you have to say...

639
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,120
To allay their fears...

640
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,600
Is that you're working on it.

641
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,040
As all the reporters gathered here
and the millions watching on TV know,

642
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,240
a government official
saying he's working on it

643
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,680
means they are not doing anything.

644
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,480
If you were making any real progress,
you'd have shared that with us.

645
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,200
You have nothing to show for your efforts.

646
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,240
Ates Arbay, right?

647
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Are you done?

648
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
Good.

649
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,000
Gathered here...

650
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,640
are countless reporters
with spotless records.

651
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,440
I will defer to them
on the legitimacy of your work.

652
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,240
But I condemn you for your words
that defame me and my department.

653
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,240
Do you really not have anything?

654
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,560
Don't you have any leads?

655
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:56,520
Please calm down!
I get it, you're concerned.

656
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,320
And you have a right to be.

657
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
That's why I'll be sharing
another information with you.

658
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,680
The murder suspect used Tufan Elibol
to throw us off his trail.

659
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:12,920
But Tufan Elibol's body
contained useful evidence.

660
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,040
You made me do it, Agah!

661
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,560
<i>Tufan Elibol, whom the killer used
to throw us off his scen</i>t

662
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,360
<i>will prove instrumental
in the killer getting caught</i>.

663
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,240
<i>The killer has made his bed</i>.

664
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,040
A bomb goes off, killing 50 people,
and you don't panic.

665
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,560
But when people are picked off
one by one, then you do. Is that it?

666
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,680
One thing we know is that the killer
doesn't torture his victims, right?

667
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,440
He hasn't so far, yes.

668
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,960
We're over here, dad!

669
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,280
- Cemil?
- Look who I've brought.

670
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,280
- I told you he'd recognize me.
- Come here!

671
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:56,960
I see you all over on TV, in newspapers.
Of course I recognized you.

672
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,720
- You're truly your own man now!
- You haven't changed a bit!

673
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,880
- I'm getting old.
- I won't hear it. You look incredible!

674
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,000
Come on. I'm getting old.

675
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,200
How do you know each other?

676
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,520
I've met Zuhal really recently.
As of today, she works for me.

677
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,080
You didn't tell me.

678
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,960
I really love him, you know.
I knew him as a child, back in Kambura.

679
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,440
Such a nice surprise!

680
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,280
- Hi, by the way.
- Hi.

681
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,480
Such a nice surprise!

682
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,280
So? How are you doing, Cemil?

683
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,840
He seems to exhibit

684
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,560
none of the obsessions
and sexual fantasies of serial killers.

685
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,960
We don't know whether
he enjoys the act of killing or not.

686
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,520
He seems to be a simple murderer.

687
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,040
They usually have only two motives:
Either money or revenge.

688
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,920
Since he's never stolen anything,
he must be after revenge.

689
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,040
<i>He has so many people to take revenge on
that it turns him into a serial killer</i>.

690
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,120
<i>Not just three or four people</i>.

691
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,080
<i>Maybe ten..</i>.

692
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
<i>Maybe 20</i>.

693
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,400
<i>Maybe even more</i>.

694
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,000
<i>And then there're the messages</i>.

695
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,440
All meant for me.

696
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,080
I mean...

697
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,840
He leaves clues for the police.

698
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,120
But why?

699
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,880
Why does he do it?

700
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,320
Ten years ago, a crowd,
I don't know how many people yet,

701
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,160
gathered outside this house
and burned it to the ground.

702
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,400
How did you find out about this?
Who told you?

703
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,520
Selim, my mom's current husband told me.

704
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,560
He was here too, sadly.

705
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,880
Selim says that
a single person threw the torch,

706
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,520
but he never saw who.

707
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:07,120
But from what I gather,
no one ran in to help the people inside.

708
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,280
That night, seven people died in the fire.

709
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,160
A mother, a father, and five children.

710
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,360
And most importantly,
at least according to Selim,

711
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,680
one of the victims
was in the crowd that night.

712
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,320
Naimhan.

713
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,000
The man you told me about,

714
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,200
the one you chased all the way here...

715
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,520
- You never saw his face?
- No, I couldn't!

716
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,960
It was dark.

717
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,240
I never saw his face, but I'm certain
that he wanted to bring me here.

718
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,080
He brought me here,
and asked me to remember.

719
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,720
I've been here for three years.
This is the first I'm hearing of this.

720
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,000
That's strange. You never wondered
why and how it happened?

721
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
No.

722
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,080
Good for you.

723
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,000
Turn on the computer.
I want to take a look at the archives.

724
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,240
Um...

725
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,120
Um?

726
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,240
The archives are in here.

727
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,280
What have you been doing
for the past three years?

728
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,480
Waiting to get assigned to another town.

729
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,360
Go wait over there, then.
Come on in, Nevra.

730
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,880
I don't believe it.

731
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,040
<i>He's such a humble man</i>.

732
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,360
We've been talking for hours,
and he hasn't mentioned

733
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,280
all he's done even once.

734
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,800
What have I done?

735
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,800
Don't be coy.

736
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,640
I was orphaned at the age of nine, Zuhal.

737
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,520
My father died suddenly.

738
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,520
My mother was a wretch.

739
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,360
She was always sick, too.
We were left all alone.

740
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,760
You know who took care of us?

741
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,360
<i>Kambura did</i>.

742
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,280
<i>Kamburans</i>.

743
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,440
<i>They bought me school supplies</i>.

744
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,400
<i>They dressed me</i>.

745
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,680
Even the poorest among them
found a way to get my mom some money.

746
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,360
They all wanted me
to become learned. So I did.

747
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:29,200
I could've never come to Istanbul
to go to college if it weren't for them.

748
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,840
And your father here,

749
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,760
paid for a tutor for me,

750
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,680
even though
he was just a civil servant.

751
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,720
You paid for my tutor year after year.

752
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,800
Come on, forget about it.

753
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,920
- Anyone would've done the same.
- No.

754
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,160
I've never forgotten, Agah.

755
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,400
I owe a lot to Kambura and to you.

756
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,800
You don't owe anyone anything.

757
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,000
You can't imagine how happy I was when
I found out that Zuhal was your daughter.

758
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,560
But I'm telling you now,
with Zuhal as my witness,

759
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,440
that if you need anything at all,
I want you to tell me about it.

760
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,560
I'll be deeply hurt if you don't.

761
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,400
Sure. Of course. I will.

762
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,840
I'm serious. You know I mean it.

763
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,840
<i>I know</i>.

764
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,120
<i>You're a good man</i>.

765
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,360
<i>You were back then</i>,

766
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,200
<i>and you still are</i>.

767
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,800
KILL

768
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,320
Nevra, I found it.

769
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,800
What?

770
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,640
You have the reports?

771
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,240
Nevra, no one burned it down.

772
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,480
What do you mean, no one did?

773
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,960
Here's the report.
The cause for the fire was a cigarette.

774
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,000
There were two gas lamps inside the house.
That's why the fire grew out of control.

775
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,240
But there was a crowd gathered outside.

776
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:25,840
Yes, they did.
It's written in the police report.

777
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,280
"The locals gathered around the house"

778
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:33,920
and did their best to control the fire
before the fire department arrived.

779
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,080
However, despite the locals' efforts,

780
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,440
the seven people inside the house,
probably asleep at the time,

781
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,160
"were unable to be rescued alive."

782
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,640
Nevra, those people
didn't gather there to start a fire.

783
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,600
They gathered there
to rescue the ones inside.

784
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,880
But Selim told me otherwise.

785
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,440
He was there.
He saw it with his own eyes.

786
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:01,160
No. I wasn't there at the time.

787
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,400
But Selim,

788
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,520
you told me
you threw a stone at the house.

789
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,280
You told me it haunted your dreams.

790
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,960
Exactly. It's nothing but a dream.

791
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,000
He confuses them with reality.

792
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,240
He goes off the rails
when he neglects his meds.

793
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,720
They came all the way from Istanbul
hoping to find something.

794
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,080
You should be more thoughtful.

795
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,920
Sugar?
