buying the real killer time to commit the other murders.

他从这些案卷中找到了图凡  一名前诈骗犯  因杀害妻子而入狱

478

你已经在坎布拉住了一段时间了  那算是个线索，对吗？

492
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
So all this does have something to do with Kambura.

493
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,840
But why did he let Tufan go?

494
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,080
Why did he want us to find Tufan?

495
