你知道對一個謀殺專家來說最危險的是什麼嗎?

300
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
Obsession.
癡迷

301
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
You get an idea.
你有個主意

302
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,400
Then you start believing it. It takes hold in your mind.
然後你就開始相信它了

303
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,240
Then it turns into an obsession. It blinds you.
然後變成迷戀  它蒙蔽你的雙眼

304
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
You can always have theories, of course.
當然，你總是可以有理論的

305
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,160
But do you know the difference between a theory and a conspiracy?

306
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll tell you that, as well.
我也可以告訴你

307
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,880
Theories are smart.
理論很明智

308
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Conspiracy theories are sicknesses.
陰謀論是疾病

309
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,560
Because the evidence for a theory is rooted in truth.

310
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,920
But the evidence for a conspiracy is another conspiracy theory.

311
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,440
Itself, in other words.
換句話說，陰謀本身

312
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,920
It's right even when it's wrong.
即使錯了也是對的

313
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,760
A conspiracy theory is never wrong.
陰謀論永遠不會錯

314
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
You know who else is never wrong?
你知道還有誰永遠不會錯嗎？

315
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,120
Dumb people.
愚蠢的人

316
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,600
Don't get me wrong. I'm not only talking about you, talking about myself, as well.
不要誤會我的意思，我不僅是在說你，也在說我自己

317
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,720
That's why we're going to build a perimeter of logic together.
這就是為什麼我們要一起構建邏輯邊界

318
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,520
We'll keep running into each other. Until we find the truth.
我們會經常碰麵  直到我們找到真相

319
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,920
We will consider every single possibility.

320
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,360
Even the possibility that none of this has anything to do with Kambura.

-是誰？-他身上冇有身份證

我冇有和他說話  等著你來，塞米爾

You made up for it, though.

- Is that so? - Yes.

335
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
