Do you know where Hamza is now?

如今，感恩已是一個逐漸消失的概念，我也不知道他在哪裏

那個叫哈姆薩的罪犯逃離了讓他越獄的人

Because I knew you'd fail with Ufuk,

I decided to take matters into my own hands.

Maybe he changed his mind. I don't know.

Isn't it possible that he regretted it?

It's not that easy, taking a life.

Well, Zuhal, that depends on whom you're killing.

459
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480

我也問了消防員和警察  他們說法都一樣
