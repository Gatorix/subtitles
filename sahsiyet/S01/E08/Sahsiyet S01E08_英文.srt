1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,720
Remember...

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,560
The date was April 12th.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,200
The space shuttle
is about to be launched. Vostok 1.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,680
He used to launch shuttles,
but still no one comes around.

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,240
A STAR FELL FROM THE SKY

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,840
I MADE A WISH

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,720
I WISHED THEY ALL DIED

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,160
<i>Mom, I need to ask you something</i>.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,040
Why did you lie that day?

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,160
You and Selim, when I asked you
how that house burned down?

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,000
Why would I lie?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,760
You're going to make a decision.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,960
<i>Will I see your face again</i>?

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,440
<i>It's Firuz! Don't shoot!
I'm coming out</i>!

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,240
I was on night duty when a man came by.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>I remember everything he said to me</i>.

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,080
"You will forget about this.
Or you will disappear," he said.

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,120
- Tell me you're letting me go.
- Let's say I let you go.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,320
Will everything you've done
all these years also let you go?

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,160
<i>I asked you if you're mafia, son</i>!

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
<i>Yeah. We are. So what</i>?

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,120
Good. Here's your mafia.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,880
PERSONAL

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,520
Bro...

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,160
This is an incredible idea, Deva.

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,600
- You see it, right?
- Yeah. I see it.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
How many people have written in?

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,400
It's as if they've waited
their whole lives for this moment.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,320
Waiting for someone
to ask them their opinion.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,240
There are some great replies here.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,880
Here are some. Listen up.

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,800
Whom would you like Dog Slayer to kill?

33
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,080
<i>He should kill the people
who sit around on park benches</i>,

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,120
<i>eating nuts
and scattering trash everywhere</i>.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,440
<i>Here's another one</i>.

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,800
<i>Wouldn't it be great if he killed
the ones who refuse to stop honking</i>?

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
It would be.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Here's another one.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
You know how
when you're waiting in line

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,560
<i>and the person behind you
is standing too close to you</i>?

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
<i>He should kill them
so we can finally breathe</i>.

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
Let me see.

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
"Dear Dog Slayer..."

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,880
My mom forbade me
from going on the internet

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,800
"because I'm doing bad at school.
Could you please kill my mom?"

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,960
- So it says.
- He wants him to kill his mom?

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,080
It seems so. Look at his nickname.

48
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,720
Vengeful generation.

49
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,080
So this Mehmet Yurtgil went to the doctor.

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,640
He threatened the doctor
and shut him up by scaring him.

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
And then, he forces him
to write this report about Ufuk.

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

53
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,800
And the first victim
is this Mehmet Yurtgil.

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,600
You remember when I told you that
I'd picked you from among 50 women?

55
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,160
Thank you for not letting me down.
I have another thing to thank you on.

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,440
The other day,
when we were talking in my room

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
and I told you that what's happening
might have nothing to do with Kambura...

58
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,040
You know how you asked me for the file?
How you didn't give up on it?

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,280
Thank you for that, as well.

60
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,040
Good job. We're getting closer.

61
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
What did the good sir write this time?

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,200
They all had
the same word written on them.

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,520
"Personal."

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,400
"Personal." So he killed them
for his own reasons, huh?

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,720
- Seems so.
- Then...

66
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,200
Whom did he kill all these people for?
Who are they?

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,600
Chief, these men had 80 priors.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Accessory. Forgery.
Their rap sheet is something to behold.

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,240
But they're not connected to Kambura.
No fingerprints, either.

70
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,600
But the crime was caught on CCTV.

71
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,880
Let me guess. Cat costume.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Yes.

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,720
We were able to follow him a long while
through neighborhood shops' cameras.

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,200
He went in and out of a few streets.

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,320
He acted like he wasn't sure
which way he was supposed to be headed.

76
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,960
He went into a construction site, because
that whole area is a construction site

77
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
and there are no cameras looking inside,
we lost the suspect.

78
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,296
We lost him because of
the urban transformation project.

79
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
He had his escape planned.

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,040
Those construction sites are like
black holes in the middle of our cities.

81
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,520
This is bad. This is really bad.

82
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,640
This is really bad.
Everyone's getting on the ride.

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,760
Whoever has a bone to pick
will shoot, kill, and blame him!

84
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,720
So we have the Kambura connection.

85
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,480
What do you think?

86
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,680
Tayyar Kaymak,
who died in the house that night,

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
has a brother, Hamza Kaymak.

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,320
We think he might know something.

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Maybe he's the killer.
Maybe he wants to avenge his brother.

90
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,760
No, sir.

91
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,400
He was in prison for mugging someone
while the murders were being committed.

92
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,480
He's in prison, huh? Fine. Alright.

93
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,000
But he has to know something.
He's Tayyar's brother after all, right?

94
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,640
We need to find out what he knows.
Go to his prison and talk to him.

95
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,280
He escaped.

96
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,760
He fled the night when we were trying
to get Ufuk out of Kambura.

97
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
There's a manhunt for him right now.

98
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
No way...

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,760
See, Sefa? Another escape.

100
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
Come on, Chief.
It was a lapse of judgement.

101
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,040
He handed himself in.
How could I've known he'd try that?

102
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
Anyway. Fine.
Here's what we're going to do.

103
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,600
Nevra, you go after Tayyar's brother.

104
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Get print-outs of his mugshot.
Spread them around.

105
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
If he's out there,
someone will have seen him.

106
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,280
Sefa, you gather more information
on the house that burned down.

107
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,040
Anyone who remembers
or knows something about that night...

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Get the whole Kambura
in here for interrogation.

109
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
- Let's go.
- Right away, Chief.

110
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
This is not going to work out.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
What if I get really sick
before I do all these people in?

112
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,200
Then...

113
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,400
First...

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,840
Hello.

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,400
Do you have a last wish?

116
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,920
No?

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
You do?

118
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,800
Forgive me, but I don't give a toss.

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
Hello?

120
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes?

121
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Who?

122
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,720
Who, did you say?

123
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,280
- Hamza Kaymak, right?
- Yes, Ates, it's really urgent.

124
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't worry. His photos
will be everywhere in half an hour.

125
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,720
Thank you.

126
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
When will I see you?

127
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't know when
I'll be able to get out of here.

128
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,280
<i>Do you go home at all</i>?

129
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,560
- Sometimes, yes.
- Can I come?

130
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Come.

131
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Alright.

132
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
- Firuz...
- Yeah?

133
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,240
What do you have?

134
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Firuz, this won't get me
in trouble, right?

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Come on, Fiko!
You've known me for years.

136
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,480
Relax. You'll be fine.

137
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,960
What is this? What did you find?

138
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,400
I found some blood on the crime scene
that doesn't belong to the victims.

139
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,800
Probably belongs to the suspect.

140
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,720
- Is this the DNA report on it?
- Yes.

141
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,160
Good.

142
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,040
Here.

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
Don't spend it all in one place.

144
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,400
This isn't in the file
you provided the others, right?

145
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,640
- You threw it out, right?
- Yes. I did.

146
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,840
- I'll see you around.
- Firuz. How's your boy doing?

147
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,640
The same. No change.

148
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
What's this?

149
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,560
Deva, take a look at this. Come here.

150
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
Isn't that the corpse
that was found in the jungle?

151
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,280
Salim or something?

152
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,600
But what are they doing there?

153
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,080
Who are they?

154
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I don't know.
Respond to them and let's get acquainted.

155
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,040
One second. One second, miss.

156
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,760
Calm down for one second.

157
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,480
You saw the man from the photos, right?

158
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,880
Alright.

159
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
Where did you see him?

160
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,080
In a dream?

161
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,840
You saw him in a dream.

162
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,920
Sweet dreams, miss.

163
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,040
- This is impossible.
- Be patient. Something might turn up.

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you doing?

165
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,240
I'm making a list of the Kamburan gentry.

166
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
Tomorrow is the Kambura Day
at the station.

167
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,640
I might tell them I'm their new leader.

168
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,800
Hello? Connect them.

169
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,880
Nevra, I'm calling
your mom's husband in, as well.

170
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,040
I'm listening, sir.

171
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,160
Where did you see him?

172
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When?

173
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,960
Please stop wasting my time.

174
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,000
Ayhan?

175
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,680
- Ayhan, good luck with all this.
- Thanks, Agah.

176
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,440
We're doing our best to tidy up.

177
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,600
I'm sorry about last night.

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,960
You join us once in a blue moon,
I wish it hadn't been so unpleasant.

179
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,120
It wasn't unpleasant.
It was a proper disaster.

180
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,120
What was that?
I'm so glad we up and left.

181
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,840
I wouldn't want to get beat up.
I had a lady friend with me, too.

182
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
We were so scared.

183
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,120
What business do you have with such men?

184
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't worry, Agah.
There's nothing left to be scared of.

185
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,920
What do you mean?
What if they come back?

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,840
They were shot that night.
All three are dead.

187
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,520
No way!

188
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
Really. Not everyone's like us, after all.

189
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,840
They must've gone after the wrong types.

190
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,480
Tried to extort him, and got shot.

191
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,760
Istanbul has become unrecognizable.

192
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,640
It shouldn't be this easy to kill people.

193
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,880
Look how relaxed you are,
talking about it.

194
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,800
I don't recognize Istanbul anymore.
Especially not Beyoglu.

195
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,360
Oh, that old Beyoglu...
That dear old Beyoglu...

196
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,480
What can I say?
When you're right, you're right.

197
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,200
<i>Sadly, we've been getting report</i>s

198
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,480
<i>of mistreatment of residents
from nursing homes more and more lately</i>.

199
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,720
<i>However, we're at
a stellar nursing home right now</i>.

200
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,320
<i>We have a resident with us.
Let's ask her some questions</i>.

201
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,280
<i>Are you happy here?
Would you like to say anything</i>?

202
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,400
<i>I turned 65</i>.

203
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,440
<i>You look great.
I hope you see many more years yet</i>.

204
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,840
<i>On my last birthday, I made another wish</i>.

205
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,680
<i>- Like a child.
- That's great</i>.

206
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,840
<i>It was another impossible wish, of course</i>.

207
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>It might not be. I hope it comes true</i>.

208
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>You know what I wished for</i>?

209
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,040
<i>To become a good person</i>.

210
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,560
- Great. We should all aspire to that.
- She remembers everything.

211
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,440
What is it, Agah?
You're awfully interested in her.

212
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,360
No. I'm more interested in the TV.

213
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,200
Mine's getting old.
I might get one of these.

214
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,320
<i>Do you like it here?
How long have you been here</i>?

215
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,280
It's crystal clear.

216
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,480
Whenever I come here,

217
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
something's on the TV.

218
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:18,240
- Anyway... Good luck to you.
- Thanks. Take care of yourself.

219
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,000
Come on. Tidy it up.
We're about to open back up.

220
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,400
Come on. We need to tidy the place up.
Customers are on the way.

221
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,840
So with Alzheimer's,
let's say it's at an advanced stage.

222
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,280
It's all over.
The patient remembers nothing.

223
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,760
Completely disconnected from the world.

224
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,960
- Yes?
- Might they suddenly remember?

225
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
Might they get their memory back?

226
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,920
Is that possible? Is that a possibility?
Does that happen?

227
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,320
Why are you asking me this?
You're not at that stage yet.

228
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,120
It's too early to be
worrying about stuff like this.

229
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,840
I'm pondering every eventuality.

230
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,656
It's worth hoping for.
Is it possible at all?

231
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,880
I realize that
I'll forget everything some day.

232
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,200
But I'm asking you
if this is a possibility.

233
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,600
Agah!

234
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,480
Alzheimer's...

235
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,960
Is still shrouded in mystery.

236
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,200
Each person is an exception.

237
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Each case progresses differently.

238
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,080
But in general,
that's outside the realm of possibility.

239
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,760
Possibilities, exceptions.
You're not saying anything!

240
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm asking you if it's possible or not!

241
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,440
Remember when I told you
about sudden bursts of anger?

242
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,080
I don't want to talk about my bursts!
Answer me!

243
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,720
You're having
one of those bursts right now.

244
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,160
Because you don't answer!

245
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Because your question
doesn't have an answer!

246
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
Forgive me.

247
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I mean...

248
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,960
Even if there are no known cases...

249
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,160
It's possible.

250
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,680
How about you relax now?

251
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Take a few deep breaths
through the nose. Relax...

252
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
I can relax later! I can't relax now!
I have work to do!

253
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,760
- I'm leaving, with your permission.
- Agah...

254
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes?

255
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,680
- Are you up to something?
- I don't... What do you mean?

256
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Have you stopped taking your medication?

257
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,280
Of course not. I'm taking my meds.

258
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,120
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

259
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,840
Alright. For your next appointment,
please bring Zuhal along.

260
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
Excuse me? Why?

261
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,560
Is Zuhal the patient or am I?
Why does she need to be here?

262
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,440
Alright, fine.

263
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,040
Fine. I'll bring my daughter along.

264
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,280
How will I get in?

265
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,000
Where will I get in?

266
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
You poor Agah.

267
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,280
How will you...

268
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,760
Of course you can't.

269
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,600
Of course you can't.

270
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,560
Serves you right for coming so unprepared.

271
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,360
You're not about to sprout wings
and jump over the fence, are you?

272
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,160
Hello again.

273
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,920
You told me to come see you
if I needed anything.

274
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
No matter what, you said.

275
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
I need something.

276
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,720
Could you please die for me?

277
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,360
What are these?

278
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,880
The best picnics...

279
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,720
Are those had at home, Nevra.

280
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,520
I'll take that. Come in.

281
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
- Any news on Tayyar's brother?
- No.

282
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,320
There are, actually. Some woman called.

283
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,520
Told me she saw him in her dreams.

284
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,280
- How does that sound?
- Sounds great.

285
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
It's better than nothing.

286
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,960
When did you move in here?

287
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,720
As you can see, I never really did.

288
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,720
It's been like this for like six months.

289
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,080
I think it looks nice.

290
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,720
Maybe I should decorate
my place after yours.

291
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,560
I think that's a great idea.
Everything's all tidied up, you see?

292
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,360
Plus, when you want to move out,
you don't have to do any packing up.

293
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,400
Why? Are you planning to go somewhere?

294
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,080
I always go somewhere, Ates.

295
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,520
You can't tell from the outside,
but I very often leave my body.

296
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,360
- It's your turn.
- What turn?

297
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,680
I've told you everything about me.

298
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,560
Told you I've been rotting for years.

299
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,040
That all I want is
to become that old Ates again.

300
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,240
That Ates who
just got out of college.

301
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
That Ates who still believes
in journalism.

302
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,320
I've shown you all my scars.
Let you see all my pain.

303
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
It's your turn to tell me.

304
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,280
First, tell me why
you knocked on my door that night.

305
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,240
<i>You know how you say..</i>.

306
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,840
That all you want is
to become that old Ates again...

307
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm the exact opposite.

308
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,240
What I fear most
is becoming the old Nevra.

309
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,040
Why?

310
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,600
I think...

311
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,960
I don't know how to co-exist with people.

312
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,600
How to talk to people.

313
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,400
What to do with friends.

314
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,080
How to spend time with a boyfriend.

315
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,960
How to manage the space
between you and someone else.

316
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,680
I don't know how to do any of that.

317
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,480
But I've always pretended to know.

318
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,320
And I was always wrong.

319
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,000
I've had relationships
I really didn't want at all.

320
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,560
I've had friends that I never liked.

321
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,120
I couldn't say no to anyone.

322
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,760
I don't know why,

323
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,120
but I always cared so much
about what people thought about me.

324
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,360
As thought I had to make everyone happy.

325
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,360
Because...

326
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
You're...

327
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Good.

328
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
No.

329
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,800
Because I'm weak.

330
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,520
I'm so weak, in fact,

331
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,360
that I'm scared of opening those boxes
and running into the old Nevra in them.

332
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,520
I knocked on your door that night,

333
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,520
because I felt really lonely that night.

334
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,160
The old Nevra, the one
I never want to become again,

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
used to fling herself
into some guy's arms

336
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
whenever she felt lonely.

337
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
Ce... Ce...

338
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,000
Cemil!

339
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,360
Whom was I with on that night?

340
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,320
You, or...

341
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,840
The old Nevra?

342
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,280
The old Nevra...

343
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,360
The old Nevra

344
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,880
would probably be
with someone else right now.

345
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,600
That's what I ran away from, Ates.

346
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,240
Cemil, he has a gun, Cemil.

347
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,520
Cemil...

348
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,960
Cemil!

349
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,440
Cemil!

350
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,200
- You stay inside.
- OK, be careful.

351
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,960
<i>I ran away from myself</i>.

352
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,440
That's why I wanted a new life.

353
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,040
A life where no one knew me.

354
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,160
To be more accurate...

355
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,080
A life without people
who think they know me.

356
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,280
That's why I resigned and started over.

357
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Cemil!

358
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,520
Cemil...

359
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,640
There's no one here.

360
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
There was.

361
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,880
It was him.

362
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,400
- Who?
- The serial killer.

363
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,000
He's on everywhere.
He wears a cat costume.

364
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,600
He was there.
He had a gun in his hand.

365
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,800
- But there's no one around.
- He must've run away.

366
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,320
Maybe you scared him.

367
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,440
Funny.

368
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,280
Do you realize, Zuhal,
that you saved my life?

369
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,160
If I'd answered the door,
I doubt he'd have been scared of me.

370
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,480
- Let's go inside.
- Sure. Let's.

371
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
Cemil!

372
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,400
This is the first time
I'm telling someone all this.

373
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,280
Strange, right?

374
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,320
You chasing yourself,
and me running away from myself.

375
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
That's exactly why, I think...

376
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,960
We'll be a perfect couple.

377
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,880
- You know our first order of business?
- What?

378
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,640
You didn't eat anything.
Why aren't you eating?

379
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,920
Have you spoken to your mom?

380
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,920
She texted last night.
Staying over at a friend's or something.

381
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,120
- She should be back today.
- Who is this friend?

382
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,480
- I don't know.
- Aren't you curious?

383
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,280
She's an adult. Why would I be?

384
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,600
What do you mean, why? Is this a hotel?

385
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,920
Check in or out whenever you'd like.

386
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,480
You do it all the time.

387
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,880
We don't mind
you staying at your girlfriend's.

388
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,200
Stop running your mouth.

389
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,520
You're being ridiculous.

390
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,080
- Are you mad about something?
- Why would I be mad!

391
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,400
She should've let us know.
"I'll be here. I'll be back by this time."

392
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,920
Are you talking to me,
or are you staring at that screen?

393
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I can do both.

394
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,200
No you can't listen
and do that at the same time. Drop it.

395
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Fine. I've dropped it.

396
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,400
- What's that?
- What's what?

397
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,280
- That. Let me see that.
- Here...

398
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,040
- What's this?
- You're completely oblivious then, huh?

399
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,720
You don't watch the news?

400
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,240
He's a serial killer.
The first real Turkish serial killer.

401
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
How do you know it's a he?
It might be a woman.

402
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,200
That's possible, of course.

403
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,120
Why did you stick that on there?

404
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,640
Because he's doing incredible stuff.

405
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,640
What's incredible about killing people?

406
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,080
Depends on who you're killing.

407
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,640
Good morning.

408
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,920
Good morning.

409
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,640
They received another tip.
It seems legit this time.

410
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,680
There's nothing to eat around the house
except for our picnic's leftovers.

411
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,520
I'll be fine. Go save the world
so I can write about it later.

412
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm going.

413
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,080
Came all the way to my front door.

414
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,160
To the house.

415
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,640
To my house.

416
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,520
I knew this was going to happen.

417
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,360
I knew it.

418
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,280
If you're killing Kamburans, you're going
to end up at my door sooner or later.

419
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,080
What am I supposed to do now? Tell me.

420
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,520
Whom do I bury and where?
Give me something.

421
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,520
We have the DNA report.
I have a connection in the lab.

422
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,640
He gave me the file
without the others knowing.

423
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,800
Run it against the DNA
of 80 million people.

424
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,560
What's this guy's beef with Kambura?

425
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,040
What's your people doing there?

426
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
There's this burnt-down house in Kambura.

427
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,080
They're looking for the brother
of the man who died in the fire.

428
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,080
Yeah. Hamza.

429
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,840
- Mister Hamza Kaymak.
- Yes, that's his name.

430
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,760
- He's a fugitive. Escaped from prison.
- I know. Because I arranged it.

431
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,600
Hamza doesn't know about that part,
of course. He wouldn't even know me.

432
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,840
What is it, Firuz? Why are you surprised?

433
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,320
You thought I didn't have other friends
working in other places?

434
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,640
Is that what you thought?

435
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,960
Do you know where Hamza is now?

436
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,280
Gratitude is a dying concept these days.
I don't know where he is, sadly.

437
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,040
That ingrate called Hamza ran away
from the people who broke him out.

438
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,560
Why did you get him out of prison, then?

439
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,720
Because I knew you'd fail with Ufuk,

440
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,360
I decided to take matters
into my own hands.

441
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,360
Fine, but what does Ufuk
have to do with Hamza?

442
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,560
Firuz, the less you know,

443
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,880
the easier you'll sleep.

444
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,760
That way, you won't come to me
asking me to let you go.

445
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Got that?

446
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,120
We have lots of people
coming in from Kambura today.

447
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,360
Looking into the burnt-down house.

448
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,960
You know what
we were just talking about, Zuhal?

449
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,960
Why do you think he lowered his gun
when he saw you?

450
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,360
He didn't want to kill you.
He was here for me.

451
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,480
Why didn't he come inside?

452
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,960
I mean...

453
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,160
I don't know.

454
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,240
- Don't you find it strange?
- Very strange.

455
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,880
Maybe he changed his mind.
I don't know.

456
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,520
Isn't it possible that he regretted it?

457
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,280
It's not that easy, taking a life.

458
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,960
Well, Zuhal,
that depends on whom you're killing.

459
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
<i>Yes, Sungur</i>.

460
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,280
Why did that house burn down?
Who burned it down?

461
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,200
<i>I don't know who burned it down</i>,

462
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,120
<i>but we all thought Tayyar was a thief</i>.

463
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,560
I mean...

464
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,200
Word was going around.

465
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,280
Thieves drive me up the walls.

466
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,560
If he came to us, telling us needed help,
we would've given him everything.

467
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,560
But stealing? Come on.

468
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:20,080
We saw a crowd gathering around the house.

469
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,800
So I went over with the kids.

470
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,560
Suddenly, a fire started.

471
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,840
We wanted to put it out...

472
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
- But couldn't.
- You couldn't.

473
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,800
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

474
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm looking for Kamuran Gözcü.
They told me he worked here.

475
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,360
Brother Kamuran? Over there.

476
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,120
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

477
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,400
<i>Good day. Murder Bureau.
Nevra Yılmaz</i>.

478
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000
<i>I'm looking for Kamuran Gözcü</i>.

479
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,160
Come on in. I'm Kamuran.

480
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,200
Take a seat.

481
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,200
You said you knew Hamza Kaymak.

482
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,080
I know him, of course.

483
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,440
He sat right there just yesterday.
Helped us clean the mussels.

484
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,880
Then he got word of something
and started panicking.

485
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,200
He apparently talked to someone
last night. He was gone in the morning.

486
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,800
- Where might he have gone?
- I wouldn't know.

487
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,320
Bulgaria, Greece...
The guy he talked to smuggles people.

488
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
One of the boys overheard them.

489
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,760
And Hamza...

490
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,880
Probably to pay that smuggler,
he took all the money we kept here.

491
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,240
Look... I implore you.

492
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,960
If you find that man,
ask him about our money.

493
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,000
It was for their honest work.

494
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,200
<i>I don't remember anything, son.
I wouldn't know anything at all</i>.

495
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,600
Selim... Uncle Selim.

496
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,520
You must've overheard something.

497
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,760
You weren't there that night. I know.

498
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,920
But didn't people talk about it
around Kambura? They must have.

499
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,480
Well...

500
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,480
Our people don't like foreigners.

501
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,760
Not me, of course. But...

502
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,960
I don't discriminate at all.

503
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
But... I mean...

504
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,480
- That might be why.
- Because he was a foreigner.

505
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
Sure.

506
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,440
Foreigners are different to us.

507
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,120
<i>Different to us. Yes</i>.

508
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Ates...

509
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,320
You ran a story on human smugglers.

510
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,360
It had interviews and stuff in it.
I need to get a hold of one of them.

511
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,280
I don't care who.

512
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,480
Alright. I'll see you there.

513
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,320
<i>Nobody put chains on anything</i>.

514
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,120
Who told you they put chains
on the windows and doors?

515
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,960
It was all ablaze when we arrived.

516
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,600
Ufuk was crying out, trying to get inside.

517
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,120
We did our best, but it was impossible.

518
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,760
We were torn between holding Ufuk back
and trying to put out the fire.

519
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,040
That's when something fell on
Ufuk's head. A beam or something.

520
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,640
He was already a half-wit.

521
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,200
After that, he became really strange.

522
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,000
What were you doing there?

523
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,360
<i>Ufuk had been talking about it a while</i>.

524
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,800
<i>Saying he'd burn that place down,
saying he'd kill Tayyar</i>.

525
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,600
When we saw Ufuk
running to the house, we followed him.

526
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,200
To stop him from doing something stupid.
But we couldn't.

527
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,800
Why did Ufuk want to kill Tayyar?

528
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,920
Because he was a thief,
or because he was Romani? Why?

529
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,960
He's mad, I'm telling you.
You can't ask a madman why he did what.

530
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,160
Tayyar might've given him
dirty looks, for all I know.

531
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,400
It's a small place.

532
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,120
There's nothing to do but bicker.

533
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,680
You think being involved with
my daughter makes you immortal?

534
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,520
Alright.

535
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,120
If you're not going to bleed for now,

536
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,720
whom would you like to take your place?

537
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,240
How about your blood brother?

538
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,960
That works, right? That works beautifully.

539
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,480
I think that would be so poetic.

540
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Hello.

541
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,720
Who are you looking for.

542
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,400
- We're looking for Anchor Rüştü.
- I don't know him.

543
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,680
They told us everyone in Kumkapı
would know him.

544
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,200
Especially you.

545
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
There must've been a mistake.

546
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,640
I don't know anything.
I don't know any Rüştü.

547
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,440
We aren't after you.
Just tell me where Anchor Rüştü is.

548
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,160
- There's this street.
- Where is it?

549
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,040
You have a deal.

550
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,480
Anchor Rüştü?

551
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,440
Yes? What do you want?

552
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,600
I want this man.
His name is Hamza Kaymak.

553
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,000
What does it have to do with me?

554
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,800
He paid a smuggler
to take him across the border.

555
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,080
Why would I know about smugglers?

556
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,840
- Aren't you a smuggler?
- What are you talking about? No.

557
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm actually really calm by nature.

558
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,080
I don't like getting mad.

559
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,480
But I'm in a real hurry. Would you like to
see me get mad in a hurry?

560
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,240
What if you did?

561
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,760
What would I do...

562
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,880
I might start with
making you eat the shells, for a start.

563
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,040
Do you have
the license plate down? Alright.

564
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,400
Announce it over the radio.

565
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,240
The white minivan
will be leaving Tophane in two hours.

566
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,600
It's carrying illegal aliens
and the fugitive Hamza Kaymak.

567
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,920
I'm sending you all the info.
I'm on my way.

568
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,080
Nevra...

569
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,440
Did you just point a gun at a man
for throwing nuts on the ground?

570
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,640
I can do you one better.

571
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,920
I saw a bull in my dream the other day.

572
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,560
I pointed my gun at that poor creature.

573
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,640
Um...

574
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,560
I should head to the paper.

575
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'll clean up my office a bit.

576
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,680
Thank you.

577
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,840
I hope you find what you're looking for.

578
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,600
I already have.

579
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,000
- What happened next?
- Next, nothing...

580
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,320
He pointed his gun at me.

581
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,840
He took a good look at me,
and lowered his gun.

582
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,840
I shut the door, of course.

583
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,600
When we went looking for him,
he was gone.

584
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,120
- You didn't call the cops?
- Of course we did. Of course!

585
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,880
You must've been so scared.

586
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,920
It was really scary in the moment.

587
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,280
But thinking about it now...

588
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,960
There was this moment
when he took a good look at me...

589
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
It went on for a few seconds.
I felt something...

590
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,640
- I felt something really strange.
- What did you feel?

591
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,040
I mean... It was almost like...

592
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,160
Like I was sure he'd never hurt me.

593
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,600
It was so strange.

594
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,080
Yes. It really is.

595
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,800
I mean, my whole life,

596
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,880
I've never been so sure
that someone wasn't going to hurt me.

597
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,200
Do you get what I'm saying? Never!

598
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,800
No matter whom! Except for you, of course.

599
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,440
But look...
Look, this is burned onto my mind.

600
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm really little.
Eight years old. Maybe nine.

601
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,240
We're going on vacation.

602
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,400
My dad told me he'd teach me
how to jump from the pier.

603
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,520
I'm on the pier.

604
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,480
My dad's in the water.
He's gesturing me, telling me to jump.

605
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,640
"Come on, jump."
But I can't jump. I couldn't do it.

606
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,520
I felt my father
wouldn't be able to protect me.

607
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,680
Do you get what I'm saying?
It felt as though...

608
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,560
As though he could hurt me,
albeit unintentionally.

609
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,720
As though if I were to drown,
he wouldn't be able to rescue me.

610
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,760
If something were to happen
to me, he wouldn't...

611
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,560
I couldn't trust my father!

612
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,920
I couldn't trust my father on that day!

613
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,120
But whatever it was
that was inside that cat...

614
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,200
I trusted that thing, Deva!

615
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,200
Could he be someone you know, mom?

616
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,440
- Or might he know you?
- Don't be silly.

617
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,080
- I wish you did.
- Where's your grandfather?

618
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,240
- Huh?
- I asked you where your grandfather is.

619
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,040
He might be with his girlfriend.
I don't know.

620
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,680
Oh, Deva...

621
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,720
Hello!

622
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,560
- Is there anybody there?
- I'll be right there.

623
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,960
Hello. How can I help you?

624
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,400
I was looking for...

625
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,680
I don't know, a small houseplant.

626
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
Agah?

627
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,920
- Agah Beyoglu?
- Yes?

628
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,280
Forgive me, I'm not sure I remember you.

629
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,400
It's Tayfun, Cemil's friend!
From Kambura!

630
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Tay...

631
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,440
Tayfun! Is that you? No way!

632
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,000
- What a coincidence!
- You haven't changed one bit.

633
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,800
- You're still as handsome as ever.
- Stop it. I'm an old man now.

634
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,920
How are you doing?
What are you doing here?

635
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,280
Not much. I own this whole area.
I cultivate all kinds of plants.

636
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,680
How nice. How...

637
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,160
I was passing by and I needed
some plants for the house.

638
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,000
When I saw this place,
I decided to stop by.

639
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,400
- What a coincidence.
- Don't worry, I've got you.

640
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,000
You used to take such good care of us.

641
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,280
Do you remember all those meals
you bought for Cemil and I?

642
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,200
We were dirt-poor students back then.

643
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,520
Come on. Take a seat.
Make yourself at home.

644
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,000
You must be busy.
I wouldn't want to impose.

645
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,880
Don't be ridiculous.
I've sent the guys home.

646
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,320
It's almost closing time.
Come on. Let's catch up.

647
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,360
- Come on.
- OK, then.

648
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,720
What a coincidence.
It's a small world, I'm telling you.

649
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,600
We have the vehicle in our sights.
It's headed right to here.

650
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,240
Alright. Finish the paperwork first.

651
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,680
Don't let them suspect anything.
He might be armed.

652
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,840
Of course.

653
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,640
<i>Follow the vehicle,
but keep your distance</i>.

654
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,320
- Thank you. You're so kind.
- Of course.

655
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,560
So? Do you and Cemil
still see each other?

656
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,680
Cemil's too busy.
He's become an important man.

657
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,960
He stops by now and again.

658
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,320
- Would you mind if I had some raki?
- Of course.

659
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,600
- It goes down well at this time of day.
- Of course.

660
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,200
- Helps me clear my head.
- Enjoy yourself.

661
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,720
- You prefer coffee, right?
- Yes. Thank you.

662
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,000
You could join me, though.
Would you like a glass?

663
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,720
No. I shouldn't.

664
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,880
The other day, I was visiting a friend...

665
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,840
He set a beautiful table
and brought out a bottle of raki.

666
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,640
We were having so much fun, but after
a while, I started feeling really bad.

667
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,080
- Why? Was it your stomach?
- No. Memory loss.

668
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,520
I forgot what I came there to do.

669
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,440
I don't have the constitution anymore.
You enjoy yourself, I'm fine.

670
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,040
Thank you.

671
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,920
Pull over.

672
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,000
Good evening. Papers, please.

673
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,920
Good evening, officer.

674
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
Here.

675
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,200
All my papers are there.

676
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Everything should be in order.

677
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,400
- I have somewhere to be.
- Hold up. I haven't checked yet.

678
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,240
Get out! Out! Out!

679
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,840
Get out! Get out of the car!

680
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Get out! Out! Out, I said!

681
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,760
Get out!

682
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,520
Put your hands up!

683
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,400
Let me see your hands.
Get up! Get up!

684
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,080
Listen up.

685
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,440
They have Hamza.

686
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,880
- So? What am I supposed to say?
- What are you supposed to say?

687
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,520
Hamza will tell them everything he knows.

688
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,840
They've forced our hand.

689
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,920
You're going to tell them
everything you know, as well, Vural.

690
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,800
Keeping Ufuk in mind, of course.

691
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,800
<i>Is that clear</i>?

692
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,760
Of course.

693
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,240
- How many left?
- This is the last one.

694
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,920
- Name?
- Vural Yaslı.

695
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,640
Go on.

696
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,000
<i>Take a seat, Vural</i>.

697
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,360
<i>Vural Yaslı... Yes</i>.

698
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,160
Go on. Tell me what happened in Kambura.

699
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,880
How did you escape from prison?
Who helped you?

700
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,320
Storks.

701
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,960
Storks flew me away.

702
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,520
Then flew me back.

703
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,720
Who would help a poor man such as I?

704
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,880
I escaped on my own, of course.

705
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,320
Got myself hospitalized,
and escaped from there.

706
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,000
Your brother Tayyar and his family
died in a fire in Kambura.

707
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,200
What do you know about that?

708
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,480
I don't know much about it.

709
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,720
My brother liked to drink.

710
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,120
He was a drunk.
He drank like a sponge.

711
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,000
But you can't really help it.
You need workers to till the fields.

712
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,320
He came to Kambura every year.
Found a job to do one way or another.

713
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,440
They worked, him and his whole family.

714
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,440
A fire broke out at their house.

715
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,000
His family died in that fire,
including all his children.

716
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:41,320
That drove me up the walls.
I headed to Kambura.

717
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,840
I asked them what happened.

718
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,440
They told me there was a fire,
started from a cigarette butt.

719
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,920
I asked the fire brigade and the police.
They all told me the same story.

720
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,520
There was this guy, Halis. He used to
run the fire brigade. He's dead now.

721
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,920
He told us it was a cigarette butt
that started the fire.

722
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
That's what we all knew.

723
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,800
It didn't sit right with me...

724
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,680
It was a tiny house.
I didn't get why they couldn't escape.

725
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,600
Then two young men came to talk to me.
They were brothers. Twins, apparently.

726
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,440
- One was named Seyfi or something.
- And the other's name, Umut?

727
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,240
That might've been it. It's been a while.

728
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,160
- They're Ufuk's brothers.
- Ufuk?

729
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,560
They're actually triplets.
Go on with your story.

730
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,320
<i>They told me
to drop the subject and go home</i>.

731
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,320
<i>I asked them why.
They told me my brother, Tayyar</i>,

732
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,840
<i>had raped a young girl from Kambura.
And not once, at that. Again and again</i>.

733
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,160
<i>His time must've come, they said</i>.

734
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,360
If you keep hanging around,
they might decide

735
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,920
to take her revenge on you, they said.

736
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,720
They weren't talking about someone else.

737
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,160
They were threatening me.

738
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,880
<i>"Since you're Tayyar's brother,
you might die before your time.</i>"

739
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
"They'll plug you full of holes."
That's exactly what they said.

740
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,080
Nevra came to Kambura.
We spoke in front of the house, in fact.

741
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,040
That's where we ran into
each other after all those years.

742
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,760
It can't have been more than a week.

743
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,360
Ufuk found out about it.

744
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Came to me, told me a cop from Istanbul
was there to take him away.

745
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,000
I asked him what he'd done.

746
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,040
Asked him why...

747
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,720
"I burned that house down," he said.
"I killed those people."

748
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,520
But he'd been singing
the same refrain for years,

749
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,040
so I didn't take him very seriously.

750
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,960
He told me about a girl then.

751
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,520
There was apparently someone
Ufuk had been pining after.

752
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,200
That bastard named Tayyar raped her.

753
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,760
Ufuk decided to kill him in a fire.

754
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,120
That was the night.

755
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,400
He went to the house
and put chains around the exits.

756
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,560
Then he started the fire.

757
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,440
I was stunned, of course.

758
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,920
Who is this girl?

759
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,280
Whom did Tayyar rape?

760
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,040
<i>Why didn't we ever find out about it</i>?

761
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,720
<i>He didn't answer any of it.
Just up and left</i>.

762
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,240
I thought he was hallucinating again.
He'd never been all there, you know.

763
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,960
But it all turned out to be true.
He really did burn that house down.

764
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,040
<i>Why else would he hang himself</i>?

765
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,440
Tayyar's family had been inside.
His children, his wife.

766
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,560
All dead.

767
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,520
Who could live with that knowledge?

768
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,400
We saw the flames and ran over.

769
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,400
We gathered around the house...

770
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,080
But there was nothing we could do.

771
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,320
Remember that fireman
who told us it was a cigarette butt?

772
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,080
The late Halis?

773
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,000
He had been protecting Ufuk.

774
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,240
He must've known what really happened.

775
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,360
His brothers must've known also.

776
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,360
Seyfi and Umut were their names.
May God forgive their sins.

777
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,160
Do you think your brother
might've really done it?

778
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:16,600
- Could he really have raped that girl?
- I don't know.

779
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,600
He would never do something like that
when sober. That, I'm certain of.

780
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,440
But drink? Drink turns people inside out.

781
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,920
You never know who people really are.
Not even your own brother.

782
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,520
That's why I left Kambura.

783
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,920
Did they tell you who the girl was?

784
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,400
- No, they didn't.
- Are you sure?

785
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,000
I don't know!

786
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
No. I don't know who she was.

787
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,800
<i>She must've been really scared</i>.

788
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,480
<i>She didn't make herself known</i>.

789
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,320
Let me tell you something.
If we'd known about what he did,

790
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,400
we would've been the ones
to burn that house down.

791
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,560
We would've fucked his whole family.

792
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,520
I mean, when I say fuck...
As a figure of speech, you understand.

793
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,120
We would never touch
his wife and his kids.

794
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,240
- There's a proper way of doing things.
- A proper way...

795
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,520
You'd fuck him properly.

796
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,560
Back then, of course,
villages didn't look like they do today.

797
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
They were properly rural.

798
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,440
I was in some county in Anatolia,

799
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,440
working as a court clerk.

800
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,160
<i>I come across this murder file</i>.

801
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,640
<i>I open it up
and look at the suspect's statement</i>.

802
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,680
<i>He's a young man. 18 or so</i>.

803
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,040
<i>His father takes him aside</i>,

804
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:42,440
<i>tells him
about the blood feud his family's in</i>.

805
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,120
<i>They looked into it after the fact.
It had been going for 60-70 years</i>.

806
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,640
<i>Two families,
killing each other one by one</i>.

807
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,760
<i>Anyway, the father says to his son,
"It's our turn to take a life.</i>"

808
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,320
<i>"You're going to do it. You're young,
you won't do much time.</i>"

809
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,840
<i>The boy's father brings out the gun.
It's a family heirloom</i>.

810
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,360
<i>They've been using that same gun
to kill their enemies for 70 years</i>.

811
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,560
<i>Right there,
the father teaches him how to use it</i>.

812
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,480
<i>"Here's how you load the chamber.
Here's how you cock the gun.</i>"

813
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,040
<i>"You got it?" his father asks the boy.
"I got it," the boy says</i>.

814
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,240
<i>He takes the gun in his hand,
and shoots his father. Just like that</i>.

815
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,760
<i>Doesn't even hesitate</i>.

816
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,320
<i>The gendarme asks him,
"Why did you do it?</i>"

817
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,040
<i>"Why else?" says the boy.
"I wanted to end the feud.</i>"

818
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,280
<i>They ask the boy again in court</i>.

819
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:39,360
<i>"We get it, you wanted the feud to end.
But how could you shoot your father?</i>"

820
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,960
<i>"Well," the boy says,
"I've always hated my father.</i>"

821
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,960
"I would've killed him a long time ago,
but I didn't have a gun."

822
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,920
- That's some story.
- It is.

823
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,480
What about the blood feud?
Did it end?

824
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,040
It did. The other family was baffled.

825
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,360
The feud ended,
but it was the boy that suffered for it.

826
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,520
He was sentenced to life.
Isn't that how it always goes?

827
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,840
The young are always the ones
who end up suffering.

828
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,680
- It's all over the TV.
- Why do you say that?

829
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,160
Why hasn't there ever been
an elderly suicide bomber, for example?

830
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,400
It's always the young
who blow themselves up.

831
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,480
It's always the young ones.
Never the elderly.

832
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,800
The young ones die so quick,
so easily... It's a real pity.

833
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,440
Their lives have no value.

834
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:32,800
How can there be a meaning to life
if there is no value to it, right?

835
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,360
How have we gotten onto this subject?

836
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,320
I don't know. I must be getting drunk.

837
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,400
Anyway. I've kept you too long.
Give me some flowers and I'll go.

838
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,480
Of course.

839
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,760
I want something for the windowsill.

840
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,800
- What would work?
- Here. This one. Here.

841
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,320
- I'll give you this one.
- A rubber plant?

842
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,360
- Yeah. You need to water it twice a week.
- Alright.

843
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,400
- It likes sunlight, but not too much.
- Of course. Of course.

844
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,480
Mebrure used to love these.
What do I owe you?

845
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,656
- Don't even mention it.
- No way. I want to pay for it.

846
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,480
- I can't take your money.
- Of course you can.

847
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,400
I know we're friends,
but this is business.

848
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,960
- But...
- It's your first sale to me.

849
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,760
I hope it brings you luck.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

850
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:25,080
- You're too kind.
- Don't be silly.

851
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,880
- Thank you so much. Say hi to Cemil.
- Of course. Take care.

852
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
- Take care.
- Come back soon.

853
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,440
Goodbye. Of course.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

854
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,240
Oh...

855
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:03,760
The bag...

856
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Of course...

857
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,040
Oh...

858
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,160
That was some explosion.

859
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,520
I must've went overboard with the bomb.

860
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:45,800
I almost went back for the bag.
I'm starting to really lose it.

861
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,120
SAVE ME NEVRA
