00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
LAWS OF REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

2
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
Poor Agah.

3
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
Munir?

4
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Munir?

5
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Where are you, my boy?

6
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,120
Munir?

7
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Munir?

8
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Munir?

9
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,000
Come on boy, it's time for breakfast.
Where are you?

10
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
Munir!

11
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
Where are you, sir?

12
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Munir?

13
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,080
Have you gone to
a vacation or something?

14
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
No.

15
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,120
- So Munir has never been alone?
- No.

16
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
You haven't delayed his treatment?

17
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,160
No, I was giving him the cat food
you gave me for his...

18
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,440
- Acute kidney failure.
- Yes.

19
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Did he die because of that?

20
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,880
Because of acute kidney failure.

21
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Not just that.
The cat has also been dehydrated.

22
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
How?

23
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
MUNIR - MY LOVELY CAT

24
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
Man, what are we going to do with her?

25
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,560
She's been here for six months
and they are still talking about Nevra.

26
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
You are bothered because
you couldn't sleep with her.

27
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
Fuck off. What the fuck
are you talking about?

28
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,320
How many of my classmates is crazy
about coming here, do you know?

29
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
<i>She literally came
here out of nowhere</i>.

30
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,600
<i>Do you know why?
Because she is a woman</i>.

31
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
<i>They called it positive discrimination</i>.

32
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,120
<i>What part of this is positive?
There are many strong men out there</i>.

33
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
<i>But for them it's necessary to put
Nevra into the spotlight</i>.

34
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
<i>Nevra, Nevra</i>.

35
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,200
<i>Fuck that thing
called 'human resources'</i>.

36
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,720
<i>What does it have to do with that?
Let's say you're out there with Nevra</i>.

37
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,480
<i>Would you trust Nevra?
Could you trust her</i>?

38
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
<i>I would trust more
if it was a man holding the gun</i>.

39
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,440
<i>- At least it would be clear what he'd do.
- See</i>.

40
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
<i>She can get the fuck out of here</i>.

41
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>But she shouldn't go without a fuck</i>.

42
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,120
Definitely.

43
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Nurten, could you schedule
an appointment for next week, please?

44
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Agah Beyoglu.

45
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Thanks.

46
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Now...

47
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,520
First thing we should do
is to inform your family.

48
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
They have to know about this first.

49
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
Your wife had passed away.

50
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes.

51
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
It's been 10 years.

52
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
You have a daughter.

53
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes, but she's not here,
she's living abroad.

54
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,480
Doesn't matter, you should inform her.

55
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,840
She may even call me,
I would like to talk to her.

56
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Are we clear?

57
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes.

58
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Bon appetit.

59
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
I was thinking if we should redo the test,
in case the results are wrong.

60
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
I knew a guy named Necmi.

61
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
- They said he had cancer but then...
- I know.

62
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I know.

63
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
It's hard to accept.

64
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
But the results are clear.

65
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
So are the symptoms.

66
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
For me, there is no doubt
in this diagnosis, Agah.

67
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,240
You have early stage Alzheimer's.

68
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
<i>Yes, Dad</i>?

69
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
<i>Honey</i>.

70
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
Dad, I can't do it.
I can't bear this anymore.

71
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
<i>What happened?
I'll call the Chief Inspector</i>.

72
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,680
Dad, I'm not a kid.
I don't want you to call anyone.

73
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
<i>Then why did you call me</i>?

74
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
Daughter?

75
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
<i>Dau..</i>.

76
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
But doctor, I remember everything.

77
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,080
People forget things
when they have Alzheimer's.

78
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,600
I worked at the courthouse for 27 years.

79
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
If I went there now
I'd remember where every file is.

80
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,360
You are in the early stages.

81
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,080
Ask me then, anything.
My anniversary, friends' phone numbers...

82
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
I know them by heart.

83
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,240
My friends used to call me
I was like a phone book.

84
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,480
Back then we couldn't save the
numbers so I memorized them.

85
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Agah.

86
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
You forgot to give water to your cat.

87
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
You forgot to feed him.

88
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
He starved to death.

89
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
How could I do that? How?

90
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Poor Munir.

91
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,000
Look, this is an early diagnosis.

92
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,120
This will be of tremendous help
for the treatment.

93
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,440
We have patients
that lived 20 years after the diagnosis.

94
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
So rest assured.

95
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Lived 20 years but
do they remember what they lived?

96
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,680
Alzheimer's directly affects memory.

97
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,520
It's one of the main reasons
for dementia.

98
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,240
But we will do all we can to stall this
and to keep your mind alive.

99
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
But sooner or later,
I will forget things, right?

100
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
Don't think about this now.

101
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
All my memories, experiences
will be erased, they will go away.

102
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
What will happen to me?

103
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I mean...

104
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Phone numbers aren't that important.

105
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
But what will happen to my personality?

106
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Wouldn't it be erased too?

107
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
I will forget what kind of man I am.

108
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,640
You are alive but you don't exist.

109
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
How can someone endure this?

110
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
You may put this in your pocket.

111
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll check the sound,
say something, please.

112
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
- What should I say? Hi.
- You can count the days of the week.

113
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

114
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
Monday.

115
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
Tuesday, Wednesday.

116
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Thursday, Friday.

117
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
That should do.

118
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
Let's get started.

119
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
<i>I'll start with a basic question</i>.

120
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
How does it feel
to be the only woman

121
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
working in an homicide bureau
with 140 staff members?

122
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
How does it feel?

123
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,160
Of course it's amazing.

124
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I feel very privileged.

125
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,120
First of all, all of us here
are part of the homicide bureau.

126
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,840
It's impossible to see anything like
gender discrimination

127
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,560
or any other sexist approaches
in this institution.

128
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
Instead of any problems,
my friends are supporting me so much.

129
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
Which also means
another responsibility for me.

130
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,600
I am trying to do my best
to be worthy of their support.

131
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,200
- You studied public administration, right?
- Yes.

132
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,200
You even worked as a manager
in private sector

133
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
but then you decided to enroll
at the police academy.

134
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Yes.

135
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Why did you decide to
become a police officer?

136
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I always thought about it because...

137
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,920
The greatest man I know
was a policeman... My father.

138
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,640
Who is currently retired.

139
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,840
You start to understand things
as you grow.

140
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,520
We barely saw our father.

141
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,960
Maybe at the weekends, just for a day.

142
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
I used to resent him.

143
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,160
I used to tell him that
he cares about other people more.

144
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
It seems that my father's job
is to care about other people.

145
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,040
And he ingrained
this concept in me so much

146
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
that I don't know
how to live any other way.

147
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,680
I actually repeat this
in every interview

148
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
but being a police officer
is not a job for me, never has been.

149
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
There is a concept called goodness.

150
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,000
For me, being a police officer means
being a part of that goodness.

151
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
That's my purpose...

152
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
<i>To become a good person..</i>.

153
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Deva!

154
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Deva, answer me!
Where were you last night?

155
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Deva, answer me!

156
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,840
- Yes?
- Zuhal, hello my dear.

157
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560
Wait a minute.

158
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
Tell me where were you last night.

159
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,400
Look at me!

160
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,080
Where are you going?

161
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Come with me then.

162
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
<i>You're not going</i>!

163
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
<i>Deva, I'll fuck you up</i>!

164
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
Deva!

165
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
<i>Yes</i>?

166
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
My dear, is this a bad time? Did I
wake you up? What time is it there?

167
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,840
No, we are awake.
It's morning here. Is something wrong?

168
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
Do I need a reason to call my daughter?

169
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
I don't remember
the last time you called.

170
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm the one who always calls.

171
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,360
- How is Deva?
- Deva is making me crazy!

172
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,240
Deva doesn't listen to me,
we can't even talk...

173
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,800
Dad, did you take
the vitamins I sent you?

174
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
I did, thank you.

175
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>But don't take them in high doses,
they may cause diabetes</i>.

176
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
<i>You take one</i>.

177
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
And keep taking for three months...

178
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,760
Take them for three months
then stop taking for a month.

179
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Then you take them for another
three months. Don't ignore it.

180
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
You didn't listen either.

181
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
What?

182
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,240
You didn't listen to us
when you were young either.

183
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Is that so?

184
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
How would you know?

185
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,280
How would you know?
Deva is 16 years old.

186
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,040
When I was 16,
it was my fifth year on boarding school.

187
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
Remember that you sent me away?

188
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
<i>Were you with me</i>?

189
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
<i>Was my mother there</i>?

190
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,840
How would you know
if I had listened someone or not?

191
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
Did you know what I was doing?

192
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
Do you know
what I'm doing right now? No!

193
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,800
What can I do, my dear. You ran away to
the other side of the world, to Australia.

194
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
Dad, I'm getting a divorce.

195
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
<i>Do you have any idea about this</i>?

196
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,880
<i>Dad, I'm sorry</i>.

197
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,440
I didn't mean to. I am very upset.

198
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

199
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,800
<i>Were you going to say something?
Were you..</i>.

200
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,200
I propose a toast for Nevra.

201
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
Different interviews, every week.

202
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
Finally, one of us is famous.

203
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,960
- Don't be silly, I'm not famous.
- Oh, wait, what was it?

204
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
To Nevra...

205
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
Who reassures friends
and awes foes.

206
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
To Nevra the po-po!

207
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,280
- What do you mean by po-po?
- She said po-po.

208
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
They say that in the movies all the time.
I've always wanted to say po-po.

209
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,040
Nice, are you finished? May I drink now?

210
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
All jokes aside, Nevra,
why did you become a police officer?

211
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,600
What do you mean 'why'?

212
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
It's a simple question.

213
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
Why did you become a fascist?

214
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
What are you saying?
Are you a troll?

215
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
Are you drunk?

216
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
Hang on, I am curious.

217
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,680
We meet very rarely
and you say these things.

218
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
You are actually asking me this...

219
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Why didn't I get into
an insurance company?

220
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
Why I am not
in the ministry of finance?

221
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
Why I am not a banker?

222
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,680
Why I didn't act like a revolutionist
in college and then marry a rich guy

223
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
and sit on my ass
all day without working, like you?

224
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Here is my answer...

225
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
I didn't want to.

226
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I wanted to do...

227
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
I wanted to do something...

228
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
Something real.

229
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,320
What is that?

230
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
It's a simple question.

231
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,880
Why did you become a fascist?

232
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm just kidding.

233
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
She's offended.

234
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
She was like that in college too.

235
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
Come on.

236
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
To reuniting after all these years.

237
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
To this beautiful night.

238
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
Mumtaz!

239
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Agah, I'm here...

240
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,960
- Come, Agah. Come here.
- Excuse me.

241
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
That's why I don't come here.

242
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,240
The crowd, the drunks, the noise...

243
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
Bums in my apartment
are enough for me

244
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
and you brought me here.

245
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
You are used to this Agah.

246
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
I'm not. I couldn't get used to them.

247
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
How long have you lived here?

248
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,160
If you don't want to live here,
sell your apartments

249
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
and move away.

250
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
I won't go!

251
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
My last name is Beyoglu, they'll go.

252
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,320
- You will.
- I won't.

253
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
- You will brother!
- I won't go away.

254
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
I won't.

255
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,400
It's been so long since I saw you, Agah.

256
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,760
If I hadn't called you,
we were never going to meet.

257
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
What's wrong man?
Is there someone in your life?

258
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,240
Are you dating someone?
Are you ignoring us?

259
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm not ignoring,
I just don't have time.

260
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,880
Fuck off. In our age,
time is all we have.

261
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
You are a joke.

262
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't become introverted.

263
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,320
I can come and take you
to Bosphorus in mornings.

264
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Come here.

265
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
- Yes, sir.
- Taste this.

266
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
- Does it taste bad?
- Just taste it.

267
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,200
I can tell the cook to prepare
another for you.

268
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Why?

269
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,440
You didn't like it.

270
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,760
I didn't say that.
I said 'taste this'.

271
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Why are you bothering him?

272
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
He's offering a new one.

273
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,520
That's not the point.
People don't listen to each other.

274
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
Maybe it tastes good and I don't get it.

275
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Just go back to work. Come on.

276
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
- Go.
- No!

277
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
You surprised me.

278
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,480
Our peaceful, sweet Agah

279
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
scolding the waiter. I can't believe it.

280
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
That's not the point.

281
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
People don't listen
to each other properly.

282
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,520
Automatic answers without waiting.

283
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
Everything is automated now,
and they say we can't get along.

284
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,520
Don't get mad, okay.

285
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Let's eat and go,
we'll go somewhere else.

286
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,840
I shouldn't come, it's late.

287
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
That's the automatic answer.
It's not late, it's 8:30 pm.

288
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
Muazzez also asked to see you.

289
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,960
She told me to bring you with me.

290
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,920
Our friends organized an event
that we should...

291
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,560
Where did that event come out from?

292
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
For god's sake! We're going.

293
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,840
That's it. My prostate destroyed me.

294
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,920
Destroyed me, made me miserable.

295
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,280
<i>What am I doing here</i>?

296
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,200
<i>Just hang on,
I'll introduce you to someone</i>.

297
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
<i>So is that why you brought me here</i>?

298
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>Did you set a trap for me</i>?

299
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,280
<i>That's Nukhet. And this is my friend
I told you about, Agah</i>.

300
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
<i>Nukhet</i>.

301
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
<i>Hi, nice to meet you</i>.

302
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
<i>Hello</i>.

303
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
<i>Nukhet has been taking tango lesson</i>s

304
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
<i>and I told her that
there is a tango master here</i>.

305
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,080
<i>Come on..</i>.

306
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
<i>You wouldn't mind
teaching Nukhet a thing or two, right</i>?

307
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,880
<i>It would be my pleasure</i>.

308
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,680
So... They're doing
a great job, aren't they?

309
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Yeah but, what's with us?

310
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,800
You are confused again,
why don't you drink something?

311
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to be like them.

312
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,800
<i>They will be drunk soon</i>.

313
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,080
<i>They will embarrass themselves</i>.

314
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,760
<i>And they will regret everything
when they wake up</i>.

315
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,040
Why would they regret?

316
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,520
They'll just get drunk.

317
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
They won't remember
anything in the morning.

318
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
How nice.

319
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
Since I won't remember,

320
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
I can do anything I want, is that so?

321
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
<i>Exactly</i>.

322
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
<i>How nice</i>.

323
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
<i>I won't remember, so I can do anything</i>.

324
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Won't they wake up in the morning?

325
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
You're obsessed with this again, Agah.

326
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,440
Mumtaz!

327
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
Eat one's heart out...

328
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
<i>Interesting sentence</i>.

329
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,840
<i>That's conscience</i>.

330
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
<i>It can eat your heart out, literally</i>.

331
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
Forgetting forever.

332
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Forgetting that you are forgetting.

333
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Yes, that's it.

334
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
I will forget everything.

335
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,680
I won't remember anything.

336
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
To Agah.

337
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm not forgetting.

338
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
One more please.

339
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Agah!

340
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Are you leaving?

341
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
I had an emergency.

342
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
You can call me whenever you want.

343
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
I am very glad to meet you.

344
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
So am I.

345
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,240
Have a good night.

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
There was no rape.

348
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I accept the murder
but there was no rape.

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,520
<i>For example, that woman</i>.

354
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
<i>Which woman</i>?

355
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,840
<i>That police woman</i>.

356
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,520
<i>- She was running after me...
- Is that so</i>?

357
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,720
<i>Told me to stop</i>.

358
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,920
<i>She pulled her gun and I stopped</i>.

359
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,360
<i>Then I turned and looked at her</i>.

360
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,360
<i>- Do you know what happened?
- What</i>?

361
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,160
<i>- She looked like she literally melted.
- Really</i>?

362
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,760
So, guys...

363
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,040
TOLGA YAZGAN CHIEF INSPECTOR

364
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,080
This incident stays in this room.

365
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,120
- Is that clear?
- It is clear, Chief.

366
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Firuz?

367
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
What?

368
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
Yeah, it is Chief.

369
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
Guys...

370
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,480
Do you think I don't know about
your messing with Nevra?

371
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,000
No one will mess with Nevra
from now on!

372
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
Is that clear?

373
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,360
And you will be working on
documentation in administration.

374
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,240
No more field duties.

375
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,760
Guys, we are done.
Why are you still here?

376
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,960
Go.

377
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800

00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,520

CRIMINAL RECORDS

380
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,360
Your daughter hasn't called yet.

381
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,960
She's very busy, but I told her.

382
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
What did she say?

383
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
- She'll come here soon.
- Nice.

384
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,360
Are you taking your medicines?

385
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,040
- Yes.
- Nice.

386
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

387
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,400
Recently...

388
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,600
Last week...

389
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,560
Have you gotten angry for no reason?

390
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,240
Something like a tantrum.

391
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,480
- Not really.
- Nice.

392
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,640
I'm asking this because
this tantrum may occur any time.

393
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,560
You may feel insecure.

394
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,920
You may be sensitive about something

395
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,200
that you haven't cared about before.

396
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,520
These things may happen.

397
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,960
If something like this happens,
take a note.

398
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,200
Have you started
doing your homework?

399
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,520
Have you started taking notes?

400
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,760
MY NAMES IS AGAH BEYOGLU.
I THREW MY TV INTO THE STREET.

401
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,720
- I'm taking notes, yes.
- Very good.

402
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,600
Okay, what about physical activities?

403
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,640
You were going to walk.

404
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,880
You should make an effort,
I said simple sports may also do.

405
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
Yes, I am doing those things.

406
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,080
- I'm very active nowadays.
- Very good.

407
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,080
Okay, let's talk about mental activities.

408
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,960
We should activate your brain neurons
that have never worked until now.

409
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,000
How will we do that?

410
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
For example...

411
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,880
One of my patients was familiar
with Latin languages.

412
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,160
And she started learning Japanese.

413
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,040
And she benefited a lot from it.

414
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,040
You want me to learn Japanese?

415
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,000
No.

416
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
Everyone has a different interest.

417
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,960
There must be something that
you always wanted to do but you couldn't.

418
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
There are many things I want to do.

419
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,520
That's it, very good.

420
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,400
Look, whatever it is,
however it is done...

421
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
You will start doing it
with utmost planning.

422
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,160
Look, planning is the key word here.

423
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
You should have daily,
weekly, monthly plans.

424
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,200
You should check if you are
following those plans accordingly.

425
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,320
You won't cut corners.

426
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,040
You'll make it complicated.

427
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
You'll detail it.

428
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,520
Let's assume that you'll water a plant.

429
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,320
You'll spray every leaf of that plant,

430
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,920
one by one, patiently.

431
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
You should enjoy what you're doing.

432
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,240
Agah, you'll do that
in such an impeccable way

433
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,400
that the plant won't be able to tell
if it's raining or you're watering it.

434
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,880
Are we clear?

435
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
- We are clear.
- Nice.

436
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,840
Very nice.

437
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,040
Okay, now tell me...

438
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,360
How have you been feeling lately?

439
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,440
I've never felt so good.

00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,240
Damn it.

443
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,680
- What?
- You are a mechanic, so you should know.

444
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
Why are mechanics always late?

445
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,160
What?

446
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,160
Our elevator mechanic for instance,
we waited for so long but he didn't come.

447
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Then he came, but he was late.

448
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,480
Who are you,
what are you saying?

449
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,600
Are we going to wait for mechanics
our whole lives?

450
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
- Go away, it's so late...
- No, I was going to say that...

451
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,240
You... Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you going in?

452
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,480
Just a sec...

453
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
You are going to write
these down on computer.

454
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,120
Good morning to you too.

455
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,120
TO THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AFFAIRS

456
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
<i>Come in</i>!

457
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
What's this?

458
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,880
My resignation, sir.

459
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,440
Really, I didn't get it...

460
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,400
I can see that. I am asking why.

461
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,640
I have to do that...

462
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,360
It's because of personal reasons.
You'll put it in process.

463
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,120
I haven't had my coffee yet.
I'm not awake yet.

464
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,680
Do you know what I'll do?

465
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,120
I'll take your resignation

466
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
and put it in my drawer.

467
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,960
And I'll give you five days off.

468
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,600
Go home, get some rest,
think this through,

469
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,520
and if you still want to resign
after five days, I'll accept it.

470
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,960
I'll put your paper in process. Okay?

471
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,680
- But, Chief...
- Nevra!

472
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,040
Did you know that it was me
who wanted you here at the bureau?

473
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,080
I chose you from 50 girls.

474
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,680
It wasn't because your father was a cop.

475
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,360
Do you know why?

476
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
Because among those 50,
it was only you determined to be

477
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,720
a cop although
you had a bright future in your job.

478
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
I told myself that she was crazy
and I needed someone crazy here.

479
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,840
Go home and think.

480
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Yes?

481
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,760
Turn it down!

482
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
She's driving me crazy.

483
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
She got crazy
now she's making me crazy.

484
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
How can I help you?

485
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,240
I'm Agah, Agah Beyoglu,
from the courthouse.

486
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,760
- From the secretary.
- Yes.

487
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
It has been years...

488
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,200
I was thinking
that you somehow look familiar.

489
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,040
I never forget a face that I saw.

490
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

491
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
- Come, come in.
- Thank you.

492
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
We were just having dinner.

493
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
- Are you hungry? I can prepare for...
- No, thank you.

494
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.

495
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,240
There was a girl cleaning the house
but she ran away because of her.

496
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
Everyone runs away.

497
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,040
Who would tolerate this?

498
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,480
Why don't you take your coat off?

499
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,120
No thanks, I caught a cold.

500
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
- Get well soon.
- Thanks.

501
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,120
It's been 20 years, right?

502
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,120
I guess so.

503
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
Do you remember Agah?

504
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,080
When I was working on archives.

505
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,440
Celal from assize court
recommended Agah, God bless him.

506
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,600
- He died too...
- Really, may he rest in peace.

507
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,800
He went there every weekend.

508
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,160
- Was it Kambura?
- Yes, it was Kambura.

509
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,920
Agah was working at the secretariat
at Kambura Courthouse.

510
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,040
You opened many files for me right?

511
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,440
We went there with you once.

512
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
We ate trout near the river,
remember?

513
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,400
- She's been like this for four years.
- What's wrong with her?

514
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,920
It's bad, Agah, bad.

515
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,600
She has Alzheimer's.

516
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,520
Get well soon.

517
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,920
She won't get well.

518
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,840
Look at her. She wasn't someone
to be like this.

519
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,000
She's ruined.

520
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
She ruined us too.

521
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,000
Our daughter is living in Madrid.

522
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,400
We went to visit her.

523
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,400
We watched a flamenco show there.

524
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,600
All these things are from there.

525
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,120
How do they say...

526
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,160
Feza's only connection to life is these.

527
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,800
I don't know why,
her memory only kept these.

528
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,320
Otherwise she neither
knows me nor our girl.

529
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Come on.

530
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,960
I take care of everything.

531
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,280
I even clean her bottom.

532
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
Like I can take care after myself.

533
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,840
So, Agah.

534
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
- Are you retired?
- Yes.

535
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,720
What was your wife's name?

536
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,880
Mebrure.

537
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,600
She passed away too.

538
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,600
May she rest in peace.

539
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,000
Thank you.

540
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,440
So Agah, why did you come here?

541
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,360
How did you find this place?

542
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,360
We thought weather is better on this side.

543
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,520
It's also far away from the crowds.

544
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,840
May I use the bathroom
if you don't mind?

545
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,080
I've come a long way.

546
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,400
Yes, sure.

547
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,320
I have the same problem.

548
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,280
My bladder and all are sagged...

549
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
Look, it's over there.

550
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,360
Come on, drink.

551
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
Drink it woman!

552
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,760
- Drink it, come on!
- Excuse me.

553
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
Do you have farsighted glasses?

554
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes, over there.

555
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,560
- It's on the shelf.
- Thanks, I forgot mine.

556
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,040
I'm running out of patience,
just take one sip!

557
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,240
Come on, at least take one sip.

558
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
So Agah,
what are you doing around here?

559
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,360
I had work to do.

560
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,240
If there is something we can do,
just say it. Don't be shy.

561
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,040
Yes, of course. I will.

562
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
I was nine years old.

563
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,960
The year was 1961.

564
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,040
My mom had baked a cake
for my birthday.

565
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,680
That was the first time.

566
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,200
I made a wish blowing out candles.

567
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,440
My wish was this...

568
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,800
Back then,

569
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,360
Yuri Gagarin was going to be
the first man going to space.

570
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,120
And I wished he would take me with him.

571
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
I believed so much
that my wish will come true,

572
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,560
I prepared a bag and started waiting.

573
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,800
I thought they will come from
The Soviet Embassy to get me.

574
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
But I was hearing that
they were communists.

575
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,480
People were saying
"Careful, they are communists."

576
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,600
I said then I'll be one too.

577
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
During that time

578
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,040
college students were staying
on the first floor.

579
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,720
My mom was calling them
communists too

580
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,720
and I knew they had
hidden books in our cellar.

581
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,720
I went there and stole one.

582
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,680
Poems of Nazim Hikmet.

583
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,800
I found the shortest one
and memorized it.

584
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,440
I thought if the Russians came,
I'd read this poem to them

585
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,920
and they'd think
I was one of them and take me.

586
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,760
Chief?

587
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,520
Anyways...

588
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,920
The date was April 12th.

589
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,640
The space shuttle
was going to be launched.

590
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Vostok-1.

591
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,360
But no one had come for me.

592
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,240
I thought they forgot about me.

593
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
<i>The shuttle was launched</i>.

594
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,720
Everyone was praying for
the shuttle to go through the atmosphere.

595
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,800
Only I was praying for it
to return half way around to take me.

596
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,840
And maybe the Americans

597
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,280
were praying for Vostok
to not go into the space.

598
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Whatever.

599
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
All day long,

600
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,240
near the radio,

601
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,120
I read that poem silently.

602
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,360
My head is a foamy cloud.

603
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,200
My inside and outside is a sea.

604
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,840
I'm a walnut tree in Gulhane Park.

605
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,440
An old walnut tree.
With long branches and pieces.

606
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,640
Neither you are aware of this
nor is the police.

607
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,760
I MET A GIRL YESTERDAY.
HER NAME WAS NEVRA ELMAS.

608
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,120
Whenever I read this poem
I feel like I go to space.

609
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,680
I am 65 years old now.

610
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,000
I made a wish again, just like a child.

611
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,240
An impossible wish, of course.

612
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,560
Do you know what I wished for?

613
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,600
To become a good person.

614
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,640
<i>Dad, I guess you are sleeping</i>.

615
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,360
<i>It's over, I can't tolerate this man no
more. We are moving back to Istanbul</i>.

616
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,680
<i>We are coming together with Deva</i>.

617
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,040
<i>I'll call you later</i>.

618
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,880
<i>Good night</i>.

619
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,240
FIRST FEMALE POLICE OFFICER
OF HOMICIDE BUREAU

620
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,200
HER ONLY GOAL IS TO BE A GOOD
POLICEMAN AND A GOOD PERSON
