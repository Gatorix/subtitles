1
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
LAWS OF REPUBLIC OF TURKEY

2
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
土耳其共和国法律

3
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
Poor Agah.

4
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,920
可怜的Agah

5
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
Munir?

6
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,920
Munir?

7
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Munir?

8
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Munir?

9
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
Where are you, my boy?

10
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,760
你在哪里？

11
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,120
Munir?

12
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,120
Munir?

13
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Munir?

14
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Munir?

15
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Munir?

16
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,760
Munir?

17
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
Come on boy, it's time for breakfast.

18
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,720
快出来，该吃早餐了

19
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Where are you?

20
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
你在哪里？

21
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
Munir!

22
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,760
Munir?

23
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
Where are you, sir?

24
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,240
你在哪？

25
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Munir?

26
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Munir?

27
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,080
Have you gone to a vacation or something?

28
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,080
你去度假了吗？

29
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
No.

30
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
没有

31
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
So Munir has never been alone?

32
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,420
Munir从来没有一个人在家待过吗？

33
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,150
No.

34
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,150
没有

35
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
You haven't delayed his treatment?

36
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
你从来没有延误它的治疗？

37
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,160
No, I was giving him the cat food that you gave me for his...

38
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,160
没有，我给它的食物是您给我用于治疗它的......

39
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,560
Acute kidney failure.

40
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,560
急性肾功能衰竭

41
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,050
Yes.

42
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,050
是

43
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Did he die because of that?

44
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,040
他是因此而死吗？

45
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,880
Because of acute kidney failure.

46
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,880
因为急性肾衰竭

47
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Not just that. The cat has also been dehydrated.

48
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
不仅如此，它也已经脱水了

49
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
How?

50
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
什么？

51
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
MUNIR - MY LOVELY CAT

52
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,040
MUNIR - 我可爱的猫

53
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
Man, what are we going to do with her?

54
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,600
兄弟，我们该拿她怎么办？

55
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,820
She's been here for six months.

56
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,820
她来这里已经六个月了

57
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,560
and they are still talking about Nevra.

58
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,560
但人们仍然在谈论Nevra

59
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
You are bothered because you couldn't sleep with her.

60
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
你是因为睡不到她才觉得难受吧

61
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
Fuck off. What the fuck are you talking about?

62
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
滚蛋，你他妈在说什么？

63
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,070
How many of my classmates is crazy about coming here

64
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,070
我有很多同学想来这里都想疯了

65
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,070
do you know?

66
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,070
你知道吗？

67
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
She literally came here out of nowhere.

68
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,360
她简直就是凭空出现的

69
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,600
Do you know why? Because she is a woman.

70
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,600
你知道为什么吗？因为她是女人

71
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
They called it positive discrimination.

72
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,760
他们称其为积极性区别对待

73
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,350
What part of this is positive?

74
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,350
哪里有积极的一面？

75
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,950
There are many strong men out there.

76
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,950
外面有好多猛男呢

77
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
But for them it's necessary to put Nevra into the spotlight.

78
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
但对他们来说，有必要将Nevra放在首位

79
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Nevra, Nevra.

80
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,240
Nevra, Nevra.

81
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,200
Fuck that thing called 'human resources'.

82
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,200
去他妈的“人力资源部”

83
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,050
What does it have to do with that?

84
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,050
这和这有什么关系？

85
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,050
 Let's say you're out there with Nevra.

86
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,050
假设您和Nevra在一起

87
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,480
Would you trust Nevra? Could you trust her?

88
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,480
你会信任Nevra吗？你会信任她吗？

89
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
I would trust more if it was a man holding the gun.

90
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,040
如果是个拿枪的男人，我会相信的

91
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,120
At least it would be clear what he'd do.

92
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,120
至少很清楚他会做什么

93
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,220
See

94
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,220
是啊

95
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
She can get the fuck out of here.

96
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,960
她应该滚出这个地方了

97
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
But she shouldn't go without a fuck.

98
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,600
但是绝不能让她轻易离开

99
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,120
Definitely.

100
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,120
必须的

101
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Nurten, could you schedule an appointment for next week, please?

102
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Nurten，你能安排下星期的预约吗？

103
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Agah Beyoglu.

104
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Agah Beyoglu.

105
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
Thanks.

106
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
谢谢

107
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Now...

108
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
好了

109
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,520
First thing we should do is to inform your family.

110
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,520
首先我们应该通知您的家人

111
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
They have to know about this first.

112
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,040
他们必须先知道这件事

113
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
Your wife had passed away.

114
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,120
你老婆去世了

115
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes.

116
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,080
是

117
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
It's been 10 years.

118
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,480
已经十年了

119
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
You have a daughter.

120
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,800
你有一个女儿

121
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes, but she's not here, she's living abroad.

122
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
是的，但是她不在这里，她住在国外

123
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,480
Doesn't matter, you should inform her.

124
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,480
没关系，你应该通知她

125
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,840
She may even call me, I would like to talk to her.

126
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,840
她甚至可以打电话给我，我想和她聊一下

127
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Are we clear?

128
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
清楚吗？

129
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Yes.

130
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
是

131
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
Bon appetit.

132
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,480
祝你好胃口

133
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
I was thinking if we should redo the test, in case the results are wrong.

134
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,440
我在想是否应该重做检测，以防结果不准确

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
I knew a guy named Necmi.

136
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,560
我认识一个叫Necmi的人

137
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
- They said he had cancer but then... - I know.

138
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,320
-他们说他得了癌症，但是后来......-我知道

139
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I know.

140
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
我知道

141
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
It's hard to accept.

142
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
很难接受

143
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
But the results are clear.

144
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,560
但是结果很清楚

145
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
So are the symptoms.

146
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
症状也是如此

147
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
For me, there is no doubt in this diagnosis, Agah.

148
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,720
诊断毫无疑问，Agah

149
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,240
You have early stage Alzheimer's.

150
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,240
你有早期的老年痴呆症

151
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
Yes, Dad?

152
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,120
爸爸

153
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
Honey.

154
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,880
宝贝

155
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
Dad, I can't do it. I can't bear this anymore.

156
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
爸爸，我做不下去，我再也受不了了。

157
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
What happened? I'll call the Chief Inspector

158
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,880
怎么了？我打电话给总检察长

159
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,680
Dad, I'm not a kid. I don't want you to call anyone.

160
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,680
爸爸，我不是孩子了，我不需要你打电话给任何人

161
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Then why did you call me?

162
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
那你为什么给我打电话

163
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
Daughter?

164
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,560
闺女？

165
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
Dau...

166
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,520
闺......

167
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
But doctor, I remember everything.

168
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
但是医生，我记得所有事情

169
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,080
People forget things when they have Alzheimer's.

170
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,080
人们患老年痴呆症时会忘记事情

171
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,600
I worked at the courthouse for 27 years.

172
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,600
我在法院工作了27年

173
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
If I went there now I'd remember where every file is.

174
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
如果我现在过去，我记得所有文件的位置

175
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,360
You are in the early stages.

176
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,360
你还处于初期

177
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,080
Ask me then, anything. My anniversary, friends' phone numbers...

178
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,080
随便问我生日，朋友的电话号码等等……

179
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
I know them by heart.

180
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
这些我都记得很熟

181
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,240
My friends used to call me I was like a phone book.

182
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,240
我的朋友曾经说我就像电话簿

183
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,480
Back then we couldn't save the numbers so I memorized them.

184
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,480
当年我们无法保存电话号码，所以我就记在脑子里

185
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Agah.

186
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Agah

187
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
You forgot to give water to your cat.

188
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,680
你忘记给猫喝水了

189
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
You forgot to feed him.

190
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
你忘了给它喂食

191
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
He starved to death.

192
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,160
它饿死了

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
How could I do that? How?

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
我怎么会这样？怎么回事？

195
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Poor Munir.

196
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
可怜的Munir

197
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,000
Look, this is an early diagnosis.

198
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,000
听好，这是早期诊断

199
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,120
This will be of tremendous help for the treatment.

200
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,120
对治疗有极大的帮助

201
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,440
We have patients that lived 20 years after the diagnosis.

202
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,440
我们有一些患者在确诊后已经生活了20年

203
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
So rest assured.

204
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
所以请放心

205
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Lived 20 years but do they remember what they lived?

206
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
活了20年，但他们还记得自己的生活吗？

207
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,680
Alzheimer's directly affects memory.

208
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,680
老年痴呆症直接影响记忆

209
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,520
It's one of the main reasons for dementia.

210
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,520
这是痴呆症的主要原因之一

211
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,240
But we will do all we can to stall this and to keep your mind alive.

212
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,240
但是，我们将竭尽所能保持您的头脑活跃

213
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
But sooner or later, I will forget things, right?

214
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
但是迟早我会忘记的，对吗？

215
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
Don't think about this now.

216
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,200
现在先不要考虑这些

217
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
All my memories, experiences will be erased, they will go away.

218
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,480
我所有的记忆，经历将被抹去，并且消失

219
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
What will happen to me?

220
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,240
然后我会怎样？

221
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
I mean...

222
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,600
我是说……

223
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Phone numbers aren't that important.

224
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
电话号码没有多重要

225
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
But what will happen to my personality?

226
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,880
但是我的人格将会怎样？

227
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
Wouldn't it be erased too?

228
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
也会被抹掉吗？

229
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
I will forget what kind of man I am.

230
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,320
我会忘记我是什么样的人

231
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,640
You are alive but you don't exist.

232
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,640
你还活着，但你并不存在

233
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
How can someone endure this?

234
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
怎么会有人忍受得了呢？

235
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
You may put this in your pocket.

236
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,440
您可以把它放在口袋里

237
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll check the sound, say something, please.

238
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,760
我来检查一下声音，请说点什么。

239
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
What should I say? Hi.

240
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,520
我应该说什么？

241
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
You can count the days of the week.

242
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,800
您可以数一数每周有多少天

243
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

244
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,240
星期五，星期六，星期天

245
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
Monday.

246
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,400
星期一

247
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
Tuesday, Wednesday.

248
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
星期二，星期三

249
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
Thursday, Friday.

250
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,280
星期四，星期五

251
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
That should do.

252
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
可以了

253
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
Let's get started.

254
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
让我们开始吧

255
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
I'll start with a basic question.

256
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,120
我从一个基本问题开始

257
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
How does it feel to be the only woman

258
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,600
作为唯一的女人感觉如何

259
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
working in an homicide bureau with 140 staff members?

260
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,320
在拥有140名员工的凶杀科工作？

261
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
How does it feel?

262
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
感觉怎么样？

263
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,160
Of course it's amazing.

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,160
当然很棒

265
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,280
I feel very privileged.

266
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,280
我感到非常荣幸

267
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,120
First of all, all of us here are part of the homicide bureau.

268
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,120
首先，我们所有人都是凶杀科的成员

269
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,840
It's impossible to see anything like gender discrimination

270
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,840
这里几乎没有任何性别歧视

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,560
or any other sexist approaches in this institution.

272
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,560
或的其他任何性别歧视的方式

273
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
Instead of any problems, my friends are supporting me so much.

274
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
没有任何问题，我的朋友们都很支持我

275
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
Which also means another responsibility for me.

276
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
对我来说也是一种责任

277
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,600
I am trying to do my best to be worthy of their support.

278
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,600
我正在尽我所能来得到他们的支持

279
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,580
You studied public administration, right?

280
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,580
您学习过公共管理，对吗？

281
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,280
Yes.

282
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,280
是

283
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,200
You even worked as a manager in private sector

284
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,200
您甚至在私营企业做过经理

285
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
but then you decided to enroll at the police academy.

286
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,560
但后来您决定报名参加警察学院

287
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
Yes.

288
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,520
是

289
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,880
Why did you decide to become a police officer?

290
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,880
您为什么决定当警察？

291
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I always thought about it because...

292
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
我一直都想做，因为……

293
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,920
The greatest man I know was a policeman... My father.

294
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,920
我的父亲是一名警察，他是我认识的最伟大的人

295
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,640
Who is currently retired.

296
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,640
现在退休了

297
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,840
You start to understand things as you grow.

298
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,840
随着成长，我开始理解一些事情

299
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,520
We barely saw our father.

300
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,520
我们几乎看不到我们父亲

301
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,960
Maybe at the weekends, just for a day.

302
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,960
也许周末可以，但只有一天

303
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
I used to resent him.

304
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,360
我曾经很讨厌他

305
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,160
I used to tell him that he cares about other people more.

306
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,160
我曾经说他更关心别人

307
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
It seems that my father's job is to care about other people.

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,400
看来我父亲的工作就是关心别人

309
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,040
And he ingrained this concept in me so much

310
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,040
他把这个概念深深地印在我的脑海里

311
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
that I don't know how to live any other way.

312
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
以至于我不知道如何以其他方式生活

313
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,680
I actually repeat this in every interview

314
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,680
我在每次访谈时都会重复这句话

315
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
but being a police officer is not a job for me, never has been.

316
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,720
但是当警察对我来说从来就不是一份工作

317
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
There is a concept called goodness.

318
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,320
有一个概念叫做善良

319
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,000
For me, being a police officer means being a part of that goodness.

320
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,000
对我来说，成为一名警察意味着成为善良的一部分

321
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
That's my purpose...

322
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,320
那就是我的目标

323
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
To become a good person...

324
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,760
成为一个好人

325
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Deva!

326
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Deva!

327
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Deva, answer me! Where were you last night?

328
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,240
Deva，回答我！昨晚你在哪里？

329
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Deva, answer me!

330
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Deva，回答我！

331
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
Yes?

332
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,800
喂？

333
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,470
Zuhal, hello my dear.

334
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,470
Zuhal，你好亲爱的

335
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560
Wait a minute.

336
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,560
等一下

337
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
Tell me where were you last night.

338
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
告诉我昨晚你在哪里

339
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,400
Look at me!

340
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,400
看着我！

341
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,080
Where are you going?

342
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,080
你要去哪里？

343
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
Come with me then.

344
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
那你跟我来啊

345
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
You're not going!

346
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
你不可以去！

347
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Deva, I'll fuck you up!

348
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Deva，我要揍死你!

349
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
Deva!

350
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,760
Deva!

351
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
Yes?

352
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
喂？

353
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
My dear, is this a bad time? Did I wake you up? What time is it there?

354
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
亲爱的，这个时间不方便吗？我吵醒你了吗？现在几点了？

355
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,840
No, we are awake. It's morning here. Is something wrong?

356
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,840
不，我们都醒着，这边是早上，出什么事情了？

357
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
Do I need a reason to call my daughter?

358
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,960
我给我的女儿打电话还需要理由吗？

359
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
I don't remember the last time you called.

360
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,320
我都不记得你上一次来电话了

361
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm the one who always calls.

362
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
一直都是我给你打电话

363
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
How is Deva?

364
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Deva怎么样？

365
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,470
Deva is making me crazy!

366
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,470
Deva快把我逼疯了

367
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,240
Deva doesn't listen to me, we can't even talk...

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,240
Deva不听我的话，我们甚至不能沟通……

369
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,800
Dad, did you take the vitamins I sent you?

370
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,800
爸爸，你吃了我寄给你的维生素吗？

371
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
I did, thank you.

372
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
吃了，谢谢

373
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,120
But don't take them in high doses, they may cause diabetes.

374
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,120
但是不可以吃太多，可能会导致糖尿病

375
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
You take one.

376
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
记一下

377
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
And keep taking for three months...

378
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,840
持续服用三个月

379
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,760
Take them for three months then stop taking for a month.

380
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,760
服用三个月，然后停用一个月

381
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Then you take them for another three months. Don't ignore it.

382
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
然后你再服用三个月，别忘了

383
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
You didn't listen either.

384
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,320
你也不听话

385
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
What?

386
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
什么？

387
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,240
You didn't listen to us when you were young either.

388
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,240
你小时候也不听我们的

389
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Is that so?

390
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
是吗？

391
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
How would you know?

392
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,400
你怎么知道的？

393
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,280
How would you know? Deva is 16 years old.

394
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,280
你怎么知道的？Deva今年16岁

395
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,040
When I was 16, it was my fifth year on boarding school.

396
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,040
我16岁那年是我在寄宿学校的第5年

397
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
Remember that you sent me away?

398
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,440
还记得你把我送走了吗？

399
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
Were you with me?

400
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
你和我在一起吗？

401
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
Was my mother there?

402
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
妈妈和我在一起吗？

403
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,840
How would you know if I had listened someone or not?

404
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,840
你怎么知道我听话不听话？

405
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
Did you know what I was doing?

406
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
你知道我在做什么吗？

407
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
Do you know what I'm doing right now? No!

408
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
你知道我现在在做什么吗？

409
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,800
What can I do, my dear. You ran away to the other side of the world, to Australia.

410
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,800
我能怎么办，亲爱的，你逃到了世界的另一端，去了澳大利亚

411
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
Dad, I'm getting a divorce.

412
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,000
爸，我要离婚了

413
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
Do you have any idea about this?

414
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
你有什么想说的吗？

415
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,880
Dad, I'm sorry.

416
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,880
爸，对不起

417
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,440
I didn't mean to. I am very upset.

418
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,440
我不是故意的，我很难过

419
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

420
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
对不起，请原谅我

421
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,800
Were you going to say something? Were you...

422
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,800
你刚才要说什么？刚才……

423
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,200
I propose a toast for Nevra.

424
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,200
我提议为Nevra干杯

425
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
Different interviews, every week.

426
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,080
每周都有不同的采访

427
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
Finally, one of us is famous.

428
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,720
我们之中总算出了个名人

429
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Don't be silly, I'm not famous.

430
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
别傻了，我可不是什么名人

431
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,850
Oh, wait, what was it?

432
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,850
等等，这是什么？

433
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
To Nevra...

434
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
敬Nevra……

435
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
Who reassures friends and awes foes.

436
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,800
让朋友安心，让敌人敬畏

437
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
To Nevra the po-po!

438
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,040
敬Nevra宝宝！

439
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,280
- What do you mean by po-po? - She said po-po.

440
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,280
-你说啥？-她说宝宝

441
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
They say that in the movies all the time. I've always wanted to say po-po.

442
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,880
总是在电影里看到，我一直想说

443
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,040
Nice, are you finished? May I drink now?

444
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,040
很好，你们说完了吗，我可以现在喝吗？

445
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
All jokes aside, Nevra, why did you become a police officer?

446
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
撇开玩笑不提，Nevra，你为什么去当警察？

447
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,600
What do you mean 'why'?

448
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,600
你是什​​么意思？

449
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
It's a simple question.

450
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,640
这是一个简单的问题

451
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
Why did you become a fascist?

452
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
你为什么成为法西斯主义者？

453
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
What are you saying? Are you a troll?

454
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
你在说什么？中二了吗？

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
Are you drunk?

456
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,880
你醉了吗？

457
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
Hang on, I am curious.

458
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,520
等一下，我很好奇

459
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,680
We meet very rarely and you say these things.

460
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,680
我们很少聚在一起，你别这样说话

461
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
You are actually asking me this...

462
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,920
你其实是在问我

463
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
Why didn't I get into an insurance company?

464
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,320
为什么我没有进入保险公司？

465
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
Why I am not in the ministry of finance?

466
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,040
为什么我没有去财政部？

467
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
Why I am not a banker?

468
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
为什么我没有做银行家？

469
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,680
Why I didn't act like a revolutionist in college and then marry a rich guy

470
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,680
为什么我不像大学里的革命主义者那样，然后嫁给有钱人

471
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
and sit on my ass all day without working, like you?

472
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,680
像你一样没事做混日子？

473
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Here is my answer...

474
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
这是我的答案

475
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
I didn't want to.

476
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
我不想这样

477
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I wanted to do...

478
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
我想做

479
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
I wanted to do something...

480
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
我想做点事

481
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
Something real.

482
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
真实的东西

483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,320
What is that?

484
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,320
做什么？

485
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
It's a simple question.

486
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,720
这是一个简单的问题

487
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,880
Why did you become a fascist?

488
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,880
你为什么成为法西斯主义者？

489
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm just kidding.

490
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,680
我只是在开玩笑

491
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
She's offended.

492
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,000
她生气了

493
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
She was like that in college too.

494
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,680
她上学时也是这样

495
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
Come on.

496
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
来吧

497
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
To reuniting after all these years.

498
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
敬这么多年后的重聚。

499
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
To this beautiful night.

500
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
敬这个美丽的夜晚

501
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
Mumtaz!

502
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
Mumtaz!

503
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Agah, I'm here...

504
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,800
Agah，我在这里

505
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,960
- Come, Agah. Come here. - Excuse me.

506
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,960
-这边，Agah-借过

507
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
That's why I don't come here.

508
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,120
那就是为什么我不来这里

509
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,240
The crowd, the drunks, the noise...

510
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,240
人群，醉汉，喧闹声……

511
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
Bums in my apartment are enough for me

512
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
我公寓里的流浪汉就够多了

513
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
and you brought me here.

514
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
你还带我来这里

515
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
You are used to this Agah.

516
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,280
你已经习惯了

517
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
I'm not. I couldn't get used to them.

518
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,480
没有，我还是不习惯

519
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
How long have you lived here?

520
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,760
您在这里住了多久了？

521
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,160
If you don't want to live here, sell your apartments

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,160
如果您不想住在这里，就卖掉您的公寓

523
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
and move away.

524
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
离开这里

525
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
I won't go!

526
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,320
我才不走！

527
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
My last name is Beyoglu, they'll go.

528
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,160
我是姓Beyoglu的，要走也是他们走

529
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,320
- You will. - I won't.

530
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,320
-你会的-我不

531
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
- You will brother! - I won't go away.

532
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
-你会走的！-我才不走

533
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
I won't.

534
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
绝不

535
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,400
It's been so long since I saw you, Agah.

536
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,400
很久没见到你了，阿加

537
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,760
If I hadn't called you, we were never going to meet.

538
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,760
如果我没有给你打电话，我们可能永远都不会见面

539
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
What's wrong man? Is there someone in your life?

540
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
怎么了，你的生活中是否有你爱的人？

541
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,240
Are you dating someone? Are you ignoring us?

542
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,240
你在和谁约会吗？还是在忽略我们？

543
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm not ignoring, I just don't have time.

544
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
我没有忽略，我只是没有时间

545
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,880
Fuck off. In our age, time is all we have.

546
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,880
滚蛋，我们都这把年纪了，有的是时间

547
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
You are a joke.

548
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,200
你真是可笑

549
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't become introverted.

550
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
别这么内向

551
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,320
I can come and take you to Bosphorus in mornings.

552
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,320
我早上可以带你去博斯普鲁斯海峡

553
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
Come here.

554
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
过来

555
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
- Yes, sir. - Taste this.

556
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
-是的，先生 -尝尝这个

557
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
- Does it taste bad? - Just taste it.

558
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,200
-味道不好吗 -尝一尝

559
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,200
I can tell the cook to prepare another for you.

560
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,200
我可以告诉厨师为您准备另一个

561
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Why?

562
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
为什么？

563
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,440
You didn't like it.

564
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,440
你不喜欢

565
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,760
I didn't say that. I said 'taste this'.

566
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,760
我没要你另外准备，我是说让你尝一尝

567
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
Why are you bothering him?

568
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
你为什么要打扰他？

569
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
He's offering a new one.

570
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,320
他另外准备新的给你

571
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,520
That's not the point. People don't listen to each other.

572
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,520
那不是重点，人们不互相倾听

573
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
Maybe it tastes good and I don't get it.

574
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
也许味道不错，我不明白

575
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Just go back to work. Come on.

576
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,480
回去上班吧，去吧

577
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
- Go. - No!

578
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
-走吧 -不用

579
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
You surprised me.

580
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,960
你真让我吃惊

581
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,480
Our peaceful, sweet Agah

582
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,480
我们平静，温柔的Agah

583
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
scolding the waiter. I can't believe it.

584
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,200
骂了服务员，我真不敢相信

585
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
That's not the point.

586
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,240
那不是重点

587
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
People don't listen to each other properly.

588
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,560
人们不能很好地互相倾听

589
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,520
Automatic answers without waiting.

590
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,520
自动应答，无需等待

591
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
Everything is automated now, and they say we can't get along.

592
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
现在一切都自动化了，他们竟然说我们无法相处

593
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,520
Don't get mad, okay.

594
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,520
别生气了

595
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
Let's eat and go, we'll go somewhere else.

596
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,160
我们吃完就走吧，我们去别的地方

597
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,840
I shouldn't come, it's late.

598
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,840
我不该来，太晚了

599
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
That's the automatic answer. It's not late, it's 8:30 pm.

600
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
那是自动答案，一点都不晚，现在是晚上8:30

601
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
Muazzez also asked to see you.

602
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,240
Muazzez还想见你呢

603
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,960
She told me to bring you with me.

604
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,960
她叫我带你过去

605
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,920
Our friends organized an event that we should...

606
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,920
我们的朋友组织了一个活动，我们应该

607
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,560
Where did that event come out from?

608
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,560
那件事是从哪里来的？

609
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
For god's sake! We're going.

610
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,320
看在上帝的份上！我们要去

611
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,840
That's it. My prostate destroyed me.

612
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,840
就是这样，我的前列腺毁了我

613
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,920
Destroyed me, made me miserable.

614
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,920
毁了我，使我痛苦

615
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,280
What am I doing here?

616
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,280
带我来这里干嘛？

617
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,200
Just hang on, I'll introduce you to someone.

618
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,200
等等，我给你介绍一个人

619
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
So is that why you brought me here?

620
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
这就是你把我带到这里的原因？

621
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
Did you set a trap for me?

622
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,880
这是个什么陷阱吗？

623
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,280
That's Nukhet. And this is my friend I told you about, Agah.

624
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,280
那是Nukhet，这是我曾跟你提过的朋友，Agah

625
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
Nukhet.

626
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,560
Nukhet

627
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
Hi, nice to meet you.

628
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,360
你好，很高兴见到你

629
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
Hello.

630
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
你好

631
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Nukhet has been taking tango lessons

632
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,400
Nukhet一直在上探戈课

633
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
and I told her that there is a tango master here.

634
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,920
我告诉她你是一位探戈大师

635
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,080
Come on...

636
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,080
得了吧

637
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
You wouldn't mind teaching Nukhet a thing or two, right?

638
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,240
您不会介意指点Nukhet跳舞吧？

639
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,880
It would be my pleasure.

640
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,880
这是我的荣幸

641
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,680
So... They're doing a great job, aren't they?

642
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,680
所以他们做得很好，不是吗？

643
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Yeah but, what's with us?

644
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
是的，但是跟我们有什么关系吗？

645
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,800
You are confused again, why don't you drink something?

646
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,800
你又一头雾水，为什么不去喝点什么呢？

647
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
No, I don't want to. I don't want to be like them.

648
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,280
不，我不想像他们一样

649
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,800
They will be drunk soon.

650
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,800
他们很快就会喝醉了

651
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,080
They will embarrass themselves.

652
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,080
他们会让自己难堪

653
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,760
And they will regret everything when they wake up.

654
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,760
当他们醒来时会后悔的

655
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,040
Why would they regret?

656
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,040
他们为什么会后悔？

657
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,520
They'll just get drunk.

658
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,520
他们喝醉了

659
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
They won't remember anything in the morning.

660
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,400
不会记住任何事情

661
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
How nice.

662
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
多好

663
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
Since I won't remember

664
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,400
既然我不记得了

665
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
I can do anything I want, is that so?

666
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,880
我可以做任何我想做的事，是吗？

667
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
Exactly.

668
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,360
正是

669
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
How nice.

670
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,080
多好

671
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
I won't remember, so I can do anything.

672
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,960
我不记得了，所以我可以做任何事情

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
Won't they wake up in the morning?

674
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,960
他们不会在早上醒来吗？

675
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
You're obsessed with this again, Agah.

676
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,320
你又在纠结这个了，Agah

677
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,440
Mumtaz!

678
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,440
Mumtaz

679
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
Eat one's heart out...

680
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,760
伤心欲绝

681
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
Interesting sentence.

682
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,280
有趣的句子

683
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,840
That's conscience.

684
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,840
那是良心

685
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
It can eat your heart out, literally.

686
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,440
从字面上看，它可以吞噬您的心

687
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
Forgetting forever.

688
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,120
永远忘记

689
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,560
Forgetting that you are forgetting.

690
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,560
忘记你正在忘记

691
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
Yes, that's it.

692
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,240
对，就是那样

693
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
I will forget everything.

694
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
我会忘记一切

695
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,680
I won't remember anything.

696
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,680
我什么都不记得了

697
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
To Agah.

698
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,680
致Agah

699
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm not forgetting.

700
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,920
我不会忘记

701
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
One more please.

702
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,800
再来一杯

703
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Agah!

704
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,400
Agah!

705
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
Are you leaving?

706
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,200
你要走了吗？

707
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
I had an emergency.

708
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
我有点急事

709
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
You can call me whenever you want.

710
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
你随时可以打电话给我

711
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
I am very glad to meet you.

712
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
很高兴认识你

713
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
So am I.

714
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
我也是

715
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,240
Have a good night.

716
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,240
祝你有一个美好的夜晚

没有强奸

721
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I accept the murder but there was no rape.

She is not the only fish in the sea.

她不是海中唯一的鱼

727
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,160
- All the girls love me. - Is that so?

-女孩们都喜欢我 -是吗？

729
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,440
- They melt with my one look. - Really?

730
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,440
-他们融化于我的一个眼神 -真的吗？

731

Which woman?

00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
哪个女人

735
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,840
That police woman.

737

-她在追我-是吗？

739
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,720
Told me to stop.

740
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,720
告诉我停下来

741
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,920
She pulled her gun and I stopped.

742
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,920
她拔枪我停了下来

743
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,360
Then I turned and looked at her.

744
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,360
然后我转身看着她

745
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,360
- Do you know what happened? - What?

746
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,360
-你知道发生了什么吗？-什么？

747
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,160
- She looked like she literally melted. - Really?

748
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,160
-她看起来好像真的融化了-真的吗？

749
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,760
So, guys...

750
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,760
伙计们

751
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,040
TOLGA YAZGAN CHIEF INSPECTOR

752
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,040
TOLGA YAZGAN首席检验员

753
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,080
This incident stays in this room.

754
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,080
这件事到此为止

755
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,120
- Is that clear? - It is clear, Chief.

756
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,120
-清楚吗？-清楚，长官

757
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Firuz?

758
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
Firuz?

759
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
What?

760
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
什么？

761
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
Yeah, it is Chief.

762
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,520
是的，长官

763
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
Guys...

764
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,640
伙计们

765
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,480
Do you think I don't know about your messing with Nevra?

766
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,480
你们以为我不知道你们招惹Nevra的事吗？

767
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,000
No one will mess with Nevra from now on!

768
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,000
从现在起，不准任何人惹Nevra

769
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
Is that clear?

770
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,000
明白了吗？

771
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,360
And you will be working on documentation in administration.

772
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,360
你将调到行政部门做文书工作

773
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,240
No more field duties.

774
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,240
不再执行外勤任务

775
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,760
Guys, we are done. Why are you still here?

776
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,760
还愣着干什么？

777
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,960
Go.

778
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,960
走

779
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
CERTIFICATE

780
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800

781
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,520

782
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,520
汤姆·琼斯（Tom Jones）的“不负责任”

00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,040
犯罪记录

785
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,360
Your daughter hasn't called yet.

786
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,360
你女儿还没打电话给我

787
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,960
She's very busy, but I told her.

788
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,960
她很忙，但我已经告诉她了

789
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
What did she say?

790
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,040
她说了什么？

791
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
- She'll come here soon. - Nice.

792
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,000
-她很快就会来的-不错

793
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,360
Are you taking your medicines?

794
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,360
吃药了吗？

795
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,040
- Yes. - Nice.

796
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,040
- 是好

797
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

798
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
好的

799
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,400
Recently...

800
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,400
最近

801
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,600
Last week...

802
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,600
上个星期

803
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,560
Have you gotten angry for no reason?

804
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,560
你无缘无故生气了吗？

805
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,240
Something like a tantrum.

806
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,240
发脾气之类的

807
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,480
- Not really. - Nice.

808
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,480
-没有-不错

809
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,640
I'm asking this because this tantrum may occur any time.

810
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,640
我问这个是因为您随时都可能发脾气

811
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,560
You may feel insecure.

812
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,560
您可能会感到不安全

813
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,750
You may be sensitive about something that you haven't cared about before.

814
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,750
您可能对以前没有在意过的事情很敏感

815
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,520
These things may happen.

816
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,520
这些事情都有可能发生

817
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,960
If something like this happens, take a note.

818
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,960
如果发生了类似的情况，记下来

819
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,200
Have you started doing your homework?

820
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,200
您开始做功课了吗？

821
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,520
Have you started taking notes?

822
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,520
您开始记笔记了吗？

823
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,760
MY NAMES IS AGAH BEYOGLU. I THREW MY TV INTO THE STREET.

824
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,760
我的名字叫AGAH BEYOGLUI，我把我的电视机扔到街上

825
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,720
- I'm taking notes, yes. - Very good.

826
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,720
-我有做笔记-非常好

827
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,600
Okay, what about physical activities?

828
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,600
好，体育锻炼呢？

829
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,640
You were going to walk.

830
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,640
你要多走路

831
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,880
You should make an effort, I said simple sports may also do.

832
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,880
你应该努力，做简单的运动也可以

833
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
Yes, I am doing those things.

834
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
是的，我在做这些事

835
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,080
- I'm very active nowadays. - Very good.

836
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,080
-我现在很活跃-非常好

837
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,080
Okay, let's talk about mental activities.

838
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,080
好吧，让我们谈谈心理活动

839
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,960
We should activate your brain neurons that have never worked until now.

840
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,960
我们应该激活那些从未起作用的大脑神经元

841
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,000
How will we do that?

842
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,000
要怎么做？

843
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
For example...

844
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,600
例如

845
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,880
One of my patients was familiar with Latin languages.

846
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,880
我的一位患者熟悉拉丁语言

847
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,160
And she started learning Japanese.

848
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,160
她开始学习日语

849
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,040
And she benefited a lot from it.

850
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,040
她从中受益匪浅

851
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,040
You want me to learn Japanese?

852
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,040
你要我学日语吗？

853
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,000
No.

854
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,000
没有

855
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
Everyone has a different interest.

856
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,160
每个人都有不同的兴趣

857
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,960
There must be something that you always wanted to do but you couldn't.

858
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,960
一定有您一直想做但做不到的事情

859
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
There are many things I want to do.

860
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
有很多我想做的事

861
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,520
That's it, very good.

862
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,520
就是这样，很好

863
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,400
Look, whatever it is, however it is done...

864
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,400
不管是什么事，要如何做

865
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
You will start doing it with utmost planning.

866
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,640
开始做计划吧

867
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,160
Look, planning is the key word here.

868
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,160
计划是这里的关键词

869
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
You should have daily, weekly, monthly plans.

870
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
您应该有每日，每周，每月的计划

871
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,200
You should check if you are following those plans accordingly.

872
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,200
并且应该检查是否按照计划执行

873
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,320
You won't cut corners.

874
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,320
不要走任何捷径

875
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,040
You'll make it complicated.

876
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,040
让这件事变得复杂

877
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
You'll detail it.

878
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,360
做好细节

879
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,520
Let's assume that you'll water a plant.

880
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,520
假设您要给植物浇水

881
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,320
You'll spray every leaf of that plant

882
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,320
要把植物的每一片叶子都喷水

883
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,920
one by one, patiently.

884
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,920
一片接一片，耐心地做

885
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
You should enjoy what you're doing.

886
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
你会很享受你正在做的事情

887
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,240
Agah, you'll do that in such an impeccable way

888
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,240
Agah，这样你会做到完美

889
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,400
that the plant won't be able to tell if it's raining or you're watering it.

890
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,400
这颗植物根本无法判断是在下雨还是在浇水

891
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,880
Are we clear?

892
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,880
明白吗？

893
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
- We are clear. - Nice.

894
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,520
-我很清楚 -很好

895
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,840
Very nice.

896
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,840
非常好

897
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,040
Okay, now tell me...

898
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,040
好，跟我说说

899
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,360
How have you been feeling lately?

900
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,360
您最近感觉如何？

901
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,440
I've never felt so good.

902
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,440
从来没有这么好过

903
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
SECURITY CLEARANCE

904
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,960
安全检查

905
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,560
IDENTIFICATION CARD COPY

906
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,560
身份证副本

907
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,240
Damn it.

908
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,240
谁啊？

909
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,680
- What? - You are a mechanic, so you should know.

910
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,680
-什么事？-你是机械师，所以你应该知道

911
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
Why are mechanics always late?

912
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,160
为什么机械师总是迟到？

913
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,160
What?

914
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,160
什么？

915
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,160
Our elevator mechanic for instance, we waited for so long but he didn't come.

916
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:43,160
例如我们的电梯技工，我们等了很久，但他没来

917
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Then he came, but he was late.

918
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,160
然后他来了，但是他来晚了

919
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,480
Who are you, what are you saying?

920
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,480
你是谁，你在说什么？

921
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,600
Are we going to wait for mechanics our whole lives?

922
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,600
我们要一辈子等机械师吗？

923
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
- Go away, it's so late... - No, I was going to say that...

924
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,840
-走开，这么晚了你到底要干嘛？-不，我要说的是

925
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,240
You... Hey, what are you doing? Why are you going in?

926
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,240
你……你进来干什么？

927
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,480
Just a sec...

928
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,480
很快就好

929
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
You are going to write these down on computer.

930
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,000
把这些录入系统

931
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,120
Good morning to you too.

932
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,120
你也早上好

933
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,120
TO THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR AFFAIRS

934
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,120
内政部

935
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
Come in!

936
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,400
进来吧！

937
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
What's this?

938
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,680
这是什么？

939
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,880
My resignation, sir.

940
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,880
长官，这是我的辞职报告

941
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,440
Really, I didn't get it...

942
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,440
我不明白

943
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,400
I can see that. I am asking why.

944
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,400
我知道是辞职信，我问你为什么

945
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,640
I have to do that...

946
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,640
我必须辞职

947
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,360
It's because of personal reasons. You'll put it in process.

948
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,360
因为个人原因，请您批准

949
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,120
I haven't had my coffee yet. I'm not awake yet.

950
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,120
我还没喝咖啡，还不清醒

951
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,680
Do you know what I'll do?

952
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,680
你知道我会做什么吗？

953
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,120
I'll take your resignation

954
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,120
我把你的辞职报告

955
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
and put it in my drawer.

956
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
放在我的抽屉里

957
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,960
And I'll give you five days off.

958
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,960
给你五天假期

959
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,600
Go home, get some rest, think this through

960
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:06,600
回家休息一下，想一想

961
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,520
and if you still want to resign after five days, I'll accept it.

962
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,520
如果五天后你仍然想辞职，我会接受的

963
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,960
I'll put your paper in process. Okay?

964
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:13,960
到时候我会批准，好吗？

965
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,680
- But, Chief... - Nevra!

966
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,680
-但是，长官 -Nevra！

967
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,040
Did you know that it was me who wanted you here at the bureau?

968
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,040
你知道是我想让你进警察局的吗

969
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,080
I chose you from 50 girls.

970
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,080
我从五十个女孩中选了你

971
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,680
It wasn't because your father was a cop.

972
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,680
不是因为你父亲是警察

973
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,360
Do you know why?

974
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,360
你知道为什么吗？

975
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
Because among those 50, it was only you determined to be

976
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,400
因为在那50个人中，虽然你的工作前景光明

977
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,720
a cop although you had a bright future in your job.

978
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,720
但只有你有决心做警察

979
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
I told myself that she was crazy and I needed someone crazy here.

980
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,120
我告诉自己她疯了，我恰好需要一个疯子在这里

981
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,840
Go home and think.

982
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,840
回家好好想一想

983
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
Yes?

984
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,880
你好？

985
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,760
Turn it down!

986
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,760
声音小一点！

987
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
She's driving me crazy.

988
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
她快把我逼疯了

989
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
She got crazy now she's making me crazy.

990
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
她疯了，现在要让我疯了

991
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
How can I help you?

992
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
有什么事吗？

993
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,240
I'm Agah, Agah Beyoglu, from the courthouse.

994
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,240
我是Agah，Agah Beyoglu，来自法院

995
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,760
- From the secretary. - Yes.

996
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,760
-您是秘书处的 -是的

997
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
It has been years...

998
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,240
已经好几年了……

999
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,200
I was thinking that you somehow look familiar.

1000
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,200
我就觉得你看着很眼熟

1001
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,040
I never forget a face that I saw.

1002
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,040
我永远不会忘记我看到的每一张脸

1003
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
- Welcome. - Thank you.

1004
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,920
-欢迎 -谢谢

1005
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
- Come, come in. - Thank you.

1006
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
-进来 -谢谢

1007
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
We were just having dinner.

1008
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,680
我们正在吃晚餐

1009
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
- Are you hungry? I can prepare for... - No, thank you.

1010
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,400
-饿了吗？我可以准备…… -不，谢谢

1011
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,680
I'm sorry, it's a bit messy.

1012
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,680
对不起，有点乱

1013
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,240
There was a girl cleaning the house but she ran away because of her.

1014
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,240
有一个女孩负责打扫房子，但是她把人家吓跑了

1015
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
Everyone runs away.

1016
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,480
每个人都被吓跑了

1017
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,040
Who would tolerate this?

1018
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,040
谁能忍受这个？

1019
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,480
Why don't you take your coat off?

1020
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,480
你为什么不脱掉外套呢？

1021
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,120
No thanks, I caught a cold.

1022
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,120
不用了，我感冒了

1023
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
- Get well soon. - Thanks.

1024
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,400
-祝你快点好起来-谢谢

1025
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,120
It's been 20 years, right?

1026
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,120
已经20年了，对吧？

1027
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,120
I guess so.

1028
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,120
大概吧

1029
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
Do you remember Agah?

1030
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,520
你还记得Agah吗？

1031
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,080
When I was working on archives.

1032
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,080
当我做档案工作的时候

1033
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,440
Celal from assize court recommended Agah, God bless him.

1034
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,440
巡回法庭的Celal推荐Agah，上帝保佑他

1035
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,600
- He died too... - Really, may he rest in peace.

1036
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,600
-他也死了 -愿他安息

1037
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,800
He went there every weekend.

1038
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,800
他每个周末去那里

1039
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,160
- Was it Kambura? - Yes, it was Kambura.

1040
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,160
-是Kambura吗？-是的，是Kambura

1041
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,920
Agah was working at the secretariat at Kambura Courthouse.

1042
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,920
Agah在Kambura法院秘书处工作

1043
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,040
You opened many files for me right?

1044
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,040
您帮我查了很多文件，对吗？

1045
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,440
We went there with you once.

1046
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,440
我们曾经一起去过那里

1047
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
We ate trout near the river, remember?

1048
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,160
我们在河边吃鳟鱼，记得吗？

1049
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,400
- She's been like this for four years. - What's wrong with her?

1050
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,400
-她已经这样四年了-她怎么了？

1051
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,920
It's bad, Agah, bad.

1052
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,920
不好，Agah，很不好

1053
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,600
She has Alzheimer's.

1054
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,600
她患有老年痴呆症

1055
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,520
Get well soon.

1056
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,520
祝她快点好起来……

1057
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,920
She won't get well.

1058
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,920
她会好起来了

1059
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,840
Look at her. She wasn't someone to be like this.

1060
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,840
她不是这样的人

1061
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,000
She's ruined.

1062
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,000
她毁了

1063
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
She ruined us too.

1064
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,840
她也毁了我们

1065
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,000
Our daughter is living in Madrid.

1066
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,000
我们的女儿住在马德里

1067
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,400
We went to visit her.

1068
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,400
我们去拜访她

1069
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,400
We watched a flamenco show there.

1070
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,400
我们在那里看了弗拉门戈表演

1071
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,600
All these things are from there.

1072
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,600
所有这些东西都来自那里

1073
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,120
How do they say...

1074
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,120
怎么说呢……

1075
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,160
Feza's only connection to life is these.

1076
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,160
Feza与生活的唯一联系就是这些

1077
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,800
I don't know why, her memory only kept these.

1078
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,800
我不知道为什么，她的记忆只保留了这些

1079
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,320
Otherwise she neither knows me nor our girl.

1080
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,320
否则她既不认识我也不认识我们的女儿

1081
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Come on.

1082
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
来吧

1083
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,960
I take care of everything.

1084
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,960
我要负责所有事情

1085
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,280
I even clean her bottom.

1086
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,280
我甚至要帮她擦屁股

1087
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
Like I can take care after myself.

1088
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,760
就像我可以照顾自己似的

1089
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,840
So, Agah.

1090
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,840
对了，Agah

1091
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
- Are you retired? - Yes.

1092
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,000
-你退休了吗？-是的

1093
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,720
What was your wife's name?

1094
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,720
你老婆叫什么名字？

1095
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,880
Mebrure.

1096
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,880
Mebrure.

1097
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,600
She passed away too.

1098
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,600
她也去世了

1099
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,600
May she rest in peace.

1100
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,600
愿她安息

1101
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,000
Thank you.

1102
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,000
谢谢

1103
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,440
So Agah, why did you come here?

1104
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,440
Agah，你来这里有什么事情吗？

1105
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,360
How did you find this place?

1106
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,360
怎么找到这个地方的？

1107
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,360
We thought weather is better on this side.

1108
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,360
我们认为这边的天气更好

1109
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,520
It's also far away from the crowds.

1110
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,520
离人群也很远

1111
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,840
May I use the bathroom if you don't mind?

1112
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,840
如果您不介意，我可以用一下洗手间吗？

1113
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,080
I've come a long way.

1114
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,080
我走了很长一段路

1115
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,400
Yes, sure.

1116
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,400
没问题

1117
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,320
I have the same problem.

1118
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,320
我也是这样

1119
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,280
My bladder and all are sagged...

1120
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,280
我的膀胱都凹陷了……

1121
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
Look, it's over there.

1122
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,400
在那边

1123
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,360
Come on, drink.

1124
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,360
喝一口吧

1125
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
Drink it woman!

1126
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,120
把它喝掉！

1127
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,760
- Drink it, come on! - Excuse me.

1128
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,760
-喝吧，来吧！-对不起

1129
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
Do you have farsighted glasses?

1130
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,120
你有远视眼镜吗？

1131
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,000
Yes, over there.

1132
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,000
有，在那边

1133
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,560
- It's on the shelf. - Thanks, I forgot mine.

1134
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,560
-在架子上-谢谢，我忘了我的

1135
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,040
I'm running out of patience, just take one sip!

1136
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,040
我已经忍无可忍了，只喝一口！

1137
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,240
Come on, at least take one sip.

1138
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,240
来吧，至少喝一小口

1139
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
So Agah, what are you doing around here?

1140
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,880
Agah，你在这附近做什么？

1141
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,360
I had work to do.

1142
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,360
我有工作要做

1143
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,240
If there is something we can do, just say it. Don't be shy.

1144
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,240
如果有什么我们能帮忙的尽管说

1145
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,040
Yes, of course. I will.

1146
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,040
是的，当然了

1147
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
I was nine years old.

1148
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
我九岁的时候

1149
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,960
The year was 1961.

1150
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,960
那年是1961年

1151
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,040
My mom had baked a cake for my birthday.

1152
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,040
我妈妈为我的生日烤了一块蛋糕

1153
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,680
That was the first time.

1154
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,680
那是第一次

1155
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,200
I made a wish blowing out candles.

1156
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,200
我许愿吹蜡烛

1157
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,440
My wish was this...

1158
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,440
我的愿望是这样的

1159
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,800
Back then

1160
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,800
那时候

1161
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,360
Yuri Gagarin was going to be the first man going to space.

1162
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,360
尤里·加加林（Yuri Gagarin）将成为第一个进入太空的人

1163
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,120
And I wished he would take me with him.

1164
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,120
我希望他能带我走

1165
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
I believed so much that my wish will come true

1166
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,640
我非常相信我的愿望会成真，

1167
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,560
I prepared a bag and started waiting.

1168
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,560
我准备了一个包，开始等待

1169
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,800
I thought they will come from The Soviet Embassy to get me.

1170
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,800
我以为他们会从苏联大使馆来接我

1171
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
But I was hearing that they were communists.

1172
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,920
但是我听说他们是共产党员

1173
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,480
People were saying "Careful, they are communists."

1174
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,480
人们都说“小心，他们是共产党员”

1175
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,600
I said then I'll be one too.

1176
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,600
我说那我也做共产党员

1177
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
During that time

1178
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
那时候

1179
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,040
college students were staying on the first floor.

1180
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,040
大学生住在一楼

1181
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,720
My mom was calling them communists too

1182
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,720
我妈妈也叫他们共产党员

1183
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,720
and I knew they had hidden books in our cellar.

1184
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,720
我知道他们在我家的地窖里藏了书

1185
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,720
I went there and stole one.

1186
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,720
我去那里偷了一本

1187
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,680
Poems of Nazim Hikmet.

1188
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,680
Nazim Hikmet的诗歌集

1189
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,800
I found the shortest one and memorized it.

1190
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,800
我记住了其中最短的一个

1191
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,440
I thought if the Russians came, I'd read this poem to them

1192
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,440
我以为如果俄国人来了，我给他们读这首诗

1193
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,920
and they'd think I was one of them and take me.

1194
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,920
他们就会认为我是他们的一员然后带我走

1195
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,760
Chief?

1196
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,760
长官？

1197
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,520
Anyways...

1198
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,520
总之……

1199
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,920
The date was April 12th.

1200
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,920
那天是4月12日

1201
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,640
The space shuttle was going to be launched.

1202
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,640
航天飞机就要发射了

1203
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
Vostok-1.

1204
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,200
东方1号

1205
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,360
But no one had come for me.

1206
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,360
但没人来找我

1207
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,240
I thought they forgot about me.

1208
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,240
我以为他们把我忘记了

1209
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
The shuttle was launched.

1210
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,280
航天飞机发射了

1211
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,720
Everyone was praying for the shuttle to go through the atmosphere.

1212
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,720
每个人都在祈祷航天飞机穿过大气层

1213
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,800
Only I was praying for it to return half way around to take me.

1214
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,800
只有我在祈祷它能半途而来带我

1215
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,840
And maybe the Americans

1216
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,840
也许美国人

1217
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,280
were praying for Vostok to not go into the space.

1218
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,280
在祈祷Vostok不要进入太空。

1219
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Whatever.

1220
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
随便了

1221
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
All day long

1222
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
那一整天

1223
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,240
near the radio

1224
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,240
在收音机旁边

1225
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,120
I read that poem silently.

1226
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,120
我默默地读那首诗

1227
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,360
My head is a foamy cloud.

1228
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,360
我的头是泡沫状的云

1229
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,200
My inside and outside is a sea.

1230
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,200
我的内外都是大海

1231
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,840
I'm a walnut tree in Gulhane Park.

1232
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,840
我是Gulhane公园的一棵核桃树

1233
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,440
An old walnut tree. With long branches and pieces.

1234
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,440
一棵老核桃树，长着树枝和碎片

1235
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,640
Neither you are aware of this nor is the police.

1236
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:39,640
你和警察都不知道这件事

1237
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,760
I MET A GIRL YESTERDAY. HER NAME WAS NEVRA ELMAS.

1238
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,760
我昨天遇到一个女孩。她的名字叫NEVRA ELMAS

1239
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,120
Whenever I read this poem I feel like I go to space.

1240
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,120
每当我读这首诗时，我都会觉得自己去了太空

1241
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,680
I am 65 years old now.

1242
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:01,680
我今年65岁了

1243
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,000
I made a wish again, just like a child.

1244
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,000
我像个孩子一样再次许愿

1245
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,240
An impossible wish, of course.

1246
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,240
当然是不可能实现的愿望

1247
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,560
Do you know what I wished for?

1248
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,560
你知道我想要什么吗？

1249
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,600
To become a good person.

1250
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,600
我想做个好人

1251
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,640
Dad, I guess you are sleeping.

1252
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,640
爸，我猜你在睡觉

1253
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,360
It's over, I can't tolerate this man no more. We are moving back to Istanbul.

1254
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,360
结束了，我不能再容忍这个人了，我们要搬回伊斯坦布尔

1255
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,680
We are coming together with Deva.

1256
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,680
我和Deva一起回去

1257
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,040
I'll call you later.

1258
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,040
我会再联系你

1259
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,880
Good night.

1260
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:34,880
晚安

1261
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,240
FIRST FEMALE POLICE OFFICER OF HOMICIDE BUREAU

1262
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,240
凶杀局的第一位女警官

1263
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,200
她唯一的目标是成为一个好警察和一个好人

1264
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:55,200
HER ONLY GOAL IS TO BE A GOOD POLICEMAN AND A GOOD PERSON
