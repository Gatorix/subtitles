1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,280
<i>Remember..</i>.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,800
<i>But doctor, I remember everything</i>.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,000
<i>People forget things
when they have Alzheimer's</i>.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,280
<i>But sooner or later,
I will forget things, right</i>?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
<i>All my memories, experiences
will be erased, they will go away</i>.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,720
<i>What will happen to me?
What will happen to my personality</i>?

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,680
<i>Our peaceful, sweet Agah
scolding the waiter</i>.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,160
<i>I can't believe it</i>.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,600
I chose you from 50 girls.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,240
It wasn't because your father was a cop.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,320
<i>How does it feel
to be the only woma</i>n

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,360
<i>working in an homicide bureau
with 140 staff members</i>?

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,320
<i>I've never felt so good</i>.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,280
Dad, I'm getting a divorce.

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,200
<i>It's over, I can't tolerate this man no
more. We are moving back with Deva</i>.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,040
<i>I'm not doing anything, Naimhan.
I haven't done anything</i>.

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>You did it. You and them</i>.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,920
All of you.

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,080
Nevra, why did you bother
to come here?

20
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,520
We could come to you!

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,120
Where do you know me from?

22
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
Who doesn't know you?

23
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,960
You're famous.

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Anyway.

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
What's up? What's the matter?

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,000
If it's within our power,
we'll take care of it.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,560
You'll get cancer.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why did you set fire
to the courthouse?

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,320
I didn't do it.

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,160
You were arrested.

31
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Give a dog a bad name.

32
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,920
I'll beat the rap in the first session,
I'm waiting for it.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
I know you are,

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
but you have set fire to it before.

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,000
Seven years ago.

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,400
That's different. I served my time.

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
<i>Do you know this man</i>?

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Look closely.
His file was in that building.

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,360
They saw his case there.

40
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
Don't know him. Never seen him.

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
Okay.

42
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,400
What did this man do?

43
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
- Killed a judge.
- Damn.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
I thought about it once,

45
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,640
but then I said, never mind.
It's not worth it.

46
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
Didn't do it.

47
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,400
But you set fire to the courthouse
where you worked as a bailiff.

48
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,640
It's a courthouse, love.

49
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,360
It burns, floods, even collapses.

50
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,200
Evidence gets lost.

51
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,480
Case files fly away.

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,600
Let me tell you something, love.

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,880
They must have found
a wretched man like me,

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
gave him some money,
so he sparked a match.

55
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
Look, love.

56
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,360
My town is famous for two things.

57
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,080
The blackest of grape,
and the darkest of man.

58
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,920
That building burns down
every five or ten years, see?

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,440
Let's see if you can find the person who
hired the arsonist, if you have the balls.

60
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,560
Then you'll find out.
I'll be shouting in front of the building.

61
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,400
But they'll all be free
before I finish my words!

62
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,240
And you'll be alone, too!

63
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,200
The defendant, Nevra Elmas!
The plaintiff, Nevra Elmas!

64
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,880
See how you like that?

65
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,600
- What are you doing?
- You're up.

66
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,920
But why did you leave your bed?

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
And you took out your IV needle.

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,920
Come here.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,880
We must alert the nurses.
They told us to call when you woke up.

70
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,040
Where's the car?

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,120
- What car?
- My car, of course. Where is it?

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,160
A tow truck removed it.
They gave us an address.

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,680
The police gave mom
a piece of paper with the address.

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,160
Pick up that paper. We'll get the car.

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
- Now?
- Yes.

76
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
But you just left intensive care.

77
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,520
They took you to a room, and you almost
regained your consciousness.

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,080
- So?
- You mumbled something but we didn't hear.

79
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,960
How? What did I say?

80
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,120
A cat named Munir or something.
You asked about him.

81
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
- You asked if we fed him.
- Huh.

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
Grandpa. Don't you remember anything?

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,080
How you came to the hospital?

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
You had an angiogram.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,240
I remember. I remember everything.

86
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,080
- Come, let's get the car.
- What will you do with it?

87
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,320
I can't leave the car there.
It's a memento from Mebrure.

88
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,200
That's your grandma's car. Come on.

89
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,080
Slowly. This way.

90
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
- There goes my head again.
- Evening, sir.

91
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,760
Good evening, son.
Take me slowly.

92
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,080
- Okay. What's wrong?
- My head's spinning.

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,200
The doctor says walk,
but what good is walking?

94
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,120
Your slippers...
Where are we going?

95
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,440
- We'll get the keys.
- Grandpa...

96
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,120
Dad.

97
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,640
Dad, are you awake?
I'll alert the nurses.

98
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,400
- No, mom. The nurses know.
- They do?

99
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,080
They told him to rest.
The doctor will see him tomorrow.

100
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,800
I'm all right, sweetie.

101
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,920
You gave us such a scare.

102
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,480
What were you doing there
at that time of night?

103
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,960
On the other side of the city.

104
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,000
You left the house,
and didn't tell us anything.

105
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
Where were you going?

106
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,520
I don't know how to tell you this.

107
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,880
I wish I could have said
before... Somehow.

108
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,880
You have the right to know.

109
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
People sometimes

110
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,160
go into a wholly different mood.

111
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,200
They do things
they wouldn't dream of.

112
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
Even I can't recognize myself sometimes.

113
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,640
Wondering how I'd done something.

114
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
But I did.

115
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,640
They happened. All of it.

116
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,400
You'd hear about it one day, anyway.

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,520
I'd rather you hear it from me
than anybody else.

118
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
And then...

119
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,680
It's your decision, my child.

120
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm your father.
And I'm your grandfather.

121
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't you forget that, okay?

122
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
I'm in love, sweetheart.

123
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
- You're in love?
- I have a girlfriend.

124
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
I was at her place that night.

125
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,360
I was on my way back.

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,280
You were on your way...

127
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
What are you saying, dad?

128
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,200
- We made love until morning.
- Ew! What?

129
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,400
Key's still in the ignition, mate!

130
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,200
- You know how to drive?
- We won't be driving it.

131
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,400
- What will we do?
- We'll wreck it to shit.

132
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,440
Sit down. You're making me dizzy.

133
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,520
And? What happened
to the courthouse?

134
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,560
- Who burned it down?
- It looks like the mob, for now.

135
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
Didn't I tell you?

136
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,240
We had a bet.

137
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,920
Don't celebrate yet. It's not certain.

138
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I think that man, Tufan, did it.

139
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,960
But that man, I don't know...

140
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
What?

141
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
Clean since he got out of jail.

142
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
What did he has to do with that judge?

143
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
If only I knew.

144
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
Let me tell you.

145
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,000
If there's no ties between
the victim and the killer,

146
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,960
then it's a hired gun, sweetheart.

147
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,000
He's conducting
somebody else's business.

148
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Yes?

149
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,800
Where?

150
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
On my way.

151
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,920
Another body, right?

152
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,120
See you later.

153
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,080
Of course.

154
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,320
Who's heard of a letter
with one sentence?

155
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,840
That son of a bitch
will keep writing. Nevra!

156
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,960
What is it, dad?

157
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
The man's writing for you to read it.

158
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,680
- Yeah, so?
- So you write him back.

159
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,680
The doctor will be here
to see you in half an hour.

160
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,400
I hope he comes soon
and lets me go. I'm tired.

161
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
In bed all day, with nothing to do.

162
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,000
You didn't bring anything to read, either.

163
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,920
Where's your mom?

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,760
Out. Eating something.

165
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,040
- You have money?
- I do.

166
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
Get me something to read.

167
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
- Okay, but...
- There has to be a bookstore.

168
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,640
I'll wait for the doctor.

169
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,240
No, no. You go now. Now.

170
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,160
- Let me take you to your room.
- I can go myself.

171
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,600
You go, son.

172
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,640
- But what do you want me to buy?
- Well...

173
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,520
The book is called
<i>Life Is Traffic.</i> Buy me that.

174
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,640
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

175
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,520
- Get better soon.
- Thank you.

176
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Terrible thing, being ill.

177
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,720
I hope you get well soon.

178
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
I'm also...

179
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,520
He won't wake up.

180
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Huh.

181
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,760
Yes.

182
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,480
Okay then.

183
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Have a good day.

184
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
- I'm here to visit him.
- You don't say?

185
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,520
How do you know him?

186
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,800
I ONLY TRUST HER.
BECAUSE NEVRA UNDERSTANDS ME.

187
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,880
- Are those your brothers?
- Yes.

188
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
And what do they do?

189
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,880
- They get high.
- That much is clear.

190
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,760
- And they make kites.
- Was the car right there?

191
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,720
No. It was over there.

192
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
All right, kid. Take the boy.

193
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
- Must've been followed.
- Yeah.

194
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,040
Another casing, sir.

195
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,200
Did his job with one bullet in his first.
Now fired six times.

196
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,720
Then again, he also shot
an aquarium in the first one.

197
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,640
The victim has two entry wounds.

198
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,920
Did his eyesight go bad
all of a sudden?

199
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,080
Victim's ID info.

200
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,240
Answer, damn it.

201
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Good, very good.
You found some tire tracks, great.

202
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,000
Finger prints, too. Well done.

203
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
Footprints for the next murder, you say?

204
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,720
There's already an ongoing
country-wide search for him.

205
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,880
And what good is the search?

206
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,720
He kills right under our noses.

207
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,040
If he was afraid of getting caught,

208
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,920
he wouldn't lay his cards
on the table.

209
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,840
He knows he won't be caught.

210
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,720
So there's only one way to catch him:

211
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,880
Find out why
he's committing the murders.

212
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,760
Otherwise you'll go door to door,
asking to yourselves where he is.

213
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
Here.

214
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
You, my office.

215
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,000
I spoke with the prosecutor today.

216
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,240
He doesn't want you involved
in this whatsoever.

217
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
He told me to take you out of this case.

218
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,480
I said "Okay, but maybe the Nevra
on the labels is a different person."

219
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,240
We must take precautions, he says.

220
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,120
He asks if there's a difference between
Nevra and anybody else.

221
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,600
I told him how much difference
it made for me.

222
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,800
I told him what a great
police officer you can be.

223
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,200
In conclusion,
he told me to do what I must.

224
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,600
Do you know what this means?

225
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,760
If the Nevra
this killer is talking about...

226
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,040
is the same Nevra
sitting across the table right now,

227
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,880
and you learn about this,
and don't tell me,

228
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,960
you can't be a police anymore.

229
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,200
Understood, Chief.

230
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Good.

231
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Good.

232
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Out.

233
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,840
Thank you.

234
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,960
I have an idea.

235
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,040
I'm going mad.
I'm about to lose my mind.

236
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,440
Where is this man?

237
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,080
He left his phone, too.

238
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,440
He doesn't use it, anyway.

239
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,200
What's this book
he asked you to buy so urgently?

240
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,600
No idea.

241
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,720
<i>Life Is Traffic</i>, by Nukhet Coban.

242
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,000
Hi. This is Agah's room, isn't it?

243
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,560
Agah, my boy.

244
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,200
What are you up to now?

245
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,120
Our department had this guy, Zekai.

246
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,600
Such a sweet man.

247
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,960
He had a son
who caught pneumonia.

248
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
Very severe.

249
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,360
Doctors said he wouldn't live.
What could Zekai do?

250
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
He lost all hope on doctors.

251
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,920
He visited holy sepulchers,
made offerings.

252
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,280
The boy they said would die,
miraculously recovered.

253
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,440
Zekai, of course,
went to make his offering.

254
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,560
He's made a vow
to make nine paupers happy.

255
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,440
Because his son was nine. Whatever...

256
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,080
He goes to a poor neighborhood.

257
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,240
His money's ready.

258
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,040
He gives the money away.

259
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,480
Makes nine paupers happy.

260
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,080
A tenth pauper appears.
"I'm poor, too." he says.

261
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,000
Zekai says he's out of money,
but the guy won't believe him.

262
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,360
"You gave a fortune away,
where's mine?" he asks.

263
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
- And stabs Zekai.
- Oh, dear.

264
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
Such a pity.

265
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,240
Yes, indeed.

266
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,280
But then, you understand the tenth pauper.

267
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,080
Sure, sure.

268
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,880
You give money to everybody,
and when it's his turn...

269
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
This happens sometimes. I mean...

270
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
There's a crime, but not a criminal.

271
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,400
Hello there.

272
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,240
Agah, sir? What are you doing here?

273
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,160
- Why?
- Everyone's looking for you.

274
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,720
- Has Zuhal left?
- Who?

275
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,680
- I'll go.
- Were you staying here?

276
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,480
- Agah, visit me some time!
- Like hell I will. It's your fault.

277
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,800
Hello, Ates? Can you talk?

278
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,360
Yeah, I'm at work. At the department.

279
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,360
There's this thing. Urgent.
Could you come here?

280
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,000
Nothing to worry about.
Come. I'm waiting.

281
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,360
- Sorry. I had a thing.
- I'm sorry I couldn't come.

282
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,280
To your department, I mean.

283
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,880
They don't like me over there.

284
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,720
It's as close as I can get.

285
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,440
This is for you.

286
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,720
Thanks.

287
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,080
It's cold, though.

288
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,440
I was like this.

289
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
Workaholic.
Coffees went cold all the time.

290
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,280
I may not look like it but I used to be

291
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,040
a fiery and an idealist reporter.

292
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,200
I was a police reporter, too.

293
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
I don't about the fire,

294
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,800
but there's still some idealism left.

295
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,880
Otherwise why would you come
all this way, no?

296
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
Maybe I just wanted to see you.

297
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,360
Why not?

298
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,120
Maybe it's two birds
with one stone. Why not?

299
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,760
Never.

300
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,920
As I am still carrying that idealism,

301
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,040
I am also carrying a stone
for each bird.

302
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,520
- What's this?
- It's a story.

303
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,440
Can you publish it?

304
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,760
"An anonymous law enforcement source."

305
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,400
- Exactly that.
- Hmm.

306
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,920
I gave you this. You're giving it back.

307
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
To me, that's romantic.

308
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,920
- The sooner the better.
- All right.

309
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,520
I'll post it online.

310
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,920
Had a look at the courthouse yet?

311
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,920
I did, but it's a dead end.

312
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,360
Then I could send you
to an entirely different street.

313
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,080
Your dead judge...

314
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,240
All his cases
involved some sort of bribery.

315
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,280
Public knowledge, too.

316
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,200
Might as well have invoiced them.

317
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,280
If you were to look at...

318
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,000
whose lives he'd ruined in those cases,

319
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,160
maybe you'll find something.

320
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,560
But his record is spotless.

321
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,000
Then for one time only,

322
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,280
he didn't take a bribe...

323
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,200
But gave a bribe.

324
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Use your other medicine.
They won't cause a problem.

325
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,520
But sir, you have to
let your daughter know.

326
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Yes, of course.

327
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,200
I must accept it first.

328
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,560
Then I'll tell them both.

329
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,600
Alzheimer's is a serious condition.

330
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,800
Tailor-made for a serious man like myself.

331
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,240
Where were you this morning?

332
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,960
Your daughter worried about you.

333
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
The night I had a heart attack,

334
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,440
I had a sharp pain right here.

335
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,880
I said, "Agah, this is it.
You're leaving this life."

336
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
First thing I thought about

337
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,880
was what my daughter
and grandson was going to do.

338
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,720
What would become of them?

339
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,560
So interesting.

340
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,680
So long as man doesn't understand
that he's dying,

341
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,040
he doesn't think about
those he's leaving behind.

342
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,520
I called my lawyer.

343
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,320
Told him to leave them everything.

344
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,680
They shouldn't have to deal
with the inheritance stuff.

345
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,080
I was busy with those things.

346
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,720
I didn't want to make them sad,
and didn't tell them.

347
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Come in, please.

348
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,040
Let's get to the point.

349
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,000
You'll be our guest for another day.

350
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,240
- Okay?
- Okay.

351
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,520
- All right. Get well soon.
- Thank you.

352
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
You made us leave.

353
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I couldn't ask while he's here.

354
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
What's this thing
you can't share with us?

355
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,240
You know about
the heart attack I had, sweetie?

356
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,880
I asked the doctor about
my sexual life this point on.

357
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,560
Now you know.

358
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,000
Would you have liked to listen?

359
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,280
I wish I could stay.

360
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
No, you go home and rest.

361
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,200
We'll be back tomorrow anyway.

362
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
Dad called today.

363
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,080
Finally, huh.

364
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,720
Finally he must've understand
what he's done.

365
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,400
Doesn't have the face
to call me, either.

366
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,520
So he called you.
What is he saying?

367
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,240
He filed for divorce.

368
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Ah.

369
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
That's a relief.

370
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,840
Really. I'm relieved.

371
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,080
I mean...

372
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,480
That's a load off my shoulder.

373
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,600
I'm happy.

374
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,520
So happy.

375
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
Finally, that's done.

376
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,400
- Mom, you're fine, right?
- Why wouldn't I be?

377
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,200
Good night.

378
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,120
<i>That's not me</i>.

379
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
<i>It's some other Nevra Elmas</i>.

380
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
<i>Or like Firuz had said</i>,

381
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,040
<i>he must have seen me on TV
or the newspaper, and is addressing me</i>.

382
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,680
<i>That may be.
But the real question i</i>s

383
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,160
<i>not whom he's writing,
but why he's writing</i>.

384
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
<i>I think he's alone</i>.

385
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,360
<i>Crippling from it, in fact</i>.

386
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,880
<i>No one to speak with</i>.

387
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,600
<i>Even if he does, nobody's listening</i>.

388
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,600
<i>He wants to be
listened to so badly</i>,

389
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,520
<i>he's willing to kill for it</i>.

390
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,040
MISSING SUSPECT

391
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,880
<i>Who could be that lonely</i>?

392
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,840
Zuhal? Darling?

393
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Mister? Mister?

394
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,680
Are you okay, mister?

395
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,400
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

396
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,840
What brought you here, at this hour?

397
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,320
I've come to take my car.
They towed it here.

398
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,920
Come tomorrow.

399
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,040
No. Tomorrow won't do.

400
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm coming from the hospital.
I have somebody sick.

401
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,520
I have to take the car there,
and go to their hometown.

402
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,240
I wish them well.
Where are you from?

403
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,280
- Mister. Are you feeling better?
- Yeah.

404
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,280
We've called an ambulance.
They'll be here soon.

405
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
What?

406
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
What are you saying?

407
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,680
- In the car.
- What's there?

408
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,120
In the bag...

409
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,880
- What's there?
- In the bag...

410
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,000
Mister...

411
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,120
- Mister.
- In the car...

412
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,960
- What?
- My car.

413
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,960
<i>This second murder is really
making national headlines</i>.

414
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,160
<i>While the nationwide search for the
killer, Tufan Elibol, is still ongoing</i>,

415
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,280
<i>it is believed that
he may not be acting alone</i>,

416
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,520
<i>and that he may have two
or three accomplices</i>.

417
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,680
<i>According to the anonymous
law enforcement source</i>,

418
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,720
<i>these murders may have
nothing to do with Tufan Elibol</i>.

419
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,680
<i>Indeed, dear viewers,
he may be a victim of them</i>.

420
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,840
Hey!

421
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,440
You sissy!

422
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,040
I'll make you pay for this!

423
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,080
Bloody hell. Hey!

424
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,680
Screw this.

425
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,920
Fuck! Fuck this!

426
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,680
- Help!
- What are you doing?

427
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,440
What are you doing?
You'll break the elevator.

428
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,040
- Stop it.
- Help!

429
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,840
Stop! You'll cut your hand.
Don't bang on the glass.

430
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,040
Help me!

431
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,200
What are you doing?
Why are you yelling for nothing?

432
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,960
Open it.
I can't hear you, open this.

433
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,040
Sir, I beg you. Let me go,
I won't go to the police.

434
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,600
- I'll go home.
- Okay. That's what I'm saying.

435
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,880
- I beg you, sir.
- If you'll let me finish...

436
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,560
- Just...
- I... Shut the hell up!

437
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Now...

438
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,760
The mechanic says...

439
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,040
When the elevator is stuck
between two floors,

440
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
press on the call button once.

441
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,760
If it doesn't move,

442
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,960
it's something only
the mechanic could fix.

443
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,280
I can't kill you here.

444
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,880
How will I remove your body?

445
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,080
Help me! Help!

446
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,440
So, let me tell you how we'll do this.

447
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,920
I'll press this button once.

448
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
Just the one time.

449
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,800
If it doesn't come down, you'll live.

450
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,800
I'll go to the police,
and that's that.

451
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,840
What if it works?

452
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,200
What if it comes down?

453
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,200
Well...

454
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,800
Then...

455
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,440
I'll have to do
something I won't like at all.

456
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,280
- I'll have to kill you.
- Ah, man!

457
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,880
Help!

458
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,240
Help!

459
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,280
I think Nevra spotted our ruse, anyway.

460
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,360
I don't really need you anymore.

461
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,960
Very interesting.

462
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,120
These things really do happen.

463
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,680
A turning point.

464
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,240
All right.

465
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
Well...

466
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
Are you ready?

467
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,160
Can anybody hear me?

468
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,720
Anybody?

469
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,320
Come here. Fuck you.

470
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,720
- Help me!
- I'm pressing the button.

471
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,720
- Let's see how it goes.
- Anybody!

472
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,080
Pure luck.

473
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,200
- Can anybody hear me?
- I'm pressing.

474
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,080
Fuck this.

475
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,280
Help!

476
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
No!

477
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,880
Think of your health.

478
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,360
A little exercise won't kill you.

479
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,960
Why are you in the elevator?

480
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
Just use the stairs.

481
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,840
See?

482
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,240
It's bad for the heart.

483
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,480
Why aren't you answering?

484
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,080
That's why you've come?

485
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,240
Yes, mom.

486
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,920
How'd you like it, mom?

487
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,960
Beautiful, isn't it?

488
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,880
You have a lovely room.

489
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,000
I'll always call you.

490
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,760
Everyday.

491
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,240
The director's here, madam.

492
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,400
Mom, I'll speak
to the director and be back.

493
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
Okay?

494
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,680
- These should be with her.
- Of course.

495
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,920
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of her.

496
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,280
- Thanks. You'll be here, then?
- Yes. I'll help her move in.

497
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,680
Mom, I'll be back soon.

498
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,120
Oh, poor Agah.

499
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,320
What have you done?
