1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Remember the "Personality".

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,360
I met a girl today.
Her name is Nevra Elmas.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,360
Do you have something
to tell me Binnaz?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,360
She is the only one I trust.
Because Nevra understands me.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,440
It's Nevra's birthday today.
I got her a present.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
Has your brother Tayyar
ever mentioned a girl named Reyhan?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,520
He used to say "they wasted her",
not "I wasted her".

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,640
I told you, I haven't done anything.
I only threw a small piece of stone.

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,240
Me and Nevra share a secret.

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,360
Cemil almost owns
whole of Kambura.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,640
Nothing ever takes place
without his knowledge.

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,400
If it is as precious as to be
hidden under a pillow...

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
it was more likely a diary.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
I told Nevra everything.
But she doesn't believe me.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
You are not speaking
to your friend in Ankara.

16
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,360
I don't think you should ever
speak to him again anyway.

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,160
Save his a..ss
and save your own.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,080
We need someone to sort him out.

19
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,880
I will burn that gypsy so bad they
will ever dare to return to Kambura.

20
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,280
Tayyar remembers you.

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
He said "they wasted
the poor girl".

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Hello Reyhan.

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,920
If Tayyar remembers,
so do the others.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,840
All of them, they all remember.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,800
Whole of Kambura remembers.

26
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,080
They just pretend
that they don't.

27
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,440
Don't pull the trigger.

28
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
Because I won't.

29
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,640
The scene will be catastrophic,
God forbid if one of these glasses break.

30
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
So intriguing.

31
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,400
Once I saved a fish's live.

32
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,440
Now they are saving my life.

33
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,680
I don't think you've come here
to kill me anyway.

34
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,480
I tell you what's best...

35
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,760
we both put the guns down...

36
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,600
and start from scratch.

37
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
Right from the beginning.

38
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,320
Nevra, where are you?

39
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,520
I am at the station in Kambura.

40
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,336
The girl we're looking for
is definitely Reyhan.

41
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll tell you when I come back
but I have to stay here another day.

42
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,160
Nevra...

43
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,920
chief Tolga is suspended.

44
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
Are you serious? Why?

45
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,480
We don't know.

46
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,200
Nobody knows. Firuz will
take his place temporarily.

47
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,320
The chief is packing up today. I think you
should be here to say your farewells.

48
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,520
O.K.

49
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,616
He tells me to organize a fancy dress
party where all the guests are...

50
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,280
dressed in " Dog Killer" costumes.

51
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,000
He says "bring the gun too.
I'll be there to finish somebody off".

52
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,360
What shall I do? Set up a party?

53
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,880
You're right. But let's say we don't
cooperate. The guy killed 11 people.

54
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,080
Do you think
he'd leave me alone?

55
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,240
- Hi guys.
- Hi mum.

56
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,640
Deva...

57
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,000
can I talk to you in private?

58
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
O.K

59
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,080
See you later SÃ¼veyda.

60
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,680
What is so important?

61
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Your dad called.

62
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
What did he say?

63
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840
He says me misses us.

64
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,840
So?

65
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,440
So...

66
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
he wants us back.

67
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,160
He says he'll book
and pay for our flight.

68
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
"Otherwise I'll come and
get you myself" he says.

69
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
So, he is planning to kidnap us.

70
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,840
Not exactly. But you know your dad.
He can be very impatient.

71
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,080
But he doesn't care
about what we want.

72
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,120
And what did you tell him?

73
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,200
"Deva started school and I found a job.
We have a new life now."

74
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,040
Didn't you tell him that?

75
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,440
Of course I did.

76
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,920
But he says "don't worry, school is not a
big issue, we'll figure something out".

77
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,560
Mum...

78
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,880
that's exactly why my dad
wanted to get divorced.

79
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,280
He had enough of you going
along with everything he said.

80
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,320
As if he was your only
connection with life.

81
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,040
He was suffocating because
you made him feel like...

82
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,480
the world revolved around him.

83
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
And now he is upset
because we are not there.

84
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,560
That's normal, because
he's got no one to boss around.

85
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,080
The person you call "that man"
is your father. He looked after me.

86
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
Your mum is ill, son.

87
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
I know.

88
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,200
Your mum is an alcoholic.

89
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,920
I'll still be an alcoholic
even if I quit drinking.

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
That's how it will always be.

91
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,760
And your father put up with me.
He looked after me. Understand?

92
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Your illness has got nothing
to do with being alcoholic.

93
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
Your problem is something else.

94
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,000
You become the slave of whoever
looks after you. That's your illness.

95
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
You are addicted to people,
not alcohol.

96
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,680
Girls!

97
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,880
What are you doing?

98
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,800
You've said it was impossible.
How did it happen?

99
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,880
I have been looking
at the wrong floor.

100
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
I should've been looking
further up.

101
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,920
- How much further up?
- Very much.

102
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,720
That's why I am telling you the pack it in.
Because it's too dangerous.

103
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,760
Do you remember when
we were at the university?

104
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Remember the dreams we had?

105
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,560
Sure I do. We were planning
to change the world.

106
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
But what happened?
We changed our world.

107
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,520
I can't breathe here. Not enough oxygen.
I want to go back to school days.

108
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
It's up to you.

109
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,240
What are you going to do now?

110
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll arrest him. What else?
Just tell me, is it really him?

111
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,640
99 percent. But you won't
go in alone, will you?

112
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,920
At least let chief Tolga know.

113
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
From now on, I am the one
to be reported to.

114
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,920
Tolga is suspended.
I am replacing him.

115
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,400
- Are you serious?
- It was inevitable.

116
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,600
Look at me, I am working
like a donkey.

117
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,080
All Tolga was doing
laying on his back.

118
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
You are a dodgy man.
You've got it in for Nevra.

119
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,840
Didn't you say you'll catch the man
before she does?

120
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,440
- See this?
- What?

121
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,080
The mark left by Nevra's slap.

122
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,360
I see it every morning
when I look at the mirror.

123
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,520
It is Zuhal.

124
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,160
Strange.

125
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,440
Hello? Hi Zuhal.

126
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,840
Yes, he is here.

127
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,000
Hang on.

128
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
O.K darling.

129
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,120
Zuhal, how are you sweetheart?

130
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,280
Pardon?

131
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,000
What do you mean?

132
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
So sudden?

133
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
Dear oh dear!

134
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,400
Why?

135
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
O.K, I see.

136
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,200
We'll talk later.

137
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
O.K, I've got to go.

138
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,040
My silly daughter.

139
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,200
What is it?
Something bad happened?

140
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,280
They are going back.

141
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,000
- Where?
- Australia.

142
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
Immediately.

143
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,000
Such a shame.
You only just got back together.

144
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,240
She said "urgent".
Did something bad happened?

145
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,400
- She made up with her husband.
- That's nice.

146
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
That's good news.

147
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,120
It is so sudden.

148
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,920
I've just gotten used to them.

149
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,160
Is it alright if we leave tonight?
I want to see them.

150
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,160
That's fine.
I'll go and pack my suitcase.

151
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Agah...

152
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
don't be upset.

153
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,240
It was nice to have somebody around,
a voice in the house.

154
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,040
Now, I'll go back to being alone.

155
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
I am ready. We can go.

156
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,440
We can leave right away.
No rush. Let's eat first.

157
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,240
Then we can leave.

158
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,160
Boss...

159
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,640
you can take it to the
administrative court...

160
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,240
even all the way
to council of state.

161
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,080
There'll be no use.

162
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,440
What are you going to do?

163
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,440
First, I have to remove the sand bag.
But it's not going to be easy.

164
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,400
Then I'll go and
see may children.

165
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,880
I'll say to them "daddy is back,
I'll be home from now on".

166
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,280
"The never-ending shift has finally
ended. Your dad is here now".

167
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,856
That's what I'll say to them.
Then I'll go to sleep.

168
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
This is the plan for time being.

169
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,280
Do you want to know how I feel?

170
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,400
There are things in life that you rely on
when you are in trouble.

171
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,240
For example, 155.
Police emergency.

172
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,280
Or if there is a fire, you know that
fire brigade will attend.

173
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,096
If you're stuck in an elevator
you push the emergency button...

174
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,320
and talk to someone.

175
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,400
There are panic buttons.

176
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,080
You push them and talk to police
or whoever.

177
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,480
All of these give you
a piece of mind.

178
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,880
Just imagine that
none of these works.

179
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,120
You dial 155 but no answer.

180
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,200
There is a fire. You call the fire
brigade but no one shows up.

181
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,160
You are stuck in an elevator. You push
the button to talk to someone.

182
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,440
Panic button for example.

183
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,760
You push it and shout
"is there anybody there".

184
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,400
But no answer.

185
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,120
You start to think there is
something wrong.

186
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,840
You snap it off the wall,
take a look and...!

187
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,600
What the f... cuk!

188
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,760
The wires are not connected.

189
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,960
There are no wires. Just a thing
that was mounted on the wall.

190
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,400
You've spent your life by trusting it.
But they put it there to deceive you.

191
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Just trust it. Don't ask questions. Just do
your job. That's what it is there for.

192
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,680
But you've been fool enough
to trust it.

193
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,800
There was nothing to trust.
That's how I feel now.

194
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,280
I believed in things for nothing.
And that's what really bugs me.

195
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,640
I don't know what to do now.

196
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,720
All right lads...

197
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,400
you know, I always say to you...

198
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,720
our job...

199
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,480
I mean your job...

200
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,440
is saving lives.

201
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,120
That's why, there is no resting for you
until the last killer is caught.

202
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,280
It means that you'll never rest.

203
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,960
Because there will
always be a killer on the loose.

204
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,680
You knowingly choose a difficult life, so
that people you don't even know...

205
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,320
can sleep peacefully
in their beds.

206
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,320
You swore to sacrifice your lives for
people you don't know...

207
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,360
so justice in this sh... tty world
can prevail.

208
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,360
It was an honour to work
with you guys.

209
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,600
And you should be proud
of yourselves.

210
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Because...

211
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,640
dedicating a life to justice
is not a personal matter.

212
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,680
It is the matter of personality.

213
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Take care.

214
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
S... t!

215
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
What do you want?

216
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,560
Another fairy-tale?
Is that why you're calling?

217
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,280
You hung Reyhan's photo everywhere.
It says on it "do you remember".

218
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,440
What has it got to do with you?

219
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,240
Find Sungur Demirci. He is the one
who best remembers.

220
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,080
He was pimping Reyhan.

221
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Pimping?

222
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,160
How do you know?
My husband told me.

223
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,520
You were right Nevra.
I married the man who raped me.

224
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
Sefa...

225
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,960
is there a Sungur Demirci among men
whom you investigate in Kambura?

226
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Sungur.

227
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,840
Let's see.

228
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,560
Sungur Demirci.

229
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,560
We already took a
statement from him.

230
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,520
- What does he do?
- He said "marketing".

231
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,440
We are going to Kambura.

232
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Go on, pass.

233
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Go on.

234
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,920
Isn't he the...?

235
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,440
Yes, that's him.

236
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,400
Agah, can you slow down please?

237
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,160
- We are already slow.
- Make it slower please.

238
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,880
You know I don't like speed.

239
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Agah!

240
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,200
I feel very uncomfortable.
Please slow down.

241
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,000
There is a truck right ahead.
What are you doing?

242
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
I want to get off.
Are you alright Agah?

243
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,360
Can you pull over? I want to get off.
I feel very uncomfortable.

244
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,320
Agah, please. I want to get off.

245
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,600
What are you doing? Slow down.
You're going to kill us.

246
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
What are you doing?
You're going to kill us.

247
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Agah!

248
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,240
I apologize.

249
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,000
You've made me relive the most horrific
moment of my life.

250
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,840
- How could you?
- I apologize.

251
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,000
You are not what you appear to be.
Who are you?

252
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't want to know anyway.
Just leave it at that.

253
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
There is a saying...

254
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,000
don't complain about the traffic.
Because you are the traffic.

255
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,600
You were not the only guilty party.
I was guilty too.

256
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,640
I wished that tango we had
that night would last forever.

257
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,120
Let's dance forever.
Let's tango forever.

258
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,680
But the music had stopped long ago
and I never knew it.

259
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
I apologize.

260
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,120
What is this? What's going on?

261
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Get out.

262
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,920
I've been following you for hours
and you knew it.

263
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
Don't pretend that
you are surprized.

264
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,280
Shut the door.

265
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,840
Easy.

266
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
What do you want, money?

267
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,920
Amazing...

268
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
eleven murders.

269
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,840
What murder?

270
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,120
I must admit,
you don't fit in the type.

271
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,080
I don't know you.

272
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,480
You know rookie
deputy superintendent Nevra.

273
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,440
You keep texting her.

274
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,120
But you don't know Firuz, the fastest
slinger in the whole homicide.

275
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,960
Of course you know me.
You know me like f... ck.

276
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,440
Well done to you. I mean it.

277
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,720
This is how a serial killer
should be.

278
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,680
He should know the cops
who are after him...

279
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,960
so he can run.

280
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,160
Can I see your badge?

281
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,960
Who are you kidding?
Me or yourself?

282
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,480
Or both of us?

283
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,640
Can I see your badge?

284
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Is it O.K?

285
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,080
Are you arresting me?
Are we going down the station?

286
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,480
We are going straight
to the court.

287
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,200
- What do you mean by court?
- I mean you'll talk.

288
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,720
You'll confess. You'll tell.

289
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,400
You used to work in the courthouse.
You know how it goes.

290
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,040
You'll talk and I'll listen.

291
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,320
I am not telling you anything.

292
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,600
You either take me down to the station
or this is a kidnap.

293
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,520
Do you know the minimum?

294
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,600
I don't think we can see
eye to eye.

295
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,000
I am telling you, it is over.

296
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,960
You are caught. Understand?

297
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,200
I have 40 evidence that says
Agah BeyoÄlu killed all those people.

298
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,240
Now, it is about time you tell me why
you are so interested in Kambura.

299
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,440
I am not telling you anything.

300
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,920
You can take me down to the station
and provide me with a lawyer.

301
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,640
Well, well, well.

302
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,720
I think you've been watching
too many movies.

303
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,120
I can provide you with somebody else
instead of a lawyer.

304
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,800
How about...

305
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,240
your daughter?

306
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Zuhal.

307
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,000
How do you know Zuhal?

308
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,040
I have DNA analysis. And you are
asking me how I know your daughter.

309
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,120
I know her from a different place.
But it is a different subject.

310
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,656
What do you mean
by different subject?

311
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,880
How do you know Zuhal?

312
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Shall we go and ask her in person?

313
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,760
She can sit right beside you...

314
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,520
instead of a lawyer.

315
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,400
She can sit very close to you.

316
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,000
Then I shoot her in the head.

317
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,840
Her blood splashes on your face.

318
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,456
Perhaps you confess while your
daughter's blood is running down...

319
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
your face.

320
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,880
What do you think?

321
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,160
Where do you think Zuhal is now?
Home or work?

322
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,800
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this?

323
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,880
I've a little debt to pay off.

324
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,600
Who knows? I may even
become a payee after all.

325
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,840
If you do anything to Zuhal...

326
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,120
cause her any harm...

327
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,680
I'll make you suffer so much
before I kill you...

328
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,960
you'd wish you were never born.

329
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,520
Do you understand me son?

330
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Yeah, sure.

331
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,960
I am doing my deed...

332
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,280
giving you a little warning.

333
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,200
You are not going anywhere.
What do you mean you're leaving?

334
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,240
You're going nowhere.
I won't let you.

335
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
Look...

336
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,480
you did me good.
I won't let you go.

337
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
Cemil, think sensibly.

338
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,640
O.K, we have a thing going.
But Deva has a future there.

339
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,000
I have a house there.

340
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,960
I'll bring that house down Zuhal.

341
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
What?

342
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,400
O.K, that's good.

343
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,000
Where are you now?

344
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,760
I'll be there right away.

345
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,000
First, we have to sort out
our own issues.

346
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
Then I'll deliver the goods.

347
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
- What do you want?
- We'll talk about it.

348
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
Who is this man?
What's his problem?

349
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,440
I don't know.
But we'll find out.

350
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,120
I'll let you know
if we come to a deal.

351
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
B... stard!

352
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,280
What is it, something bad?

353
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,240
Yes, it is.
He does exactly the same.

354
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,400
Who is he? What's going on?

355
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,120
You're all the same.
First, you make me believe things.

356
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,080
Then you betray me.

357
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,800
What did I do to you?

358
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,320
Nothing but favours.

359
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
Shame on you.

360
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,560
You are nothing
like your father.

361
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
I hope whoever is behind this
slander rots in hell.

362
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,040
I know nothing about pimping.

363
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,880
What are you talking about?

364
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,320
Now Mr Sungur, if you're going
to be all tensed up...

365
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,960
we can take you down the station
where you can relax a bit.

366
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,560
Look, officers...

367
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,280
I have nothing to do
with pimping or anything.

368
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,920
Tell me, how did you manage to
disguise yourself all these years?

369
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,720
You have no criminal record.

370
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,280
I wonder if you happen to
know a judge or something.

371
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,120
For instance, Mehmet Yurtgil.

372
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,280
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't.

373
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,120
I don't know any judge.

374
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,040
Nevra...

375
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,440
can you excuse us for a minute?

376
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,000
Look, I swear I know nothing.
I don't know Reyhan or any other girl.

377
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,960
You can ask anybody.

378
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,440
I am not involved
in anything like that.

379
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,720
We did ask.
They said you are a pimp.

380
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,440
F... cking b..stards.

381
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,360
Yes, you're right. Unfortunately
you can never trust people.

382
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,400
I myself was a victim of a slander once.
That's how I know.

383
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,600
Once, we detained a man who later
claimed that we tortured him.

384
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,560
I said no way.

385
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,840
Son of a b... tch even got
a report from a hospital...

386
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,360
claiming that we broke
his bones.

387
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,040
I said he probably did it himself.

388
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,960
Banging his arms and legs to a wall.

389
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,680
He was planning
to take us to court.

390
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,480
Luckily internal affairs ruled out
investigation and the case closed.

391
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,040
Appropriate outcome.

392
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,560
Yeah, otherwise.
We would've been in deep shit.

393
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,000
That's why I understand you.
Being falsely accused is a bad thing.

394
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,480
Because I had not
broken any bones.

395
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,760
I had stuck a truncheon up his a..s
instead.

396
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,880
I think he was too ashamed
to tell the doctors.

397
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,160
I wouldn't be so upset
if he told the truth.

398
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,840
But he was lying.

399
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,920
He was saying I broke his arm.

400
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,920
So, your wife has passed away.

401
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,640
Yes, she's gone.
May she rest in peace.

402
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,840
What do you do about cooking?

403
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,520
There is a girl.
She comes around and does it for me.

404
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,240
Do you like pastry,
like, pies and things?

405
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,640
- Yeah, I do.
- Good.

406
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
So, you must have a rolling pin.

407
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,800
O.K Mr Agah, spill the beans.
What's your problem with Kambura?

408
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
It was 1995.

409
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,760
I was transferred to
Kambura Court House.

410
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,120
In the beginning
everything was good.

411
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,520
People were pleasant
and hospitable.

412
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,240
And Kambura was a nice place.

413
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,880
I said to my late wife that
we came to a nice place...

414
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,840
that we are out of the
hustle-bustle of Istanbul.

415
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
In 1996...

416
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,040
a 14 year old girl
committed suicide.

417
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,560
She used to live with her granny.

418
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,520
Poor girl was an orphan.

419
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,240
Her name was Reyhan.

420
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,400
I received the file.

421
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,760
The police report said
"heavy depression".

422
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,640
And the case was closed.

423
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,880
One day, her granny turned up,
holding a notebook.

424
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,160
She said it belonged to her grandchild
but couldn't read it as she was illiterate.

425
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,600
She said her grandchild wouldn't
take her life in her own accord.

426
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,400
She said something
must've happened to her.

427
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,400
She said it may be in this notebook.
I want you to take a look.

428
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,840
And so I did.

429
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,440
It was her diary.

430
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,800
She'd written down everything.

431
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,840
Every single name in Kambura
was in the diary.

432
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,440
Even from outside.

433
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,360
For example, a judge.

434
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,320
He used to visit Kambura
every now and then.

435
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,360
So, he knew too.

436
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,160
Judges, teachers...

437
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
crooks, cops...

438
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,600
poor and the rich...

439
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,440
the educated, the ignorant...

440
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,520
She was only 12 years old
at the time.

441
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,440
Only 12.

442
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,720
- Reyhan stop.
- Stay away.

443
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Reyhan!

444
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
- Don't.
- Away!

445
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,840
Reyhan, stop.

446
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Away!

447
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Let me go.

448
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,080
Let me go.

449
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,560
For 2 years...

450
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,360
all these men
raped the poor girl.

451
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
53 of them in total.

452
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,680
The poor girl couldn't take it anymore
and she took her own life.

453
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,720
She'd become anybody's item.

454
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,720
I don't know who but apparently a
boy gives her a false hope of marriage.

455
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,440
He makes a move on her.

456
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,360
She doesn't decline, thinking that they
were going to get married anyway.

457
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,200
Then he begins to threaten her,
forcing her to be with others too.

458
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,440
She gets frightened.

459
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,120
She thinks it will be
just a one-time thing.

460
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,240
But the men keep coming,
one after the other.

461
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,560
Like flies around honey.

462
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,520
Then they brought her to me.

463
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
I thought I could
make some cash.

464
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,520
We have a barn just over there.

465
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,760
She worked for couple of months.
Then she killed herself.

466
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,240
You s..n of a b... tc!

467
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,440
I am going to ruin
your f... cking life.

468
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,520
S..n of a b... tch!

469
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,800
What did you do
after reading the diary?

470
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,840
What can I do?
I had an 11-year-old daughter.

471
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,040
I thought I should move her away.
So, I sent her to a boarding school.

472
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,520
She had to get out of Kambura.
Because these men were everywhere.

473
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,480
What did you do about Reyhan?

474
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,280
Didn't you hand the diary over to D.A?
No trial was set?

475
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,520
I was going to hand it to the D.A.
But his name was in the diary too.

476
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,480
My hand was tied. I was scared.

477
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,480
There were so many of them.
And I was just a simple civil servant.

478
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,080
I thought they can
walk all over me.

479
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,760
The girl was gone anyway. What's the
use of taking the case to the court?

480
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,480
It was not going
to bring her back.

481
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,520
F..cking sh... t!

482
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,560
After a while, I got transferred
to Istanbul.

483
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,960
But I never forgot about Reyhan.

484
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,000
I left Kambura. But I was never
able to leave Reyhan.

485
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,560
10 years ago, I bought a gun.

486
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,040
I wanted to kill someone.

487
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,760
I tried but failed.

488
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,640
I tried again...

489
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,600
but failed again.

490
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,960
What made you
start killing them all?

491
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
I was diagnosed with
Alzheimer's Disease.

492
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,520
I thought to myself
"you are running out of time".

493
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,760
It will come a day
you'll forget about Reyhan.

494
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,920
You'll forget about Reyhan who has
been in your mind for 22 years.

495
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,920
Was Cemil Havran in the diary too?
Is that why you went to him?

496
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Whole of Kambura
took care of him.

497
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,840
Business owners, civil servants.

498
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,880
I even paid for son of a b... tch's
private lessons.

499
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,840
It turned out that he was pimping
the girl to return the favours.

500
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,320
Most names in the diary belonged
to those who helped Cemil.

501
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,920
Just give me a f... cking break.

502
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Hello?

503
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,960
I am listening doctor.

504
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,320
O.K, we'll be on our way.

505
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,520
I am bringing him.

506
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Are we going?

507
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Are we going?

508
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
Come on.

509
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,440
- You are staying here.
- What?

510
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,960
Why are you not taking me?

511
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,360
Take me to the station.

512
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,720
Why are you leaving me here?
Firuz!

513
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,640
Why did you leave me here?

514
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,240
I told Nevra everything.

515
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,080
But she doesn't believe me.

516
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,200
Wish they all die.

517
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,320
They are, Reyhan.

518
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,680
Don't you worry about it.

519
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,320
All dying.

520
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Hello?

521
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Hello?

522
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,920
I want to ask you something.

523
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,480
In Naz ÃÃ¶rtÃ¼k's case, there was a
drop of blood on the floor...

524
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,960
but away from the victim.

525
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,800
As if it belonged
to somebody else.

526
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,760
It may belong to the killer.

527
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,720
Has anything come out of it?

528
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,120
Drop of blood?

529
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,120
There was no such a thing
in the report.

530
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,480
It is not in your report.
But I can see it in the photo.

531
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,720
I told you I was there
before the cops arrived.

532
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,680
It keeps boggling my mind.
I thought I'd ask you.

533
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,040
- Where are you anyway?
- Kambura.

534
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,200
I'll drop by tomorrow and take the photo
from you before I go the station.

535
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
O.K.

536
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,800
- Nevra?
- What?

537
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,280
I love you.

538
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,360
Nevra?

539
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,720
I think I am standing outside the house
we once lived years ago.

540
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
Can I call you later AteÅ?

541
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,000
O.K.

542
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,360
Did you check your room Nevra?
Make sure you got everything.

543
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,320
I got everything mum.

544
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,880
I'll return the key to the landlord.
Then we can get going.

545
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,440
I am going to meet Reyhan.
I want to see her for the last time.

546
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,520
Go on. But don't be late.

547
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,120
O.K.

548
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,080
We've got a long way to go.
I want to get there before the evening.

549
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
Nevra?

550
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,600
Come with me.

551
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,760
We are leaving.
Mum told me not to be late.

552
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,840
We'll make it quick.

553
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,680
Where are we going?

554
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,080
I am going to meet him in the woods.
I want you to meet him.

555
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,360
But you can't tell anybody, O.K?

556
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,160
O.K, promise. Come on.

557
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Firuz!

558
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Firuz!

559
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,360
Who is there?

560
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,760
Anybody there?

561
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Firuz...

562
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,080
son...

563
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,280
why are you keeping me here?

564
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,440
Take me to the station, arrest me
and let's get on with it.

565
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Shut up!

566
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
Don't talk.

567
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,560
The last one...

568
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,880
for the last time.

569
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
What?

570
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,120
You will kill for the last time.

571
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Who?

572
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,240
Cemil.

573
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,960
Son, are you alright?

574
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,480
And I'll never hear
your name again.

575
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,080
Or I'll come to your house...

576
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,600
and rip your heart out.

577
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,200
Do you understand?

578
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,200
If you get caught,
I don't know you.

579
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,600
If you don't get caught...

580
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,320
I'll forget about you,
and you'll forget about me.

581
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,560
I killed so many people.
It was all over the papers.

582
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,520
Police will never
stop chasing me.

583
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,800
You...

584
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,160
do you think you are the only one
with Alzheimer's Disease?

585
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,560
Everybody is sick.

586
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
They're all sick.

587
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,520
Come an international match,
everybody will forget about everything.

588
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,680
This nation forgot so many things.

589
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,760
You won't be an exception.

590
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,880
Who do you think you are anyway?

591
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,720
You are just a killer,
a murder case in the news.

592
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,840
Why are you doing this?

593
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,440
Cemil...

594
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,040
he owns a hospital.

595
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,080
My son is being treated there
since he was born.

596
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,560
It doesn't cost me a penny.

597
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,280
Cemil wouldn't do
anything for nothing.

598
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,960
True.

599
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,360
He got me in return.

600
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,840
I made a promise to myself.

601
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,520
I said, if something happens
to my son...

602
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,440
Cemil will die.

603
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,440
My son...

604
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,480
my son died today.

605
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,360
He was unable to leave
the operating table alive.

606
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,520
Now...

607
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,360
I'll call Cemil.

608
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,600
I'll tell him that you escaped.

609
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
I won't reveal your I.D.

610
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,960
Now, go and kill him.

611
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
And then, disappear.

612
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,120
- I will have another gift in my hand.
- What is it?

613
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,800
<i>- I will have another gift in my hand.
- What is it</i>?

614
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,680
<i>Then I'll ask your granddad</i>.

615
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Good morning.

616
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
Good morning.

617
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,800
I was trying to call you.

618
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,320
I have to leave.

619
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,520
I'll meet ex-chief Tolga.

620
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,800
Chief Tolga?

621
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,520
Are you in touch with him?
I'll tell you all about it.

622
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,960
Shall we meet at the
same cafÃ© tomorrow?

623
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,040
The one near you.

624
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,920
Alright.

625
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Fine.

626
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,520
AteÅ!

627
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,240
The photo?

628
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,440
Sorry.

629
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,160
I made coffee for you.
There is food too.

630
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,040
Eat before you go.

631
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,320
I can help myself. Thanks.

632
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,400
See you.

633
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
See you.

634
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,720
AteÅ!

635
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,560
I found something Nevra.

636
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,840
Something very big.

637
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,440
But I have to tell Tolga first.
Is that O.K?

638
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,640
AteÅ!

639
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,320
I love you too.

640
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,760
Oh, yeah!

641
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,040
Nevra!

642
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,080
Life is good.

643
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,480
1 Week Later.

644
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Where?

645
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,040
What's going on?

646
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Is this earthquake? What is it?

647
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,360
It is night already.
I went to bed in the afternoon.

648
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,320
The time...

649
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,720
half past two.

650
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,560
I must've been sleeping for ages.

651
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,720
Bloody music is still going.

652
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,320
They are bouncing up and down
like donkeys.

653
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,160
I've had enough of this s... it.

654
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,280
Nevra Elmas, the only female detective
in homicide...

655
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,240
handed her resignation today.

656
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,400
She was one of the most mediatic faces
of the police force.

657
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,600
The reason behind her decision
is not known yet.

658
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,720
I said everything will be turned off
by 2 a.m.

659
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,440
What is this, a nightclub?

660
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,640
What is this?

661
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,920
- I got it for you today.
- Why?

662
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,280
We are leaving dad.
You'll be here all alone.

663
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,040
It will be a company for you.

664
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,520
I can't believe all that happened
while I was asleep.

665
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,680
Everybody must've been
waiting for this.

666
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,280
You have been asleep for ages.
I didn't want to wake you up.

667
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,280
It must've been an exhausting vacation
with Miss NÃ¼khet.

668
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,960
Do you think it is the medication
that is making you sleepy?

669
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,600
They say it can make
you feel sleepy.

670
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,880
Where are you going dad?

671
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,696
There was a photo of me and your mum
over there. Where did you put it?

672
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,040
It is still here.

673
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,320
I moved it back
to its old place.

674
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,720
Where are you going?

675
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,240
Downstairs. To find out
what the hell is going on.

676
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,600
Deva and his friends are
having a farewell party.

677
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,200
They are enjoying themselves.
Leave them.

678
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,160
They can enjoy themselves
somewhere else.

679
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,440
Do I go to their house
and bounce up and down?

680
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,600
Bloody hell! What a waste of a
generation.

681
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,000
She got me a TV.

682
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,960
As if I am not capable of
getting one myself.

683
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,080
I don't want it. Simple as that.

684
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:46,440
Look at that. They shut the door
supposedly keep the noise in.

685
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,120
It is f... cking full blast. It's going
to bring the whole building down.

686
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,200
Open it.

687
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,200
What's going on here?

688
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,040
Why are you dressed like this?

689
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,480
Deva!

690
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,640
Deva!

691
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,400
Is Deva here?

692
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,720
Deva!

693
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,520
Deva!

694
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Deva!

695
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,640
Deva!

696
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Deva!

697
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,400
Deva!

698
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,320
Deva!

699
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,440
Deva!

700
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,680
Let me through.

701
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,000
Let me through.

702
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,440
How dare you call me bitch?

703
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,520
You are the bitch.

704
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,360
You are the bitch.

705
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,440
You are the bitch.

706
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,280
I am not a bitch.

707
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,440
You are the bitch.

708
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,720
AfÅin!

709
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,200
Are you alright?

710
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,920
AfÅin, are you alright?

711
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,600
Don't just stand there.

712
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,760
Call an ambulance. Come on.

713
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,160
It is terrible.

714
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,640
How could she do
something like this?

715
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,920
She was a such a sweet girl.

716
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,480
- How is the boy?
- A minor wound.

717
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,656
The paramedic said
it is not life threatening.

718
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,840
In this case, she may as well
shoot him again.

719
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,480
How come such a young girl
can get hold of a gun?

720
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,120
Who gave it to her?

721
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,080
Apparently, it was her dad's.

722
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,360
She should've shot her dad then.
Like that boy did once.

723
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Nothing.

724
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,160
I think my blood pressure shot up.
I am going.

725
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,640
- Are you alright dad?
- I am O.K. I just don't feel too well.

726
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,400
I just need a little rest.
Come on.

727
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,080
I said I am O.K.

728
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,320
Me and Deva share a secret.

729
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,080
We have a secret.

730
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,480
Don't ever forget me Deva.

731
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:14,080
Don't ever forget me.

732
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,960
There you go.

733
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,240
Have a nice journey.

734
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,640
No crying.

735
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,880
Take really good care of yourself dad.
Don't forget to take your medication.

736
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,280
No, I won't. Don't worry.

737
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,360
Deva!

738
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,440
Son!

739
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,160
Have a nice journey.

740
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,000
I am sorry grandad.

741
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,760
Don't worry about it.
It happens, doesn't it?

742
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,960
It wasn't your fault.

743
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,416
What do you mean it wasn't my fault?
I was the reason for it all.

744
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,200
You weren't the
reason for anything.

745
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,480
You didn't do anything.
You didn't give her the gun.

746
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,120
The girl is sick, very sick.

747
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,360
But no one had noticed.
Even her own family.

748
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,200
How would you have known?

749
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,720
Apparently, she has been asking
for help for years.

750
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,880
By not talking to anyone, she was trying
to say "I have a problem".

751
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,480
But no one noticed.

752
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,120
Whatever.

753
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:36,960
Have a safe journey.

754
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,160
I apologize.

755
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,680
No crying.
You'll make me cry too.

756
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,920
Come on, get in the car.

757
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,040
Dad.

758
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,120
I thank you ever so much.

759
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,520
Why? What happened?

760
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,000
If it wasn't for you, there was no way
I could've got rid of Cemil.

761
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,256
We sat down, had a conversation
and sorted it all out. That's it.

762
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,680
Simple as that.

763
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:05,040
Mistakes are part of our lives.
Everybody makes mistakes.

764
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,040
Now, go on home. Take the
nice memories with you.

765
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,200
And tell your husband, if he gives you
hard time again, I am here.

766
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,920
- But I can't make it next time.
- Next time, I'll come over there.

767
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,840
O.K, off you go.
Have a safe journey.

768
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
O.K, we can go.

769
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,880
Staying away from
your daughter for years...

770
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,840
sending her to a boarding school so
that she wouldn't get mixed up...

771
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,680
with the likes of Cemil.

772
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,800
And what happens? In a big jungle like
Istanbul, she somehow ends up with him.

773
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,560
This is the price you pay
for keeping quiet years ago.

774
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,160
1 Week Later.

775
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,720
Nevra.

776
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,880
There is a delivery for you.

777
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,960
Come on darling, get up.

778
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,520
I made you something to eat.
I am not hungry.

779
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:32,600
Come on.

780
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,480
You'll make yourself ill.

781
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:35,800
Come on.

782
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,920
<i>Uskumru Street, Mebrure Blocks
Flat No:8 BeyoÄlu</i>.

783
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,720
<i>Door Lock Combination:1682</i>.

784
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,680
<i>Be there tomorrow morning</i>.

785
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:29,200
I met a girl today.
He name is Nevra Elmas.

786
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:37,520
<i>Today, 18th March</i>.

787
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,560
<i>It is Nevra's birthday.
I got her a present</i>.

788
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,200
Me and Nevra share a secret.

789
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:03,840
Last night, I saw a shooting-star.
And I made a wish.

790
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,880
I wish they all die.

791
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,280
Save me Nevra.

792
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,000
<i>Naimhan came around again today</i>.

793
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,280
<i>Salih beat me up</i>.

794
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,680
Today, Nevra left Kambura.

795
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:04,240
I wanted her to meet Vural
before she moved away.

796
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,920
I wanted my best friend to see
the person whom I'll marry.

797
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,880
I am going to meet him in the woods.
I want you to meet him.

798
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,280
So, we went to the woods.

799
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,560
But once there,
Vural said something really bad.

800
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,840
He said "now that Reyhan kissed you,
would she kiss me too".

801
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,720
<i>Her only objective is to be a
good cop and a good human being</i>.

802
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,760
Then Cemil came.

803
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,560
Will you not talk to me Reyhan?

804
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,280
I think she swallowed
her tongue.

805
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,520
Oh, look who is here.

806
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,600
Is she your friend?

807
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,840
What's your name?

808
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,400
She is cute too.

809
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,720
Come on, let's leave
the lovebirds alone.

810
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,120
Let's take a walk.

811
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,200
Nevra!

812
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,240
Come on.

813
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,000
Let's sit somewhere.

814
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,000
I've never seen you around.
Where are you from?

815
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,160
<i>Then Cemil appeared.
And I never saw Nevra again</i>.

816
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,200
<i>I hope Cemil hadn't done
anything bad to Nevra</i>.

817
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,880
Cemil.

818
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,760
<i>Kill</i>.

819
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,000
Where have you been?

820
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,080
You left the door open too.

821
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,000
You look such a mess.
Where do you play, in woods?

822
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Nevra?

823
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
Darling?

824
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:15,640
Has something happened?

825
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,480
Nevra?

826
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Darling?

827
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:24,640
Nevra?

828
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,680
Answer me darling.
Has something happened?

829
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,200
No mum. Nothing happened.

830
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:33,880
Darling?

831
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:23,080
<i>Cemil Havran will be available
to be killed tonight at 9 o'clock</i>.

832
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,360
Hello Nevra.

833
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,440
I am Agah BeyoÄlu.

834
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,280
It looks good on you.

835
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,680
You can take the head off.
There are no cameras here.

836
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,320
They are not fitted yet.

837
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,800
It can get too hot in there.
I know it too well.

838
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,440
I remembered.

839
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,280
I remembered everything.

840
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:37,200
I am elated.

841
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,600
Because I had begun to forget.

842
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:46,080
I have a little health problem.
I'll tell you later.

843
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:52,080
I thought, this girl's not doing anything.
May be, she doesn't remember.

844
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,760
Despite me sending her messages.

845
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:02,440
I thought, may be Cemil didn't do
anything to her.

846
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:06,040
I mean, I prayed to God
that he didn't.

847
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,720
But when I read about
what he did to Reyhan...

848
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,120
I thought, almost certainly that
he must've hurt Nevra too.

849
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,920
But Nevra doesn't remember.
She erased the memory.

850
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,960
And for the right reasons too.

851
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,360
You must've been so frightened.

852
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,080
I think we'd go insane if we remembered
everything that we've been through.

853
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:40,440
But sometimes, remembering is the
best way to keep one's sanity.

854
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,160
Whatever.

855
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:47,520
Now that you remember...

856
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,480
it means that I can forget
with peace of mind.

857
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,080
Why is there nobody here?
Why is the place empty?

858
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,880
It is not completed.
It requires a little more work.

859
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,920
That's what Cemil said.
He is the financier.

860
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:10,360
He said "the place is empty at night.
I'll take you there, show you the fish".

861
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,920
I said "O.K, take me there,
let's see the fish.".

862
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,160
It's amazing, isn't it?
Kids will love it.

863
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,240
Very nice.

864
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,000
So, you had no problem getting in,
did you?

865
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,360
You used the entrance that I told you.
I had left the door open for you.

866
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,760
Yes, that's right.

867
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,040
Do you know what happened?

868
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,640
I said to myself...

869
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,240
stay out of it.
She can do it alone.

870
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,400
Than I thought, it'd be like
trying to learn to swim.

871
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,680
Like jumping off from a jetty.

872
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,520
I thought I should be with her
when she makes her debut.

873
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:01,000
I think it was a wise decision.
Don't you think?

874
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,640
You almost got lost,
heading in wrong direction.

875
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,480
- Have you ever met Reyhan?
- No.

876
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,200
Never met her.

877
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,520
But I read that diary
so many times...

878
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:20,360
I think I know Reyhan
better than I know myself.

879
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,600
Cemil's bodyguards are outside.
You must've seen them.

880
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,800
And there is the
security as well.

881
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,280
Before they begin to barge in,
I think we should make our move.

882
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,640
Come on.

883
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,800
This way.

884
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,640
Come.

885
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,400
Nevra...

886
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,080
come.

887
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,760
This way.

888
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,080
Cemil is here.

889
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,560
Come on.

890
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,840
How could you...

891
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,680
how could you do it?

892
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:56,320
What's up?

893
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:58,600
What's up?

894
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:06,040
I can't do it.

895
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:09,200
I thought I could, but...

896
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,040
I can't kill another
human being.

897
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,920
But he is not human.

898
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,320
He is a monster.

899
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,160
No.

900
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,680
This is wrong.

901
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,800
I was in the police force.

902
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,240
This man should be arrested...

903
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,640
should be tried.

904
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,920
No, no. I think
you are confused.

905
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,800
He should be locked up.

906
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,920
You have to differentiate
law and justice.

907
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,400
They are two different things.

908
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:52,320
What you've just said is how it should be
done in accordance with the law.

909
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,520
Of course, providing that
there is law.

910
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,600
But justice is something different.

911
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,440
This is the justice.

912
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:01,600
What is justice anyway?

913
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,880
Self-defence?

914
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,760
Revenge?

915
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,480
Or belated self-defence?

916
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:12,840
This man ruined your life.

917
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,880
For example, think...

918
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,360
if you had a gun that day...

919
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,880
you would've shot Cemil to defend
yourself, wouldn't you?

920
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,600
Yes, you would. That's right.

921
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,640
Then or now.
What is the difference?

922
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:34,680
Then, you didn't have gun.
But now, you have one.

923
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,280
That's not why I became a cop.

924
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,920
That's exactly why
you became a cop.

925
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,800
You were neither able to save Reyhan,
nor yourself.

926
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,480
That's why you decided to become a
cop. It is so obvious.

927
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,640
I just...

928
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:12,560
I just wanted to be
a good person.

929
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,800
That's what I want too,
my dear child.

930
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
I want to be a good person, too.

931
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,480
This is a matter of
life and death.

932
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:27,160
He will die...

933
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,800
and we will live.

934
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:34,920
This is no justice.

935
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,720
It is a murder.

936
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:41,000
In this case, I'll help you
make a decision.

937
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,640
Put the gun down.

938
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,680
You have to make a choice.

939
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,120
You have to
kill either me or him.

940
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,400
Or I'll kill him right now.

941
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,400
Are you going to kill someone who
committed tens of murders...

942
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,040
or the man who hurt you
in most horrible way?

943
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,280
This man ruined your life.

944
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,320
These people ruined
Reyhan's life.

945
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,480
Reyhan is dead.
But they are still alive.

946
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,520
So, we might as well die and
let them live, what do you think?

947
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,600
This is a matter of
life and death.

948
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,440
Now...

949
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,080
I'll count to three...

950
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,200
then I'll shoot Cemil.

951
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:40,280
But who knows, you may pull the
trigger before I do.

952
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:48,680
I begin to count.

953
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,640
One.

954
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,520
Two.

955
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:26,160
1 Year Later.

956
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,680
Hi dad.

957
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,280
Hello darling.

958
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,120
How is the little one?
Give him to me, will you?

959
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,400
He only just fell asleep.

960
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,800
Where is your mum?

961
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:55,960
She is home.

962
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,000
She is exhausted,
trying to look after AteÅ.

963
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:00,960
I told her not to come.

964
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,720
Fine. Say hello.

965
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,800
I will.

966
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,360
- She said hello too.
- Bless her.

967
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,440
How is he?

968
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:17,800
What do you think?

969
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:19,880
Same.

970
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,760
Hi Uncle Agah.

971
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,360
Look what I got.

972
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,200
We'll put Miss Mebrure's
photo in it.

973
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,440
Why didn't you put the TV on?

974
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,800
It broke down again.
It keeps breaking down.

975
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,920
We're waiting for the repairman.

976
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,360
<i>I am pregnant.
What if I have a baby girl</i>?

977
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,120
<i>I'd rather die than
having a daughter</i>.

978
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,800
<i>Don't be afraid baby.
You're not going to be born</i>.

979
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,920
<i>I will die</i>.
